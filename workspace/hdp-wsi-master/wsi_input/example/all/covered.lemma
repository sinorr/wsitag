" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss .

The gifted students were assigned to normal classes , and it was only for math that they came together for a special class .

" In the past some licensing companies just did n't care and forced artists to sign licensing agreements that covered ' all ' of their works . And you know , this ' all ' included creative work done in the past , present and future . They really strongarmed them , " says Ivan Fan , deeply upset at this unfair treatment of the artists .  
When the company took control of the Bears this year , it immediately adopted Kaohsiung 's Cheng-Ching Lake Baseball Stadium and took a more professional tack in managing the team , improving the diet , clothing , living arrangements and transportation it provided to the players .

Subparagraph ( c ) was viewed as calling for further clarification : it was suggested that an exhaustive list of offences should be provided , to dispel the confusion created by the terms " serious violations " and " grave breaches " of the Geneva Conventions and to indicate whether the provision covered not only international but also internal armed conflicts taking into account the statute for the Rwanda Tribunal and the current reality of armed conflicts .  
The increase of $ 31,600 is required for the broader scope of information to be covered , such as new market potentials for products from developing countries , emerging new trading areas in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim , environmental aspects of international trade , women in development ; increased prices and shipping costs and the high prices of machine-readable data increasingly replacing traditional publications on the information market .

As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
In this connection , among the various aspects covered in the memorandum of understanding , one fact was underlined , namely , that it had been established that the restoration of sovereign organs involved the removal of all impediments to the normal functioning of State institutions , including the return of the assets of the respective organs .  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
While acknowledging that the problems covered by the mandate are multidimensional , ranging from structural or systemic to individual and less organized incursions against children , for which no single solution will ever be possible , the report nevertheless offers recommendations as to the first steps of a long , arduous journey .  
The conference papers , written by leading scholars , covered an extremely broad field in terms of geography and intellectual disciplines and were directly relevant to matters of great contemporary international concern .  
NULLThe estimates relating to human resources covered staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts , temporary staff hired for varying durations of time , consultants , contractual personnel and expert groups .  
Another basic theme of the regional programme is support for the economic and social reintegration of former combatants , demobilized military personnel and wounded victims of war and conflicts in the subregion , who are covered by specific peace agreements . 
The average monthly cost for the previous period was $ 5,000 , but requirements for the current period are expected to be much higher because , while some of these services were covered under the logistic support services contract during the last mandate , the new service contract does not provide for them , thus requiring use of local contractors to provide these services .  
The primary aim of the Special Rapporteur is to present an objective and impartial assessment of the human rights situation in all countries covered by the mandate on the basis of first-hand information gathered during her missions to the region , as well as information collected by the field operation established by the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat in the former Yugoslavia .

In our view , the preliminary estimate of resources now approved has provided the Secretary-General with the potential to absorb costs , up to the level of $ 70-million , relating to new and unforeseen mandates in the area of international peace and security , which , it was intended , should be covered by the proposed contingency provision .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
Also , the Main Committees should be encouraged to continue with the review of their respective agendas , taking into account , inter alia , the following : items that covered related matters or issues could be considered in agreed clusters ; the existing broad division of work among the Main Committees should be maintained .  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .

TAKASU ( Controller ) emphasized that the proposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General ( A / C . 5 / 50 / 30 ) were not intended to change the procedures governing the financing of unforeseen and extraordinary expenses , but rather the aim was simply to increase the annual limit of $ 5 million established by General Assembly resolutions 48 / 229 and 50 / 217 .  NULLThe three categories of activities covered by those resolutions were presented in table 1 of the report .

The Board recommended that action be taken to establish a reliable unified management information system and a comprehensive database , including high-value procurement cases that were exempted from the bidding process ; that detailed guidelines be established on the methods of invitation to bid covering the various aspects of procurement ; and that the requirements and appropriate categories of goods and services that could be covered by systems contracts be identified in advance through improved procurement planning ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol . I ) , sect .  
While all those procedural aspects are covered in a special chapter ( comprising a number of articles ) in other principal human rights treaties , in the case of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which does not have a treaty-based standing , more than a dozen Council resolutions and decisions were needed to complement the text of the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . Owing to this special " legal " situation , a decision by the Council could terminate the Committee 's existence .  
While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .  
In providing the financial resources needed by developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 4.1 of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.3 , take steps to facilitate this provision of financial resources , including the enhancement of transparency and the flexible and pragmatic application of its concept of incremental costs on a case-by-case basis ;  
The Committee is also concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in the areas covered by the Convention , as well as between central and local authorities .  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
Upon inquiry , the Advisory Committee was informed that the final list of former Fund participants to be covered by the proposed agreement included 349 former participants , as Russian citizens , from the initial list of 433 former participants who had had five or more years of contributory service and who had transferred their accrued pension rights under the provisions of the existing transfer agreements .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that with respect to the actuarial costs related to the identified 349 Russian citizens covered under the proposed agreement , as required by the protocol attached to the proposed agreement ( see annex VI to the Board 's report ) , revised actuarial estimates would be calculated , taking into account the new proposed implementation date , which was 1 January 1997 . 
Subject to those qualifications , his delegation supported the gist of the draft articles , in particular the dual criteria of " systematic " and " large - scale " for the crimes covered by articles 18 and 20 , the two separate jurisdictional regimes established in article 8 , and an exclusive regime for the crime of aggression ( article 16 ) subject to a limited exception of the national jurisdiction of a State committing aggression against its nationals .  
By the end of the period covered by the plan , strategic alliances for a collaborative programme of applied research and development within a network of selected training institutions will have been established , which will provide a framework for the continuing joint development , updating and testing of export success cases , training materials and capacity-building tools , methods and aids .  
Part one of the chapter covered a wide range of issues relating to the origins of international responsibility ; part two dealt with various aspects of the content , forms and degrees of international responsibility ; part three concerned the settlement of disputes ; and two annexes contained provisions relating to the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitral Tribunal envisaged in part three .  Part one had been completed in 1980 , and since then the Commission had concentrated on parts two and three .  
Turning to chapter V of the Commission 's report on international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , she said that it would be difficult to achieve a universal legal system which covered liability and compensation for harm arising out of acts which were unspecified , particularly in view of the variety of activities and harm that were potentially involved .  
Nevertheless , the period of time covered in his report ( A / 51 / 457 ) was very long and many of the matters referred to had already been resolved , as reflected in reports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Central America and on the progress made in the political , economic and social fields , particularly by the efforts to improve the judicial system , public security mechanisms and human rights institutions .  
Under this section , States parties are requested to provide information on the measures adopted to ensure that the civil rights and freedoms of children set forth in the Convention , in particular those covered by articles 7 , 8 , 13 to 17 and 37 ( a ) , are recognized by law specifically in relation to children and implemented in practice , including by administrative and judicial bodies , at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels .  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
MANOR ( Israel ) , speaking in explanation of vote before the voting , said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995 , and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way .  
Following the buyer 's refusal to pay the last part of the price on the grounds that the dismantled metal elements were defective , the Court of Appeal of Grenoble found that the disputed contract covered the sale of a used warehouse together with its dismantling and that it was apparent from the invoices submitted that the supply of services did not constitute the preponderant part [ of the contractual obligations ] .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
Because of the increasing number of developing countries that are actively engaged in space science research , the United Nations , through the Programme and the Committee , has in recent years placed increased emphasis on promoting education and research in space science and technology and , in particular , planetary exploration and astronomy ( topics covered in a guidebook3 published for International Space Year , 1992 ) , comprising what has come to be known in the international space community as basic space science .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
By section I , paragraph 12 of its decision 19 / 22 , the Council approved an extraordinary additional appropriation of Fund resources in 1998-1999 of up to $ 1-million for the management and administrative support costs budget , $ 500,000 of which would be earmarked for the costs associated with the anticipated special session in the event that they were not covered by the United Nations regular budget .  
Through the Treaty of Tlatelolco , whose thirtieth anniversary is being celebrated this year , the treaties of Rarotonga , Bangkok and Pelindaba , and the Antarctic Treaty , the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by these treaties are rapidly becoming free of nuclear weapons , as the General Assembly recognized with satisfaction last autumn .  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
After the fire , Thai government authorities allegedly relocated the toxic residues to a dumpsite in a military area in Kanchanaburi . The toxic waste is buried approximately 4 m underground and the entire 3,800 _ m2 area is covered with cement . 
These plants allegedly are not even required to provide information to workers or community residents about emissions or chemicals used or stored and numerous incidents have been reported : they include a case of children being intoxicated at a dump in Ciudad Juarez by sniffing green rocks covered with a solvent containing toluene , and a maquiladora that closed and left in an abandoned building a dozen 55-gallon drums of hazardous material .  
In response it was noted that the adjective " financial " had a narrow meaning in a number of legal systems , as related to transactions with currency , securities or stocks in the financial market .  Also the adjective " commercial " , which was used in some legal systems to refer to transactions covered by a particular body of law sometimes referred to as " commercial law " , might be interpreted as excluding certain categories of debtors whose transactions were not qualified as " commercial affairs " in those legal systems .  
Also , with a view to clarifying that paragraph ( 4 ) also covered insolvencies of individuals , it was proposed to redraft paragraph ( 4 ) to provide that , absent proof to the contrary , the registered office was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of a legal entity , and the habitual residence was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of an individual .  
Particularly relevant was the legislation enacted to control money-laundering and criminal assets in general , which included a broad number of criminal activities whose revenues were to be disguised through money-laundering schemes , the reversal of the onus probandi as to the source of the assets for those who were sentenced for one of the crimes covered by the law and the obligation for financial institutions to report any suspect transaction to the competent authorities .  
The Committee is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in areas covered by the Convention as well as between the central and local authorities .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
The Special Rapporteur suggests that special rapporteurs and working groups pay particular attention to the impact of emergency situations on the specific area covered by their respective mandates and that , as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has repeatedly stated , they should avail themselves of the valuable collaboration which the Special Rapporteur on human rights and states of emergency would be able to provide , in the event that such a Special Rapporteur were to be appointed by the Commission . 
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .

As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise .

After the PPI mapped out hunting grounds , it was discovered that these covered less than one-fifth of Wutai Rural Township .

" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss .

This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze .

Over half the school 's staff and pupils had to seek medical attention .  
Yang San-lang 's father , Yang Chung-tso , was a famous poet of that era , and this was the " Wang Creek Villa , " whose grounds covered 180,000 square feet .

Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan .

The gifted students were assigned to normal classes , and it was only for math that they came together for a special class .

Mutouyu , located at the northernmost part of the Penghu islands , is comprised entirely of rocks , with reefs on all sides .

It was appreciated that the report of the Secretary-General on sustainable mountain development ( E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 5 ) , in addition to technical aspects , also covered the social , economic and cultural aspects of human development in mountain areas .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
Subparagraph ( c ) was viewed as calling for further clarification : it was suggested that an exhaustive list of offences should be provided , to dispel the confusion created by the terms " serious violations " and " grave breaches " of the Geneva Conventions and to indicate whether the provision covered not only international but also internal armed conflicts taking into account the statute for the Rwanda Tribunal and the current reality of armed conflicts .  
The increase of $ 31,600 is required for the broader scope of information to be covered , such as new market potentials for products from developing countries , emerging new trading areas in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim , environmental aspects of international trade , women in development ; increased prices and shipping costs and the high prices of machine-readable data increasingly replacing traditional publications on the information market .  ( a ) Services in support of :

During the period covered by this report , the Mission verified complaints of alleged violations by both parties of the commitment to respect the human rights of wounded , captured and disabled combatants , as well as to end the suffering of the civilian population .  
The broad spectrum of activities of the countries covered above shows that the strategic planning initiative is not one specific blueprint but more of an agenda , an institutional vision which helps to direct , monitor and track performance to stated goals and objectives .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia until payment is effected .  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
In this connection , among the various aspects covered in the memorandum of understanding , one fact was underlined , namely , that it had been established that the restoration of sovereign organs involved the removal of all impediments to the normal functioning of State institutions , including the return of the assets of the respective organs .  
A special effort was made to bring to the Conference experts from industry , public and private , and to emphasize the practical issues and options of the conversion process .  The subjects covered included the nuclear industry , military machines , shipbuilding , electronics , aeronautical and aerospace industries , information , intellectual property and international cooperation .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
While acknowledging that the problems covered by the mandate are multidimensional , ranging from structural or systemic to individual and less organized incursions against children , for which no single solution will ever be possible , the report nevertheless offers recommendations as to the first steps of a long , arduous journey .  
The conference papers , written by leading scholars , covered an extremely broad field in terms of geography and intellectual disciplines and were directly relevant to matters of great contemporary international concern .  
NULLThe estimates relating to human resources covered staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts , temporary staff hired for varying durations of time , consultants , contractual personnel and expert groups .  
Another basic theme of the regional programme is support for the economic and social reintegration of former combatants , demobilized military personnel and wounded victims of war and conflicts in the subregion , who are covered by specific peace agreements . 
The average monthly cost for the previous period was $ 5,000 , but requirements for the current period are expected to be much higher because , while some of these services were covered under the logistic support services contract during the last mandate , the new service contract does not provide for them , thus requiring use of local contractors to provide these services .  
The primary aim of the Special Rapporteur is to present an objective and impartial assessment of the human rights situation in all countries covered by the mandate on the basis of first-hand information gathered during her missions to the region , as well as information collected by the field operation established by the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat in the former Yugoslavia .  
His delegation agreed that the crimes covered by the statute should be limited to war crimes , acts of genocide , violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed conflict , and crimes against humanity , all of which were forbidden under customary international law , and that treaty-based crimes such as those linked to drug trafficking and terrorism should be deleted .  
The parties to those negotiations had agreed that permanent status issues should be covered at a later stage of the political process and they had recognized that some issues were so complex and sensitive that an interim period was needed before dealing with them . 
At the end of the 12-month period provided in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates will be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable will remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
Obligations for personal services established in the current biennium shall be valid for the succeeding biennium , provided that appointments of the experts concerned are effected by the end of the current biennium and that the total period to be covered by obligations established for these purposes against the resources of the current biennium does not exceed 24 months ;  
This year 's international conferences HABITAT II , the World Food Summit and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development have marked the completion of a comprehensive series of United Nations-sponsored conferences which covered the full range of civil , political , economic and social issues that affect the peoples of the world .  
In our view , the preliminary estimate of resources now approved has provided the Secretary-General with the potential to absorb costs , up to the level of $ 70-million , relating to new and unforeseen mandates in the area of international peace and security , which , it was intended , should be covered by the proposed contingency provision .  
Proposes that , in addition to their special coverage in the World Population Monitoring reports , main demographic trends be covered biennially , starting in 1997 , in a complementary concise report prepared by the Population Division of the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the United Nations Secretariat , to be discussed under the agenda item concerning the work programme of the Population Division ;  
Also , the Main Committees should be encouraged to continue with the review of their respective agendas , taking into account , inter alia , the following : items that covered related matters or issues could be considered in agreed clusters ; the existing broad division of work among the Main Committees should be maintained .  
Genocide , aggression , systematic or mass violations of human rights , exceptionally serious war crimes , international terrorism and illicit traffic in narcotic drugs were covered in the draft ; those crimes represented the most serious breaches of the peace and security of mankind .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;

Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .

Recognizing that the export / import mechanism is not a regime for international licensing , but rather for the timely provision of information by States in which companies are located which are contemplating sales or supplies to Iraq of items covered by the plans for ongoing monitoring and verification and will not impede Iraq 's legitimate right to import or export for non-proscribed purposes , items and technology necessary for the promotion of its economic and social development ,

The major characteristics of the draft law might be summarized as follows : ( a ) money-laundering would be established as an offence with a broader definition , covering the proceeds of crime as money and monetary instruments , property and proceeds derived from any criminal activity ; ( b ) a confiscation provision with a broader coverage than existing provisions had been included ; ( c ) freezing and seizing of assets had been covered in specific provisions ; and ( d ) controlled delivery had been introduced for the first time .  
Within ECO , a committee had been established to coordinate regional cooperation , an expert group had been formed to prepare plans of action that would serve as a framework and mechanism for specific cooperative projects , and an action plan had been adopted for drug control in the region covered by ECO .  
Accordingly , most of the countries of the region maintained , and seemed to be consolidating , a pattern of economic performance characterized by moderate growth rates accompanied by moderate and diminishing inflation , large current account deficits covered by external capital , and low domestic savings rates .  
TAKASU ( Controller ) emphasized that the proposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General ( A / C . 5 / 50 / 30 ) were not intended to change the procedures governing the financing of unforeseen and extraordinary expenses , but rather the aim was simply to increase the annual limit of $ 5 million established by General Assembly resolutions 48 / 229 and 50 / 217 .  NULLThe three categories of activities covered by those resolutions were presented in table 1 of the report .  
The situation foreseen for the period covered by the plan calls for urban development policies that focus on economic , social and environmental aspects and will be designed as an integral part of wider regional planning policies .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus until payment is effected .

Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
The Board recommended that action be taken to establish a reliable unified management information system and a comprehensive database , including high-value procurement cases that were exempted from the bidding process ; that detailed guidelines be established on the methods of invitation to bid covering the various aspects of procurement ; and that the requirements and appropriate categories of goods and services that could be covered by systems contracts be identified in advance through improved procurement planning ( A / 51 / 5 ( Vol . I ) , sect .  
While all those procedural aspects are covered in a special chapter ( comprising a number of articles ) in other principal human rights treaties , in the case of the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , which does not have a treaty-based standing , more than a dozen Council resolutions and decisions were needed to complement the text of the Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . Owing to this special " legal " situation , a decision by the Council could terminate the Committee 's existence .  
While some support was expressed for the view that the current text ( in particular the words " exercise such powers . . . as the applicable foreign law may permit " ) adequately covered those instances , the prevailing view was that the text should express only the principle that the insolvency administrator is authorized to act in a foreign State without enumerating the types of measures or relief the administrator might be seeking .  
However , it was pointed out that the scope of the draft Model Provisions was limited to matters of judicial relief and cooperation and that the issues to which article 14 pertained could not be adequately dealt with in the Model Provisions , without addressing a number of other substantive issues which were not covered in the current text ( such as set-offs and actions to reverse or render unenforceable legal acts detrimental to all creditors , see above para .  134 ) .  
In providing the financial resources needed by developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 4.1 of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.3 , take steps to facilitate this provision of financial resources , including the enhancement of transparency and the flexible and pragmatic application of its concept of incremental costs on a case-by-case basis ;  
The Committee is also concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in the areas covered by the Convention , as well as between central and local authorities .  
The Committee also recommends that further measures be taken to gather systematic quantitative and qualitative data , disaggregated , inter alia , by age , gender , colour , rural / urban and social origin , on all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children , particularly the most disadvantaged groups .  
Upon inquiry , the Advisory Committee was informed that the final list of former Fund participants to be covered by the proposed agreement included 349 former participants , as Russian citizens , from the initial list of 433 former participants who had had five or more years of contributory service and who had transferred their accrued pension rights under the provisions of the existing transfer agreements .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that with respect to the actuarial costs related to the identified 349 Russian citizens covered under the proposed agreement , as required by the protocol attached to the proposed agreement ( see annex VI to the Board 's report ) , revised actuarial estimates would be calculated , taking into account the new proposed implementation date , which was 1 January 1997 . 
Subject to those qualifications , his delegation supported the gist of the draft articles , in particular the dual criteria of " systematic " and " large - scale " for the crimes covered by articles 18 and 20 , the two separate jurisdictional regimes established in article 8 , and an exclusive regime for the crime of aggression ( article 16 ) subject to a limited exception of the national jurisdiction of a State committing aggression against its nationals .  
By the end of the period covered by the plan , strategic alliances for a collaborative programme of applied research and development within a network of selected training institutions will have been established , which will provide a framework for the continuing joint development , updating and testing of export success cases , training materials and capacity-building tools , methods and aids .  
Part one of the chapter covered a wide range of issues relating to the origins of international responsibility ; part two dealt with various aspects of the content , forms and degrees of international responsibility ; part three concerned the settlement of disputes ; and two annexes contained provisions relating to the Conciliation Commission and the Arbitral Tribunal envisaged in part three .  Part one had been completed in 1980 , and since then the Commission had concentrated on parts two and three .  
Turning to chapter V of the Commission 's report on international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law , she said that it would be difficult to achieve a universal legal system which covered liability and compensation for harm arising out of acts which were unspecified , particularly in view of the variety of activities and harm that were potentially involved .  
Nevertheless , the period of time covered in his report ( A / 51 / 457 ) was very long and many of the matters referred to had already been resolved , as reflected in reports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Central America and on the progress made in the political , economic and social fields , particularly by the efforts to improve the judicial system , public security mechanisms and human rights institutions .  
Under this section , States parties are requested to provide information on the measures adopted to ensure that the civil rights and freedoms of children set forth in the Convention , in particular those covered by articles 7 , 8 , 13 to 17 and 37 ( a ) , are recognized by law specifically in relation to children and implemented in practice , including by administrative and judicial bodies , at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels .  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
MANOR ( Israel ) , speaking in explanation of vote before the voting , said that the draft resolution was superfluous because the issue of rights over natural resources had been covered in the Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement signed on 28 September 1995 , and should be settled within the framework of the direct negotiations on permanent status already under way .  
Following the buyer 's refusal to pay the last part of the price on the grounds that the dismantled metal elements were defective , the Court of Appeal of Grenoble found that the disputed contract covered the sale of a used warehouse together with its dismantling and that it was apparent from the invoices submitted that the supply of services did not constitute the preponderant part [ of the contractual obligations ] .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
Thirdly , the relationship between the States themselves : instead of waging propaganda wars and in some cases even resorting to economic coercion and the use of military force to deal with ethnic tensions and situations involving minorities in other countries , States should rely on the legal means provided by international human rights instruments , in particular the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination , which contained a provision allowing States to make a complaint when they were not satisfied with the performance of another State in matters covered by the Convention .  
Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
Because of the increasing number of developing countries that are actively engaged in space science research , the United Nations , through the Programme and the Committee , has in recent years placed increased emphasis on promoting education and research in space science and technology and , in particular , planetary exploration and astronomy ( topics covered in a guidebook3 published for International Space Year , 1992 ) , comprising what has come to be known in the international space community as basic space science .  
The presentations at the Workshop covered remote sensing , satellite communications and broadcasting in combination with electronic networking , satellite meteorology , satellite positioning systems and how they could be used , separately or in combination , to prevent , warn , monitor and mitigate the effects of disasters such as flooding , drought , landslides , earthquakes , volcanic eruptions , fires , environmental degradation and regional and global phenomena such as El Ni �� .  
By section I , paragraph 12 of its decision 19 / 22 , the Council approved an extraordinary additional appropriation of Fund resources in 1998-1999 of up to $ 1-million for the management and administrative support costs budget , $ 500,000 of which would be earmarked for the costs associated with the anticipated special session in the event that they were not covered by the United Nations regular budget .  
Through the Treaty of Tlatelolco , whose thirtieth anniversary is being celebrated this year , the treaties of Rarotonga , Bangkok and Pelindaba , and the Antarctic Treaty , the southern hemisphere and adjacent areas covered by these treaties are rapidly becoming free of nuclear weapons , as the General Assembly recognized with satisfaction last autumn .  
The Committee is concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
Dr Yves Sandoz , Director of International Law and Policy , International Committee of the Red Cross , noted that the starting point of the Workshop was the recognition that protection afforded to the victims of internal violence covered by international humanitarian law was inadequate ; the Workshop was an attempt to escape from the endless debate on the applicability of international law and of human rights instruments in clarifying rules applicable in all situations .  
After the fire , Thai government authorities allegedly relocated the toxic residues to a dumpsite in a military area in Kanchanaburi . The toxic waste is buried approximately 4 m underground and the entire 3,800 _ m2 area is covered with cement . 
These plants allegedly are not even required to provide information to workers or community residents about emissions or chemicals used or stored and numerous incidents have been reported : they include a case of children being intoxicated at a dump in Ciudad Juarez by sniffing green rocks covered with a solvent containing toluene , and a maquiladora that closed and left in an abandoned building a dozen 55-gallon drums of hazardous material .  
In response it was noted that the adjective " financial " had a narrow meaning in a number of legal systems , as related to transactions with currency , securities or stocks in the financial market .  Also the adjective " commercial " , which was used in some legal systems to refer to transactions covered by a particular body of law sometimes referred to as " commercial law " , might be interpreted as excluding certain categories of debtors whose transactions were not qualified as " commercial affairs " in those legal systems .  
Also , with a view to clarifying that paragraph ( 4 ) also covered insolvencies of individuals , it was proposed to redraft paragraph ( 4 ) to provide that , absent proof to the contrary , the registered office was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of a legal entity , and the habitual residence was deemed to be the centre of the main interests of an individual .  
Particularly relevant was the legislation enacted to control money-laundering and criminal assets in general , which included a broad number of criminal activities whose revenues were to be disguised through money-laundering schemes , the reversal of the onus probandi as to the source of the assets for those who were sentenced for one of the crimes covered by the law and the obligation for financial institutions to report any suspect transaction to the competent authorities .  
The Committee is concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in areas covered by the Convention as well as between the central and local authorities .  
The Committee is also concerned at the lack of an integrated strategy on children as well as of a fully effective monitoring mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention and in relation to all groups of children in urban and rural areas , especially those affected by the consequences of the economic problems and by the internal conflict .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
Urges the Secretary General , from within existing resources , to make all necessary resources available for the Special Rapporteur to carry out her mandate successfully and in particular to provide her with adequate staff based in the territories covered by her mandate to ensure effective continuous monitoring of the human rights situation there and coordination with other international organizations involved . 
This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
The Special Rapporteur suggests that special rapporteurs and working groups pay particular attention to the impact of emergency situations on the specific area covered by their respective mandates and that , as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has repeatedly stated , they should avail themselves of the valuable collaboration which the Special Rapporteur on human rights and states of emergency would be able to provide , in the event that such a Special Rapporteur were to be appointed by the Commission . 
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina until payment is effected .

Urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law , and to implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with international standards , in particular by concluding all investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive review with United Nations and local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law which are not covered by the amnesty in order to end proceedings against all individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence ;  
Urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to eliminate ambiguities in implementation of the Amnesty Law , and to implement it fairly and objectively in accordance with international standards , in particular by concluding all investigations of crimes covered by the amnesty and undertaking an immediate and comprehensive review with United Nations and local Serb participation of all charges outstanding against individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law which are not covered by the amnesty in order to end proceedings against all individuals against whom there is insufficient evidence ;  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
In addition , an extraordinary appropriation of $ 1-million was approved by the Governing Council , comprising $ 500,000 for studies requested by the Governing Council for activities directly related to the implementation of improved management and administrative practices by UNEP , and $ 500,000 for the costs associated with the anticipated special session of the Governing Council in the event that these costs are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations .

Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation .

Mr . Snijders ( Suriname ) : Before the Rio Conference and the adoption of Agenda 21 , successive Governments and the people of the Republic of Suriname , 90 per cent of which is covered by tropical rainforest , were able to recognize the need to pursue sustainable economic development , while at the same time safeguarding the environment.Thus they recognized their moral obligation to conserve the rainforest and a sound environment for future generations .  
The Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom knows better than anyone else that the methods he has been employing in the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are prompted by narrow political considerations inimical to Iraq and have played a large part in impeding implementation of the oil-for-food programme and in delaying the arrival of foodstuffs and basic necessities covered by the provisions of this programme .

That Convention was broader in substantive terms since it covered civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , while the European Convention prohibited racial discrimination in the framework of civil and political rights .  
It should be stressed that some of these gross breaches are distinct legal wrongs in themselves , since the definition of the wrong of itself ensures that only severe or extreme cases are covered ( e.g . genocide , crimes against humanity ) .

In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .
