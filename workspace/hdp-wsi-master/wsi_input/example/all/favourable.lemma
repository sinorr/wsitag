With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,

The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .

The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .

The Economic and Social Council , at its 1997 substantive session , had approved a set of agreed conclusions recognizing that the creation and preservation of stable international conditions and the democratization of international relations were among the main elements of a favourable environment for development .  
However , these improvements would remain transitory and frail unless accompanied by policies at both the national and the international levels favourable to strong institutional and technological capacity-building .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .

Although it is important to create favourable conditions for the flow of direct foreign capital to African countries , the owners of this capital should understand the needs and the problems of African countries and should focus on a number of priority questions , in particular the development of human resources conducive to a productive labour force , which is essential for economic growth , and support for self-development in society , based on the concept that human beings are the means and the ends of development . 
While the Dayton Peace Agreement has laid a constructive basis for the cessation of armed hostilities and the creation of a favourable climate for the formation of a stable and durable structure of state in Bosnia and Herzegovina , a great deal needs to be done to translate the pious desire of the international community into a working reality .  
The general political climate prevailing in international relations is creating a set of circumstances that are favourable for the methodical pursuit of the work of disarmament , whose process of multilateral negotiations should be revitalized .  
The favourable risk assessment was based on the generally sound macroeconomic policies and continued economic liberalization pursued by most Governments as well as the high rates of domestic investment and savings .  
We hope that the two parties concerned will put the interests of Croatian people of all ethnic origins above their differences , adopt a constructive approach , build mutual trust and implement the Basic Agreement in earnest so as to create conditions favourable for advancing the process of achieving a political settlement of the question of Croatia .  
Non-governmental organizations , particularly those in the north , were doing a remarkable job in the fields of advocacy and protection , and , thanks to the joint action of the international community , States and non-governmental organizations , international public opinion was becoming favourable to the idea of controlling and combating all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief .  
Furthermore , as the participants at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen had underscored , the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms as well the strengthening of democracy within the framework of equitable economic relations and a favourable international economic environment were an integral part of social development .  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizing that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Commending continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access ,  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
Affirming that effective measures and the creation of favourable conditions for the promotion and protection of the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities , ensuring effective non-discrimination and equality for all , contribute to the prevention and peaceful solution of human rights problems and situations involving minorities ,  
Recalling also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
A supportive national environment and a favourable international climate are necessary conditions for achieving economic growth , and a supportive national environment must be based on pragmatic policies in which Governments can no longer be assumed to be paramount economic agents .  
In seeking a common standard of achievement for all people and all countries in the area of human rights , the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , called upon all nations , regions and the international community to create favourable conditions for and effective enjoyment of basic human rights .  
It remained the principal producer of illicit opiates in the Golden Triangle of south-east Asia and the major source of heroin found in the illicit North American market in 1994 / 95 , taking advantage of favourable political developments , UNDCP assisted the Government in the elaboration of an alternative development project involving a minority group ( the Wa ) in northern Myanmar .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
Real interest rates were generally favourable ; in cases where real rates rose significantly , the monetary authorities again faced the dilemma of either allowing capital inflows to exert downward pressure on real exchange rates or seeking to sterilize the monetary impact of the flow of funds at the risk of creating a vicious circle that would stimulate new capital inflows .  
Barring adverse weather conditions , the progress made in enhancing political and social stability in some countries and the benefits accruing from the impact of domestic economic-policy reforms , coupled with favourable developments in the international economic environment , lead to estimates of regional growth in output of 2.9 per cent in 1996 , as against 2.3 per cent in 1995 .  
Links should be established or reinforced with media to avoid the negative reporting on children and youth in especially difficult circumstances and to further specific messages to enhance positive , social values fostering favourable conditions for accepting these children back into society .  
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
It reached the understanding that , while there would be no change in the procedure , the following categories of items would generally receive favourable consideration : medical equipment ; packaging material for medical supplies and foodstuffs ; clothing ; supplies for babies and infants ; soaps ; animal feed and animals and eggs for breeding or hatching purposes ; agricultural seeds ; supplies and materials for primary and secondary education ; spare parts and materials for water treatment and sewage plants ; and storage facilities for grain and foodstuffs . 
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
The revision of this legislation has introduced an essential flexibility in the conditions governing the establishment of associations by replacing the rather strict requirement of prior authorization by a much more flexible and basically more favourable requirement of a simple declaration to the authorities , by virtue of which the association is deemed constituted unless the authorities object within the period of 46 days specified by the Act of 2 April 1992 .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation called for urgent and immediate generation of political will in the international community to follow up and implement the recommendations of recent United Nations conferences , in particular commitments to new and additional financing for development and creation of a favourable international economic environment , inter alia , through transfer of technology and enhanced trade access of products from developing countries .  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
Although it acknowledged the critical role of national policies in that regard and the Organization 's efforts to raise awareness in the world community , it believed that sustainable development required a favourable international economic environment .  
Firstly , it had been recognized that the relatively favourable economic situation was not a fortuitous outcome , but the product of many years of hard work and sacrifice in pursuit of sound economic policies at both the national and international levels .  
Now that the countries of the Rio Group had implemented the adjustments and modernizations required for their social and economic development , and in order to achieve the objectives of the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation and the International Development Strategy , it was to be hoped that the developed countries would also assume their responsibility to create a favourable international environment for cooperation and economic development , especially with regard to the developing countries .  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
The Heads of State called for the all-round development of trade and economic cooperation among the Turkish-speaking countries , the expansion of economic ties at various levels , the promotion of economic integration processes , the elimination of obstacles to joint trade and the establishment of a favourable legal regime for individuals and legal entities engaging in economic cooperation in order to create a single market for goods , services , capital and labour , without prejudice to their international obligations .  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
His Government was firmly committed to taking part in the activities planned for the final term of the Decade , and was confident that the Decade would make a significant contribution to the progressive development of international law , particularly in creating favourable legal conditions for the justice which was the basis for lasting peace .  
Concessional , bilateral contributions from the developed countries were crucial in that regard , as was a favourable international economic environment , characterized by improved access to markets , stable exchange rates , effectively managed international interest rates , increased resource flows and access by the developing countries to technology .  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
Notes that while sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country to promote macroeconomic stability are essential elements for determining the volume and structure of private capital flows , international macroeconomic policies play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness , and should contribute to creating a favourable international economic environment ;  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
PASHAYEV ( Azerbaijan ) said that drug abuse , illegal drug trafficking and crime were increasing at alarming rates and had serious political , economic and social implications for countries , particularly the newly independent States , which had been confronted with problems resulting from aggression , large numbers of refugees and displaced persons , economies in transition and a geographical situation favourable to drug dealers .  
It was noted , however , that BOT and similar projects could be quite complex and that their implementation required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
Also to be considered is the expansion of United Nations efforts to achieve agreement on key issues required for a favourable environment for business , such as uniform commercial codes and intellectual property and accounting standards , and to deal with transnational problems , such as crime and corruption , which inhibit both good governance and good business .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Some people have thought that the end of the so-called cold war would be conducive to the creation of favourable conditions for equitable and healthy international relations based on mutual respect and fruitful and constructive cooperation among human communities .  
It is relevant here to highlight the need for the international community to continue its cooperation with the Central American countries by providing the required economic , financial and technical assistance in sustained fashion and on favourable terms in order to make the goals of the programme of sustainable development in Central America achievable .  
With regard to measures adopted for ethnic minorities and other social groups , these are designed , inter alia , to guarantee to indigenous and tribal peoples and to ethnic minorities especially favourable treatment as regards access to educational facilities and employment in the public or private sector .  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Reiterates that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ;  
It was said that a reference to bilateral or multilateral international agreements within the context of article I should be avoided unless : ( a ) the Working Group came to the conclusion that it was not feasible to establish harmonized rules of recognition ; or ( b ) such a reference related to agreements that provided a more favourable level of recognition of foreign certificates than the one provided in the draft uniform rules .  
The ultimate objective of BITs from the point of view of developing host countries is to contribute to a favourable investment climate , with a view to attracting more FDI flows and , ultimately , advancing the economic and social development of the host countries involved .  
Emphasizes the need for new flows of financial resources to the indebted developing countries , and urges the creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase financial assistance on favourable terms as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty , and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
At the current stage of geological and geotechnical knowledge of the site , there are favourable prospects for the technical feasibility of the proposed tunnels at an acceptable level of assurance , this being understood in the context of the practical needs for detailed information and the practical difficulties of meeting those needs through off-shore surveying .  
Measures that have been adopted by some political parties include setting aside for women a certain minimum number or percentage of positions on their executive bodies , ensuring that there is a balance between the number of male and female candidates nominated for election , and ensuring that women are not consistently assigned to less favourable constituencies or to the least advantageous positions on a party list .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
Noting also that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment both at the national and the international level ,  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies in each country for promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility for securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods and the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
However , even with sufficient resources , the initiative 's main goal of reaching external debt sustainability would be unattainable unless a favourable international economic climate were created to provide open access to markets , modern technologies and sources of development financing .  
The Economic and Social Council , at its 1997 substantive session , had approved a set of agreed conclusions recognizing that the creation and preservation of stable international conditions and the democratization of international relations were among the main elements of a favourable environment for development .  
However , these improvements would remain transitory and frail unless accompanied by policies at both the national and the international levels favourable to strong institutional and technological capacity-building .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Those efforts would be in vain unless effective and sound development policies at the national level were supported by non-discriminatory economic relations and a favourable international economic environment .  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Stressing the fact that realization of the full range of human rights requires effective policies and compliance at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Reaffirming that lasting progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , as well as equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ,  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
It was noted , however , that the implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects required a favourable legal framework that fostered the confidence of potential investors , national and foreign , while protecting public interests .  
Lastly , with regard to the question of foreign debt , there is now broad agreement that without favourable treatment for the stock of African debt , particularly in the most heavily indebted countries , no economic recovery programme can produce the desired long-term positive effects .  
If we do not create an international environment favourable to economic growth and sustainable and comprehensive development , it will be almost impossible , particularly for the large majority of third world countries , to make steady progress along the road to social development .  
The Organization 's unrivalled role in the field of development , whether analytical , normative or operational , and in contributing to the creation of a favourable international milieu for development , hardly needs to be emphasized .  
While recognizing that the primary responsibility for nuclear safety rests with the respective national Governments , the European Union welcomes the entry into force of this Convention , which was concluded under IAEA auspices and which will strengthen cooperation and mutual assistance in a favourable climate for the development a global nuclear-safety culture . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Stresses that sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and that the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness ;  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
The High Contacting Parties shall ensure favourable conditions for direct trade and other economic relations and cooperation at the level of administrative and territorial units in accordance with national legislation currently in force , devoting special attention to the development of economic ties between border regions .  
Sound domestic macroeconomic policies of each country in regard to promoting macroeconomic stability and growth are primary elements for determining private capital flows , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies , where appropriate , and a favourable international economic environment play an important role in reinforcing their effectiveness .  
While it is recognized that States have the primary responsibility in securing a sound and stable national political , economic and social environment for development , international support , at the request of interested Governments , and the creation of a favourable international economic environment are crucial ingredients in this effort .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development .
