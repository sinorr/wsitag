We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
This dual objective can not be achieved unless existing stockpiles of weapons-usable fissile material form an integral part of the negotiations , as reflected in the report of the Special Coordinator on this issue in the Conference on Disarmament and as indicated in the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee established within its framework .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
On 4 October 1994 , the Governments of China and of the United States issued a joint statement whereby the two Governments agreed to work together to promote the earliest possible achievement of a multilateral , non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
The Ministers expressed their support for the completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty no later than 1996 as well as the early conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminating and universally applicable convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
However , zero nuclear weapons might not be a stable , reassuring zero unless all fissile material , and the dedicated nuclear infrastructure , has been placed under satisfactory international control .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
For the international regime for the storage and control of plutonium , the question for the near future is hardly whether or not to establish a full-fledged regime , but whether to prepare a legal framework and an option for countries to deposit fissile material when they deem that desirable , hence proceeding in a gradual , pragmatic fashion .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
I urge each of you to consider the reinforcing impact that an FMCT would have on parallel efforts to dismantle nuclear warheads , to place fissile material that is determined to be excess to national security requirements under safeguards , and to achieve even deeper nuclear weapons reductions leading toward their eventual elimination .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
A fundamental prerequisite for transparency would be the application of consistent and strict standards of accounting and secure handling and storage procedures for fissile material at the national level .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
It tries to make the discussions at the fissile material negotiations , to take place in Geneva , more meaningful and more fruitful , eventually leading , I hope soon , to a complete , effective , integrated system based on the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
In this regard it may be necessary to develop a separate set of verification methods and procedures that will enhance international confidence that fissile material subject to control is not returned to nuclear _ weapons programmes , while at the same time ensuring that the inspectors do not gain access to classified information .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Out of a total quantity of fissile material of weapons _ grade quality , which is estimated at roughly 2,000 tons , almost 1,400 tons constitute so _ called transitional material , in other words , declared or undeclared excess material .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
Canada indicated in its statement of March 18 , 1999 , concerning the negotiation of a " non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices " its considered view as to how the issue of fissile material stockpiles should be addressed by those states possessing such stockpiles .  
To re-establish , under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
India has also supported under Conference agenda item 1 the establishment of an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the special coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Recalls the decision by the Conference on Disarmament2 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator3 and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
Intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 199532 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Looking beyond START III negotiations , it seems clear to us that the prospects for negotiating deeper reductions would be enhanced if we have in place a dependable cap on fissile material for weapons , as well as confidence that the international community would detect illegal production.An FMCT also would help make nuclear arms reductions irreversible . 
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
It called for parallel negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a comprehensive agreement banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices pursuant to paragraph 4 of the decision on Principles and objectives of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
One of the principal characteristics of such an international instrument must be its non _ discriminatory nature in the sense that a uniform regime for strict international verification should be applied to all States and to all facilities capable of producing fissile material in all States without exception .  
On the other hand , such a treaty must be internationally and effectively verifiable , which means that the international instrument to be negotiated should be based on absolute transparency , which implies that all facilities anywhere in the world that are involved in the process of the production or storage of fissile material must be subject to a strict regime of control and inspection .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
Equally important , the draft resolution draws attention to the importance of ongoing efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons and the need to ensure that excess fissile material is handled in a safe and effective way .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States had dismantled more than 13,000 warheads , a process which included the physical separation of the warheads conventional high explosive from its fissile material .  
His delegation looked forward to the resumption and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a binding universal legal instrument banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Calls also for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
In the new millennium , other priorities include eliminating the so-called tactical nuclear weapons ; banning fissile materials for weapons purposes ; arresting the acquisition of advanced weapons of mass destruction ; maintaining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime ; and concluding an international convention against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear-weapon States .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .  
This dual objective can not be achieved unless existing stockpiles of weapons-usable fissile material form an integral part of the negotiations , as reflected in the report of the Special Coordinator on this issue in the Conference on Disarmament and as indicated in the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee established within its framework .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Kenya looks forward to the commencement of negotiations on a non-discriminatory and universally applicable convention banning the production and stockpiling of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices , and supports the convening of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament , especially as it will accelerate the negotiations on pending conventions in the field of disarmament .  
On 4 October 1994 , the Governments of China and of the United States issued a joint statement whereby the two Governments agreed to work together to promote the earliest possible achievement of a multilateral , non-discriminatory and effectively verifiable convention banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
The Ministers expressed their support for the completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the negotiations on a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty no later than 1996 as well as the early conclusion of negotiations on a non-discriminating and universally applicable convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The European Union urges the Conference on Disarmament , also pursuant to the Principles and Objectives agreed to at the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference , to proceed to negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , a so-called cut-off convention .  
We note with satisfaction the work done by the parties concerned on guidelines for the management of civil plutonium , which would constitute an important complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration on the safe and effective management of weapons fissile material designated as no longer required for defence purposes , inter alia , through the Nuclear Suppliers Group controls on the traffic in nuclear materials , which would be safely stored , protected and placed under IAEA safeguards .  
It highlights the importance of measures to give full effect to the provisions of article VI of the NPT , including a programme of action , a treaty on the total prohibition of nuclear testing , a convention on the production of fissile material and , lastly , the commitment of nuclear-weapon States to move systematically and gradually forward so as to reduce nuclear weapons as a whole and then eliminate them , and the determination of all States to work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
However , zero nuclear weapons might not be a stable , reassuring zero unless all fissile material , and the dedicated nuclear infrastructure , has been placed under satisfactory international control .  
Growing stocks of surplus fissile material from the military sector and growing amounts of plutonium in civilian fuel cycles make accountancy and control an urgent task of paramount importance .  
For the international regime for the storage and control of plutonium , the question for the near future is hardly whether or not to establish a full-fledged regime , but whether to prepare a legal framework and an option for countries to deposit fissile material when they deem that desirable , hence proceeding in a gradual , pragmatic fashion .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
The intensive consultations led by your distinguished predecessor Ambassador Yung Sun showed that within these two fields there are at least three issues commanding quite broad support , namely the fissile material cut _ off , nuclear disarmament and the complex issue of anti _ personnel landmines . 
The consultations proved to be useful , allowing me to see better where delegations stand as far as their positions on three important issues are concerned : namely , on nuclear disarmament , the fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , as well as , in some cases , on other issues of major interest to them . 
So if we are not able to solve the daunting issue of nuclear disarmament in one great stroke now , let us attend to what is feasible and in doing so add another valuable facet , namely a treaty on fissile material cut _ off ( FMCT ) , to this multifaceted edifice .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The START process must be revitalized and broadened to include other nuclear-weapon States promises and intentions must be converted into actions ; the nuclear-weapon States must progressively and dynamically demonstrate their fulfilment of their NPT obligation to negotiate in good faith and to conclude negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament ; the NPT review process must continue to be a qualitatively different and enhanced exercise ; and the Conference on Disarmament must overcome its current stalemate and move forward decisively and responsibly on nuclear disarmament and a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
In the context of nuclear disarmament , it is the indispensable prerequisite for the further advancement of nuclear disarmament , because it is impossible to move forward with the dismantlement of nuclear weapons unless the safe and effective management of resultant fissile material is secured .  
The immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty has repeatedly been identified by the international community as the next major goal for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament efforts , most recently by the parties to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty which now has more members than the United Nations itself at their first preparatory meeting for the sixth Review Conference in 2000 . 
This is a significant complement to the Moscow Nuclear Summit Declaration of April 1996 on the safe and effective management of the fissile material of nuclear weapons identified as being no longer required for national defence purposes .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
Nonetheless , several issues are still pending , such as the formalization of an agreement to ban the production and stockpiling of fissile material for military use ; the establishment of adequate and legally binding guarantees for non-nuclear-weapon States ; and the strengthening of existing multilateral safeguard mechanisms .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
We also remain hopeful that on the basis of the continued commitments of member States of the Conference to the shared goals of global disarmament it will be able to resolve the many difficult issues on its agenda , including the contentious issue of a fissile cut _ off .  
In the nuclear area , if we consider the United Nations General Assembly , the venue for the highest expression of international public opinion , I must note that in 1993 , in resolution 48 / 75 L , the Assembly recommended by consensus the negotiation in the most appropriate forum of a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons .  
Reference is made to the sequential listing therein of three objectives under a Nuclear disarmament heading : the CTBT , the fissile materials convention , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons , and by all States of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . upon the prior attainment of the fissile materials production ban ? 
Many of us believe that a multilateral , effectively verifiable treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices will constitute a prerequisite step in the way towards a nuclear _ weapon _ free world .  
The mandate contained in the report of Ambassador Shannon indeed made no explicit reference to the existing stockpiles of fissile material , but it acknowledged that this issue to which many delegations attach great importance can not be isolated with the Conference starts actual negotiations .  
Germany has already stated its priorities for this work programme : the immediate start of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off and on an effective , legally binding international agreement to ban anti _ personnel mines .  
Having accomplished its work on the CTBT , the CD must continue to play its role in non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament by starting , without further delay , its overdue work on a treaty to prohibit the production of fissile material for use in nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , otherwise referred to as the cut _ off convention ( FMCT ) .  
On a multilateral level , the next logical step is for the CD to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator dated 24 March 1995 and contained in document CD / 1299 , and the mandate contained therein .  
We strongly agree with an eloquent remark by Italian Ambassador Balboni Acqua during his statement last Thursday : It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
I urge each of you to consider the reinforcing impact that an FMCT would have on parallel efforts to dismantle nuclear warheads , to place fissile material that is determined to be excess to national security requirements under safeguards , and to achieve even deeper nuclear weapons reductions leading toward their eventual elimination .  
In looking ahead toward post _ START III negotiations , nuclear arms reductions would be far more difficult without a ban on new fissile material production for weapons embodied in a treaty that provides confidence that the international community would detect clandestine production .  
We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
We heard one such unfortunate remark at last week 's plenary when it was asserted that the five declared nuclear Powers want the CD to discuss only small items such as anti _ personnel landmines and a fissile material cut _ off treaty .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
In a perfect world , it would be desirable to negotiate a single treaty which addressed both future production of fissile material , as well as existing stockpiles .  
While a multilateral and effectively verifiable agreement to cease future production of fissile material may be possible now , it is our strong view that the cut _ off treaty should not try comprehensively to address existing stocks .  
It is inconceivable to permit fissile materials to be manufactured while nuclear tests are being banned and existing fissile material is being destroyed .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
We are aware of an existing view that the cut _ off of future fissile material production is a non-proliferation issue unrelated to nuclear disarmament .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
A fundamental prerequisite for transparency would be the application of consistent and strict standards of accounting and secure handling and storage procedures for fissile material at the national level .  
An FMCT is , strictly speaking , not in itself an instrument of disarmament since no single warhead will be dismantled because of it , and the quantity of fissile material available for nuclear arms will be frozen at its current level .  
Once an FMCT has been adopted , there would be a reasonable chance that the main nuclear _ weapon States would commit themselves voluntarily to placing irreversible fissile material transferred from military uses to civilian ones under full IAEA safeguards .  
It tries to make the discussions at the fissile material negotiations , to take place in Geneva , more meaningful and more fruitful , eventually leading , I hope soon , to a complete , effective , integrated system based on the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The Chinese delegation supports the re _ establishment of an ad hoc committee on the basis of the mandate contained in the Shannon report to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices in accordance with United Nations General Assembly resolution 48 / 75 L . 
Almost a month ago the Italian Under _ Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs , Ms . Patrizia Toia , speaking before the Conference , formulated an urgent request for the immediate re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
In this regard it may be necessary to develop a separate set of verification methods and procedures that will enhance international confidence that fissile material subject to control is not returned to nuclear _ weapons programmes , while at the same time ensuring that the inspectors do not gain access to classified information .  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
Out of a total quantity of fissile material of weapons _ grade quality , which is estimated at roughly 2,000 tons , almost 1,400 tons constitute so _ called transitional material , in other words , declared or undeclared excess material .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Also in August last year , the Conference on Disarmament established an ad hoc committee under item 1 of its agenda , to negotiate a ' non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ' .  
Canada indicated in its statement of March 18 , 1999 , concerning the negotiation of a " non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices " its considered view as to how the issue of fissile material stockpiles should be addressed by those states possessing such stockpiles .  
To re-establish , under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
According to that paragraph , the Conference would decide to re _ establish , under item 1 of the agenda , entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Fifty years ago the ban on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons was supposed to be the real tool in preventing the nuclear arms race , which had been unleashed between the two antagonistic super _ Powers .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
The re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate , on the basis of the report by the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices .  
The European Union believes that a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable fissile material cut _ off treaty constitutes , after the CTBT , a major step towards the achievement of both the nuclear non _ proliferation and nuclear disarmament objectives envisaged in the NPT document on principles and objectives .  
First , the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee under agenda item 1 to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices ;  
India has also supported under Conference agenda item 1 the establishment of an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the special coordinator ( CD / 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Recalls the decision by the Conference on Disarmament2 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator3 and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
Intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on the early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 199532 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium on the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile material , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency as soon as practicable ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
For a considerable time , the European Union has steadfastly supported the commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a multilateral and internationally binding treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
It plays a vital role in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation and security through the operation of the nuclear safeguards system and in areas such as illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the management of surplus fissile material from dismantled weapons . 
In the Conference on Disarmament my country will advocate the prompt initiation of negotiations on a non-discriminatory , multilateral , effective and internationally verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices , the cut-off treaty , taking into account the objectives of non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament .  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
Welcomes the decision by the Conference on Disarmament32 to establish , under item 1 of its agenda entitled Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator 33 ] and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ;  
Emphasizing that , for the total elimination of nuclear weapons to be achieved , effective international cooperation to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons is vital and must be enhanced through , inter alia , the extension of international controls over all fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices ,  
The programme of action set out in that decision identified a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty , a convention banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , and the determined pursuit by the nuclear _ weapon States of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate aim of eliminating those weapons .  
As the Conference on Disarmament begins its work in the new year , I want to underline the strong commitment of the United States to prompt resumption of negotiations on the next key multilateral step in the nuclear disarmament process : a treaty to ban the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
Looking beyond START III negotiations , it seems clear to us that the prospects for negotiating deeper reductions would be enhanced if we have in place a dependable cap on fissile material for weapons , as well as confidence that the international community would detect illegal production.An FMCT also would help make nuclear arms reductions irreversible . 
If we truly want the Conference on Disarmament to live up to its responsibilities as the sole multilateral negotiating body on disarmament and international security , let us focus our work here on halting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons.Let us start today the negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty !  
It should provide for detailed accounts of the fissile material produced after the cut _ off date ; safeguards against the use of this material for nuclear _ weapon purposes ; timely and effective detention of any diversion of fissile material produced after the cut _ off date , as well as of any undeclared enrichment or reprocessing after that date .  
The agreement to begin negotiations designed to secure a treaty eliminating and prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices certainly constitutes a token of political will which is positive and constructive .  
It called for parallel negotiations on a phased programme for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and a comprehensive agreement banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices pursuant to paragraph 4 of the decision on Principles and objectives of the 1995 NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
The scope of such an international document should therefore cover all fissile material potentially usable in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices throughout the world , including the military stocks of these materials possessed by all States , on an equal footing .  
One of the principal characteristics of such an international instrument must be its non _ discriminatory nature in the sense that a uniform regime for strict international verification should be applied to all States and to all facilities capable of producing fissile material in all States without exception .  
On the other hand , such a treaty must be internationally and effectively verifiable , which means that the international instrument to be negotiated should be based on absolute transparency , which implies that all facilities anywhere in the world that are involved in the process of the production or storage of fissile material must be subject to a strict regime of control and inspection .  
My delegation likewise supports the re _ establishment of the ad hoc committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral , effectively and internationally verifiable treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , which will meet the goals of nuclear non _ proliferation and constitute an authentic disarmament measure .  
To re-establish , for the duration of its 1999 session , the Ad hoc Committee under item 1 of the agenda entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " to negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
The Conference establishes , under agenda item 1 entitled " Cessation of the nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament " , an ad hoc committee which shall negotiate , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator ( CD 1299 ) and the mandate contained therein , a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices . iii .  
We should also recommence immediately , in an ad hoc committee , negotiations on a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , as already agreed last year .  
Third and last , and in close connection with what I said earlier , I would like to place on record the support of my delegation for the early re _ establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee to negotiate a non _ discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty which would impose a prohibition on the production of fissile material for atomic bombs and other explosive nuclear devices , and for the early initiation of the negotiations .  
The intensive negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on and their early conclusion of a non-discriminatory , multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices , on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator in 1995 and the mandate contained therein , and , pending its entry into force , a moratorium of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons ;  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials , and calls for continued efforts by States that possess fissile material no longer required for defence purposes to make such material available for safeguards by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) as soon as practicable ;  
For several years the European Union has supported the initiation of negotiations on and the rapid conclusion of , a multilateral international treaty prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive nuclear devices .  
Equally important , the draft resolution draws attention to the importance of ongoing efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons and the need to ensure that excess fissile material is handled in a safe and effective way .  
An eventual convention on fissile material should be a concrete step forward in the nuclear disarmament process and should not be limited to being just another instrument of selective nonproliferation .  
Thus this single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum has been incapable of continuing negotiations on halting the production of fissile material for military purposes , known as cutoff , negotiations which were started in 1998 .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States had dismantled more than 13,000 warheads , a process which included the physical separation of the warheads conventional high explosive from its fissile material .  
His delegation looked forward to the resumption and early conclusion of negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a binding universal legal instrument banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices .  
These options could further include voluntary measures regarding weaponsusable fissile material related to military inventories with a view to achieving increased transparency , which could prepare the ground for ultimately agreed irreversible net reductions .  
The United Kingdom had published an initial report on past production of fissile material for defence purposes and was circulating a summary paper on its main conclusions and the role of such work in nuclear disarmament .  
Calls also for arrangements by all nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;  
In the context of active and ongoing negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty , the United States is prepared to agree to an overall work programme that calls for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament and another ad hoc committee that would conduct exploratory discussions on outer space issues .  
It is also extremely urgent that the Conference on Disarmament be reactivated and reach agreement on its programme of work , and that , as the sole multilateral negotiation body , it tackle the essential questions before it , such as the preparation of binding legal instruments on the prohibition of the production of fissile material and the prevention of an arms race in outer space .  
In the new millennium , other priorities include eliminating the so-called tactical nuclear weapons ; banning fissile materials for weapons purposes ; arresting the acquisition of advanced weapons of mass destruction ; maintaining the credibility of the non-proliferation regime ; and concluding an international convention against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons against the non-nuclear-weapon States .  
The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , D.C . , almost two months ago highlight the urgent need for an effective system of protection for fissile material and nuclear facilities , to combat illicit trafficking in such material and to strengthen the non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime through the immediate implementation of the 13 points agreed by consensus at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons .  
Welcomes the ongoing efforts in the dismantlement of nuclear weapons , notes the importance of the safe and effective management of the resultant fissile materials and calls for arrangements by all the nuclear-weapon States to place , as soon as practicable , the fissile material designated by each of them as no longer required for military purposes under the International Atomic Energy Agency or other relevant international verification and arrangements for the disposition of such material for peaceful purposes in order to ensure that such material remains permanently outside military programmes ;
