I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .

Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .

Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .

Reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations should reinforce its activities in order to facilitate such a dialogue ;  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .

Together with the agreements already signed , this Agreement seeks to create the conditions for genuine reconciliation among the people of Guatemala , based upon respect for human rights and the diversity of its peoples and on their shared determination to overcome the lack of social , economic and political opportunities , which undermines democratic coexistence and restricts the development of the nation ,  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .

Because democratic Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms , they are more likely to promote and respect the rule of law , respect individual and minority rights , cope effectively with social conflict , absorb migrant populations and respond to the needs of marginalized groups .  
Such a culture is built upon a societal consensus not about policy , but about the process and framework of democratic political life : that the will of the people is the basis of governmental authority ; that all individuals have a right to take part in government ; that there shall be periodic and genuine elections ; that power changes hands through popular suffrage rather than intimidation or force ; that political opponents and minorities have a right to express their views ; and that there can be loyal and legal opposition to the Government in power . 
It further states that " the will of the people shall be the basis of authority of government " , and that " this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures " . 7 It also declares the right to equality before the law , to freedom of opinion and expression , and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association . 
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " .

Thirdly , since the draft Convention sets out a framework regime that lays down general rules intended to promote equitable and reasonable cooperation between downstream and upstream States in the use of international watercourses , and in the hope that its implementation will make a genuine contribution to the progressive development of international law , the Slovak Republic is in a position to vote in favour of the draft framework Convention .

Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
Such a forum and other appropriate instruments might be based on a framework convention containing flexible rules whose primary objective is to create the appropriate dynamics aimed at the implementation and ongoing consolidation of an international economic environment leading to the exercise by all nations of the right to development and to genuine international peace and security .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .

It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .

The Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 122 of 20 December 1995 , reaffirmed that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .

On the contrary , genuine peace must be based on respect for the rule of law , on the acceptance of the solidarity and interdependence of all States and on the common desire to move dynamically forward towards the solution of the critical problems of dire poverty , disease , unemployment , illiteracy and economic and social inequality among peoples and nations .

With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .

This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .

All the Movement ' s conferences have addressed it with the utmost gravity , because the Movement is fully aware that , despite international developments and the vast increase in the number of States Members of the United Nations , those States do not enjoy genuine representation commensurate with their number , international influence and desire to express their legitimate interests .

The European Union considers that the presidential elections scheduled for 17 December should reinforce the achievements already made and should provide an example of harmony and tolerance , so that the entire population of Haiti can attain genuine national reconciliation and lay the foundations for the political , economic and social reconstruction of their country .  
The establishment of a conceptual link between disarmament and development by giving an impetus to more accelerated progress on the issues of global development will strengthen the roots of international peace and security and preserve the spirit of understanding , constructive cooperation and genuine political goodwill which are essential for the building of a better and more secure world . 
In conclusion , Nigeria would like to see the First Committee at this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly motivated by the desire for cooperation in finding genuine and lasting solutions to those problems that continue to confront us in the area of disarmament in the remaining part of this twentieth century , in order to bequeath to the next generation in the twenty-first century a world which is indeed free of these weapons of mass destruction . 
Secondly , and as a result , all Member States share a common interest in avoiding nuclear war and in achieving nuclear disarmament , and must therefore in future increase their efforts bilateral , regional and global on the basis of negotiations conducted in a broad spirit of genuine cooperation and good faith so as to strengthen the existing mechanisms for nuclear disarmament and to agree on new procedures for achieving it . 
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
What is worse , the international community will continue to send a negative signal vis - - vis the United Nations , that of a lack of genuine commitment to the ideals and principles that inspired its creation half a century ago .  
A fundamental contradiction in the practice of sanctions is that when they are introduced the main foundation is the interest of the international community , but when they are lifted the dominant factor is national interests - sometimes not even genuine ones - on the part of individual States .  
Also reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations system should play a central role in facilitating such a dialogue ;  
It also confirms our belief in how much can be accomplished through multilateral action if the mandates set by the Council are achievable , the time-frames remain realistic , our approach is flexible and the commitment to peace among the parties involved is genuine .  
Although there were guard posts at all gates and entry into the compound was limited to those who either held a regular pass or were given temporary passes , bogus passes , which were indistinguishable from the genuine ones , could easily be bought at the Bakara market of the city .  
People living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and participation in all aspects of political , economic and social life , and in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them and thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development .  
The longer this situation continues , the more likely it is that we will be faced with a genuine structural public-service problem leading to inefficient use of national human capacities and a waste of resources .  
We came to this Summit , rightly called the " People 's Summit " , convinced that the only genuine path towards a new civilization must be one centred on the human person , on the vigour of human dignity and the freedom of the human spirit , and on the inalienable right of the individual to live a full life guaranteed by the existence of universal social justice .  
The real challenge in the area of reforming the social sector is to transcend the current limitations of its organizations , which are isolated , inflexible , overly centralized , hostile to genuine participation , unwilling to address the problems created by power struggles , reluctant to cooperate , of insufficient importance in the State apparatus and lacking in professional career paths for managers and in managers with specialized training in the social sphere .  
It urges genuine cooperation among all States in the framework of international legitimacy so that the necessary measures may be taken to prevent and combat terrorism and eliminate its causes , and it calls for the formulation of internationally acceptable criteria to differentiate clearly between terrorism , which must be condemned and opposed , and national struggle against foreign occupation , which must be protected and supported .  
NULLWe note with satisfaction that today , now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the " cold war " has ended , new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element . 
During the preceding six years his country had irreversibly embarked on the road to democracy , the rule of law and the protection of universal human rights and it attached the utmost importance to matters relating to minorities , a basic prerequisite for building a genuine democracy that would contribute to regional and international security and cooperation .  
Governments in such regions can do much to remedy intrinsic factors that contribute to that unattractiveness but they will need more help to enable them to meet the financial requirements of sustainable development , for which genuine new and innovative sources will be required , including sources in the developed world .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Accordingly , full implementation and realization of the Declaration calls for a genuine democratization of international economic and political relations , a process that will negate the adverse consequences of the current process of globalization and foster a new climate of solidarity and international cooperation , in keeping with the growing interdependence observed world wide .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Reaffirms that the dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations should reinforce its activities in order to facilitate such a dialogue ;

Reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations should reinforce its activities in order to facilitate such a dialogue ;  
that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
In conclusion , while looking forward to the achievement of a genuine , permanent and peaceful settlement to the Arab-Israeli conflict , my Government is hopeful that the international community will take a firm stand against the Israeli military aggression in the area .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .  
With the new global changes , with our recent adoption of the CTBT , with rising optimism regarding the Conference on Disarmament , with what can be perceived as a genuine desire for peace , and with more meaningful international collaboration in the areas of economic cooperation and development , there is some hope for achieving lasting peace and security in our world .  
We are convinced that through prudent management of our very limited resources , a willingness on the part of our people to work hard and , on our part , clear political leadership and virtuously inspired guidance all enhanced by the support of friendly Governments and donor agencies we shall , in due course , place our country on a sound path towards genuine growth .  
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
The Government has formulated specific and concrete plans aimed at modernizing the productive structures of the country , in order to legitimize a new economic plan through genuine proposals for social development , based on the concept of social solidarity and good governance .  
I am pleased to say that , through decisive action rather than words , we have made genuine strides in enlarging our dialogue and cooperation with friendly nations worldwide , developed and developing alike .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
This is because their genuine efforts to achieve a just and lasting peace in the region have in recent months met with grave and hostile incidents provoked by the occupying Power with an aggressive and dangerous policy that threatens the course of the peace process in the region .  It is common knowledge that all of this is possible thanks to the support Israel continues to receive from the United States , which has never concealed its determination to veto in the Security Council any resolution that contains firm statements against Israel 's conduct in the Middle East .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
The entire programme for the Decade should be aimed at a genuine democratization of international relations based on law through the creation of an atmosphere in which all States observed such fundamental principles as respect for the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of States , inviolability of borders , peaceful settlement of international disputes and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .  It was in that spirit that his delegation supported the appeal for new human and financial resources launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
Reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations should reinforce its activities in order to facilitate such a dialogue ;  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
That process is time-consuming , expensive and delicate , but such a deliberative process is the only hope for genuine development , which in turn depends upon talented , skilled and sensitive public administrators for implementation . 
" Model guns " are toy guns made of metal that have forms similar to genuine handguns and that can be made into real guns .  In this context , " clean controlled delivery " involves secret replacement of an illegal handgun with a legal substitute .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
Noticing that the 14-million eligible voters among the 21.3-million Republic of China citizens living in Taiwan , Penghu ( Pescadores ) , Kinmen ( Quemoy ) and Matsu area have , through universal , equal and direct suffrage and secret balloting , elected their first popularly elected president on 23 March 1996 as their genuine representative in the international community ,  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
One delegation expressed the view that as globalization and interdependence in the world economy continued to grow , an historic opportunity had arisen for constructive dialogue for the promotion of international cooperation for development , based on the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
With regard to the proceedings of the National Convention , the main criticisms which have been variously made have centred around , first , the composition of the delegates and the absence of genuine and proper representation of members returned at the general elections ; second , the restrictions imposed upon the delegates and the restrictive procedures which are required to be followed ; and third , the restricted opportunity for meaningful discussion , including the absence of free debate and exchange of ideas .  
They stressed that the solution to the debt problem must go much further than the establishment of transitory relief measures and be based on a genuine joint effort between debtors and creditors without selectivity , taking into account all the dimensions of the problem and ensuring a net transfer of financial resources to indebted countries .  
Together with the agreements already signed , this Agreement seeks to create the conditions for genuine reconciliation among the people of Guatemala , based upon respect for human rights and the diversity of its peoples and on their shared determination to overcome the lack of social , economic and political opportunities , which undermines democratic coexistence and restricts the development of the nation ,  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .  
Reaffirms the need to encourage constructive dialogue and partnership based on mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development ;  
The draft resolution demonstrated the international community 's decision to recognize that , at a time of increasing interdependence , the promotion of development called for a constructive dialogue based on mutual interests and benefits , shared responsibility and genuine interdependence .  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
In conclusion , while emphasizing our consistent and principled positions , we affirm our readiness to coordinate and cooperate with other peace-loving States , as well as with the relevant international organizations , for the realization of a real and genuine peace based on the restoration of the inalienable rights of the Palestinians .  
Reaffirms the need to encourage constructive dialogue and partnership based on mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development ;  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;

Because democratic Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms , they are more likely to promote and respect the rule of law , respect individual and minority rights , cope effectively with social conflict , absorb migrant populations and respond to the needs of marginalized groups .  
Such a culture is built upon a societal consensus not about policy , but about the process and framework of democratic political life : that the will of the people is the basis of governmental authority ; that all individuals have a right to take part in government ; that there shall be periodic and genuine elections ; that power changes hands through popular suffrage rather than intimidation or force ; that political opponents and minorities have a right to express their views ; and that there can be loyal and legal opposition to the Government in power . 
It further states that " the will of the people shall be the basis of authority of government " , and that " this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures " . 7 It also declares the right to equality before the law , to freedom of opinion and expression , and to freedom of peaceful assembly and association . 
8 December 1988 , reaffirming that the will of the people , expressed in periodic and genuine elections , shall be the basis of authority of government , the General Assembly stressed that , " as a matter of practical experience , the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country is a crucial factor in the effective enjoyment of a wide range of other human rights and fundamental freedoms , embracing political , economic , social , and cultural rights " . 
The establishment of an international criminal court would be a monumental advance , affording , at last , genuine international jurisdictional protection to some of the world 's major legal achievements . 
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
Thirdly , since the draft Convention sets out a framework regime that lays down general rules intended to promote equitable and reasonable cooperation between downstream and upstream States in the use of international watercourses , and in the hope that its implementation will make a genuine contribution to the progressive development of international law , the Slovak Republic is in a position to vote in favour of the draft framework Convention .  
To complement our own efforts at the national , subregional and regional levels , no effort will be spared to develop and enhance cooperation with all traditional development partners as well as new friends in conformity with the underlying principles of the Gambia 's foreign policy objectives , which are predicated on openness , peaceful coexistence , genuine respect for each other 's point of view and full equality in international intercourse with all countries .  
However , at the end of the day , all of us who are democratizing agree that basic fundamentals must be met , among them the promotion of the existence of representative government elected by the majority of the population through secret ballot , in regular periodic and genuine elections , as well as the promotion of party competition , an independent judiciary , guarantees of fundamental human rights and individual freedoms , transparency and accountability under the rule of law , a free and independent press and the growth of civil society .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
Such a forum and other appropriate instruments might be based on a framework convention containing flexible rules whose primary objective is to create the appropriate dynamics aimed at the implementation and ongoing consolidation of an international economic environment leading to the exercise by all nations of the right to development and to genuine international peace and security .  
The independent expert has said that only the complete and public revelation of the truth would make it possible to satisfy the basic requirements of the principles of justice and create the conditions essential to a genuine and effective process of transition and national reconciliation .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
It also has a negative impact on dedicated staff members who , in a genuine effort to fulfil all mandates , have to spread themselves too thinly , are unable to stay in touch with their fields of expertise and find themselves in a spiral of constant deadlines and diminishing results .  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .  
As on previous occasions , the Polish delegation expresses its strong belief that only genuine national reconciliation and respect for the interests of all ethnic and religious population groups in Afghanistan , as well as the long-standing tradition of Afghan statehood , can provide a true basis for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .  
The Convention envisages that , to be effective , this equality must be achieved within the framework of a political system in which each citizen enjoys the right to vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections held on the basis of universal suffrage and by secret ballot , in such a way as to guarantee the free expression of the will of the electorate , as provided for under international human rights instruments , such as article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
It is incumbent upon that organization to show to the international community , through practical , credible and trustworthy deeds , that it has indeed demilitarized , that it no longer claims and controls any portion of the country 's territory , that its radio broadcasting system is complying with Angola 's laws , and that it has truly become a genuine political party . 
It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
Moreover , issues , including environmental issues , that bear on the international economic environment can be approached effectively only through a constructive dialogue and genuine partnership on the basis of mutuality of interests and benefits , taking into account that , in view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation , States have common but differentiated responsibilities . 
According to the report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ( A / 51 / 301 ) , such manifestations had profound and complex historical , political , social , economic and even religious causes which should be removed by taking measures to achieve genuine equality , human rights and fundamental freedoms among all racial or ethnic groups .  
Therefore , with a view to contributing to international peace by tackling development issues in close cooperation with the United Nations , Japan has been taking the initiative for a new development strategy , which is to be based on the firm recognition of ownership of the countries involved , as well as a genuine partnership between them and industrialized countries .  
The Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 122 of 20 December 1995 , reaffirmed that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
Sustained pursuit of negotiation , bilateral and multilateral , is indispensable in order to achieve the goal of genuine and complete disarmament , as well as to completely eliminate the massive stockpiles of existing nuclear arsenals .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Also reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development and for improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations system should play a central role in strengthening such a dialogue ;  
The fact that the texts bearing on procedural matters contained fewer alternatives and brackets indicated that decisions were easier where political considerations were not so prominent , but also that the harmonization of elements of civil law and common law systems was not insuperable when there was a genuine will to go forward .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
On the contrary , genuine peace must be based on respect for the rule of law , on the acceptance of the solidarity and interdependence of all States and on the common desire to move dynamically forward towards the solution of the critical problems of dire poverty , disease , unemployment , illiteracy and economic and social inequality among peoples and nations .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
Special emphasis is being put on and we have started work towards the reorganization of the army , with the objective of gradually having a smaller , more efficient and professional force under strict civilian control , in conformity with all standards of modern armies , capable of performing its functions properly and of being a genuine partner in partnership activities .  
With respect to the question of the Nile waters , which affects Ethiopia directly and regarding which there has been no effective cooperation among the riparians , we wish to call on those involved to commit themselves to real and genuine regional cooperation which is based on a win-win perspective , ensuring outcomes that are fair , equitable and just .  
It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
As regards debt , a genuine obstacle to development for many countries of the South , my delegation supports any initiative aimed at finding effective , fair , lasting and development-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign debt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries .  
In concluding , let me say that while Indonesia will continue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level to translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development into genuine social progress , we will also continue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable position for the developing countries within the international community .  
This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
Thus , we have taken the first step in a broad and complex process that can bring us closer to the vision of a Central American Union , with the ultimate goal of producing the concrete results sought by our populations : overcoming poverty , creating opportunities , increasing the number of jobs , activating our production capacity , increasing our competitiveness , equitable and unified participation in the benefits of development , genuine democratization , equitable access to an efficient system of justice and the legitimate enjoyment of peaceful coexistence .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
In the first case , the two main groups can be differentiated by appearance , as the Tutsi are long , whereas the Hutu are short ; the Tutsi are handsome , genuine black _ skinned Europeans , while the Hutu are ugly , genuine Negroes .  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
It is therefore clear that if there is to be genuine improvement in the disturbing situation in the former Sectors , efforts by both international and local organizations to promote confidence and reconciliation will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future .  1 International observers had estimated the total number of killings which had taken place in the former Sectors in circumstances unrelated to the military actions of August 1995 to be at least 120 ( see S / 1995 / 1051 ) .  
In resolution 42 / 169 of 11 December 1987 , the General Assembly , " convinced that concerted international action for the reduction of natural disasters over the course of the 1990s would give genuine impetus to a series of concrete measures " decided to designate the 1990s as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction .  
The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .
