Among the nuclei , the diameters of the 11 larger ones range from 2 to 4 kilometers .  The explosion energy caused by these collisions will reach as high as 10-trillion tons of TNT dynamite , and equivalent to the explosive power of 500-million atomic bombs similar to those dropped on Hiroshima . A colossal fireball and soaring mushroom cloud may be formed in Jupiter 's atmosphere whose projectiles would be thrown to a height of several thousand kilometers .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
New actors and actresses must be diligent , assiduous , modest and prudent .  They must learn from the artistic morality and styles of old and famous actors and actresses in order to make larger steps on the road of art and to become mature faster .  
So , improving the quality of creative works and offering a larger quantity of excellent works involving producers ' great efforts is the most important task among important tasks of the military 's literary and artistic work in the future period .  
If we combine requirements and possibilities in our considerations , we discover that our army and those of developed Western countries show remarkable differences .  Our army 's equipment development has been carried out in a larger context , ensuring that economic development is the center , and has developed under an increasingly constrained situation .  National conditions , military conditions , and the requirements of the " three steps forward " strategy have all determined that our army must pursue equipment development in strides .  
From this , our army 's development , based on support , has proceeded only on a shrunken scale , weakening the military 's function in managing society ; the larger development trend has already gradually realized self-support capabilities integrated with socialized support .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
The Clinton administration proposed a limited defense system which was confined to a land-based deployment .  According to the plan , a system composed of 100 interceptors would be built inside the country which was capable of dealing with about 20-30 attacking ballistic missiles .  There was no plan to build up a system of a larger scale .  
making major progress in establishing the modern corporate system for state-owned enterprises , making our social security system more perfect , making substantive strides in perfecting the socialist market economic system , and participating in international economic cooperation and competition in a larger scope and to a deeper degree ;  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
In its editorial entitled " Serious Consequences of US Arms Sales to Taiwan , " Wen Wei Po pointed out that it is both wrong and dangerous for the United States to be continuously selling arms and equipment to Taiwan , especially when the weapons sold are more and more sophisticated and the sums involved are larger and larger .  
This year , the Fortune Global Forum in Hong Kong is held on a larger scale with more than 700 people from China and other countries attending the meeting , including the chairman , presidents , chief executive officers of more than 200 larger foreign enterprises and more than 150 Hong Kong enterprises , responsible people from more than 60 Chinese mainland enterprises , and more than 20 leaders of relevant ministries and state commissions of China and some provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities of China .  
Luo Gan pointed out : Since the national conference on public order work was held in April , localities have attached great importance to and conscientiously implemented the important speech of General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the spirit of the conference , taken swift actions and struck severe blows at Mafia-style criminal gangs in larger numbers , catching a great number of felons in the net of justice .  The masses of the people clapped and cheered at all these achievements .  
The Chinese government encourages foreign investors , especially multinational corporations , to invest and run fund - and technology-intensive projects ; to initiate a larger number of advanced technology-related projects ; and to invest in auxiliary and coordinative projects as well as projects aimed to earn foreign currency through exports , including electromechanical products , the components and parts industry , and raw materials .  
In particular , the law enforcement capabilities at the grassroots level should be enhanced .  While raising the quality of personnel , it is also necessary to strengthen the development of the information systems of government regulatory bodies and upgrade their equipment .  It is necessary to build larger platforms to achieve information sharing between departments .  
For the sake of ensuring the unity of our motherland , the Chinese armed forces are perfectly capable of monitoring fixed and moving targets along the southeastern coast and nearby waters , to spot , track , and identify medium-sized and larger military vessels .  They are capable of anytime , all-weather monitoring of large warships ( mainly aircraft carriers ) .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable Renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system .  If the value of Japanese yen plummets and the US dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than Renminbi itself .

For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
Wang Shucheng , minister of water resources , indicated that the contradictions between shortage of water resources and accelerated economic development have become increasingly larger over the past few years .  Besides the shortage of water for agricultural and industrial production and domestic use , the drought has directly worsened the ecological environment .  
Their common interests have determined that the area of cooperation between China and the United States will become larger and larger .  A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
Since early June , the larger part north of the Huang He has experienced a hot weather with hardly any rain .  During this period , high temperatures lasted for several consecutive days in northwest China , north China , northeast China , as well as the Huang He and Huai He regions , worsening the drought that began to break out in north and northwest China in the spring of this year and causing the drought in the western part of northeast China to drastically deteriorate .  
In the long run , the RMB will move from a larger fluctuation range to floating freely , and will become freely convertible in the end ; and this can be said a gradual process of relaxing foreign exchange controls .  If such a process can be materialized in an appropriate way , the RMB can be turned into an international currency at the cost of the minimum shock .  
It has been reported that the demand of the general public for an early close of the case is increasingly building up .  At the Xiamen City People 's Congress session , which was held not long ago , a deputy pointed out : So long as the case is not closed , instability factors will loom larger and larger in society .  This will seriously disrupt Xiamen 's economic and social life and injure Xiamen 's reputation at home and overseas .  
We must actively implement the " outward bound " strategy of opening up , encourage domestic industries with competitive edge and larger production capacities to transfer their operations to developing countries , and set up overseas bases for processing trade and resource development .  We must further relax control on small SOEs and invigorate them ;  
make major progress in setting up the modern enterprise system in state-owned enterprises and establishing a relatively sound social security system , make substantial progress in improving the socialist market economic system , and participate in international economic cooperation and competition on a larger scope and to a deeper extent ;  
The police estimated that after the crackdowns in the fourth quarter of this year and in the first half of next year , they should be able to eliminate some of the larger local triads , fully curb the activities of foreign triads in the mainland , and bring about an obvious improvement in public order in the coastal areas .  
" The major measures mainly include adding eight noisy occupations to the existing list of 17 specified noisy occupations for which compensation is payable so as to enable a larger number of claimants to become eligible to compensation , and waiving the requirement for the cost of hearing test and medical examination , " he said , noting that some 8,900 people are employed under the proposed eight occupations .  
All election advertisements must be marked with serial numbers except a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or by electronic means , and balloons .  
To meet this objective , we may need to consider steering away from the past approach in which urban renewal had been conducted in a piecemeal manner .  Instead , we will plan urban renewal and rehabilitation more comprehensively for larger areas , with a view to more effectively restructuring and re-planning the old urban areas , re-designing a more effective and environmentally friendly transport and road network , replacing incompatible land uses , adding open space , and designing buildings which meet the demands of modern living .  
* All election advertisements must be marked with serial numbers starting from " one " .  Printed materials on a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size and bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or transmitted by electronic means , balloons , T-shirts , caps , badges and carrier bags are exempted from this requirement .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman observed that , comparing August with July 1999 , the larger year-on-year decreases in the CPIs were largely attributable to a further marked decline in their private housing rental component , as the earlier considerable declines in market rentals filtered through . 
Among them , the community , social and personal services sector recorded relatively larger growth in employment , followed by financing , insurance , real estate and business services sector .  Yet employment of manual workers at construction sites and employment in the manufacturing sector continued to show marked decreases .  
For cases involving mains exceeding 600 mm in diameter , as the suspension of water supply will affect a larger area and cause inconvenience to a greater number of population , careful consideration and special arrangements are required for closing the valves and providing alternative supply .  It is therefore inappropriate to set a rigid standard for the processing time of such cases .  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
There was an overwhelming response from singleton applicants .  According to the then prevailing policy , they could choose to buy a Small Flat up to 28 square metres saleable in their normal turn of flat selection , or purchase a larger HOS flat up to 51 square metres saleable when all family households have completed their flat selection .  
The slightly larger year-on-year decline in the Composite CPI in May than in April was mainly attributable to accelerated decreases in the prices of some food items especially those of fresh fruits and salt water fish amidst an abundant supply , which more than offset the effect of reduced declines in the charges of certain miscellaneous services such as cinema entertainment and long distance calls .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
It was reported that on 5th of this month , a surgeon of the Prince of Wales Hospital was suspended from clinical duties with immediate effect by the Chief of Service of the Department of Surgery , allegedly because he had been impolite to his superior .  Subsequently , a laparoscopic operation scheduled to be performed by the surgeon had to be replaced by an open surgery , which would inflict larger wounds on the patient , performed by other surgeons .  
( b ) Computer wastes from commercial and industrial sources normally come in larger quantities .  They have to be collected by licensed collectors as required by the Waste Disposal Ordinance to ensure that the heavy metals contained therein will not pollute the environment during transportation .  
The Committee conducts annual reviews on relevant guidelines and examination measures and submits reports to the School Examinations Board for approval .  It also examines , with reference to the relevant guidelines , the recommendations put forward by the Secretariat on special arrangements for individual candidates , such as extended examination time and examination papers printed in larger font size or braille .  
The larger year-on-year decrease in the Composite CPI in August 2001 than in July 2001 was mainly attributable to a fall in the prices of basic foodstuffs .  In particular , the prices of fresh vegetables eased back distinctly in August , from a relatively high level in July as supply was disrupted by the rainy weather .  
In view of the prevailing market conditions and to allow the market greater flexibility , we have put the larger , more valuable sites in the current financial year 's Application List and have arranged for the smaller private housing sites to be sold in the scheduled land auctions .  
In view of the economic situation , the Housing Authority has not adjusted its public housing rents since 1998 .  The rents for many flats are still at 1995 levels .  Arising from other factors such as the sale and redevelopment of housing estates and the allocation of larger flats , the current median rent-to-income ratio is above 10% .  However , to the extent that this phenomenon has arisen not as a direct consequence of rental adjustments , the Housing Authority has not broken the law .  
First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

Overall , a combined visible and invisible trade surplus of $ 34.1 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 , larger than that of $ 20.7 billion in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Within the GDP deflator , the domestic demand deflator had an enlarged year-on-year decline of 4.4% in the third quarter of 2002 .  This was attributable to a larger fall in the price deflators for private consumption expenditure , for gross domestic fixed capital formation , and for government consumption expenditure .  
While many larger foreign enterprises have advantages in capital , human and technical resources , professional knowledge , experience in project management and implementation , and international connection , Hong Kong enterprises also enjoy unique strengths in developing the telecommunications and IT markets in the Mainland . 
They will be complemented by a larger , vehicle-free public square / piazza , which will be connected to a tourist corridor leading from the cable car terminal in the northwest and the public transport terminal in the west . 
To make maximum use of the materials and lands has always been the ultimate goal in our economic reconstruction . It is essential , at this crucial hour , to develop a larger and better labor force and to enhance skills to meet the demands of working capital and of more intensive industrial needs .  
Market trends in Europe and the U . S . this year show that older people are buying ceramic dolls to pass on to the younger generation . International demand for gift items , steadily increasing apace of world population growth and improved living standards , has led to the development of worldwide gift industries . Advanced nations often phase out their production of small gifts in favor of larger , technical and high profit items .  
Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential . In addition , the specter of rising labor costs and tougher international copyright and trademark laws have further intensified the need for local manufacturers to do their own industrial design , marketed under their own labels .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
One can only be accepted by the association governing hawk-raising if the bird is not only alive after 3-5 years , but still has glossy feathers , is highly spirited , and has not been in any way " maltreated . " Only then is one considered qualified to get permission to raise other varieties which are larger or harder to handle .  
Chen Hui-sheng says that there are some people raising huge eagles or vultures smuggled in from abroad . Yet Taiwan 's suburbs lack rabbits or foxes or other larger types of prey . " It 's like bombing a chicken with napalm , " says the well-informed Chen . Wide-wingspread falcons are extremely fast , and require a huge amount of space , and are completely unsuitable for mountainous Taiwan .  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
The tradition of " eight treasures " Since the Chou Dynasty the Chinese have developed a roster of the " eight most excellent treasures , " dishes which satisfy delicate and exquisite tastes . Favored delicacies have differed from era to era , such as bear paws , swiftlet nests , monkey brains , ape lips and camel humps . Because the number of choice dishes has grown larger and larger , the list has been more precisely divided into four categories of " eight treasures " : mammals , seafood , poultry , and vegetables .  
Insecurity follows like a shadowIt is ironic that larger factories often choose to close or move simply because they are large and successful : in order to protect the corporate image , they have to observe the Labor Standards Law and environmental regulations , so they have high operating costs ; also large enterprises occupy much larger - - and more valuable - - amounts of land .  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man . " The powerful and moving brushstrokes in these large works that need no detailed commentary completely convey his forthright personality as well as the incomparable power of nature .  
Chen Yi-ming points out that male genitalia are less likely to develop sores , and the mucus membranes in female sexual organs have a larger number of monocytes that are receptive to viruses . In addition , seminal fluid contains more viruses than vaginal fluid . For these reasons , women are more easily infected by men than vice versa .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
Playboy 's Lolita Hu notes that given its power to reach larger and wider audiences , the television medium is subject to greater restriction than magazines . Consequently , Taiwan 's TV programs are still unsure how to present comprehensive attitudes toward the body . Meanwhile , the permissible degree of bodily exposure is similarly narrower , at most merely reflecting trends in society .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel . The situation has been especially serious in the mass media . In all areas of media , including TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines , the market is saturated , and few people are leaving their jobs .  
There are also a number of architectural elements in the exhibit , including banisters , column capitals , tiles , and flagstones from the king 's palace . These items have all just been excavated in the past five years , and are highly significant finds as they come from the oldest royal palace ever discovered in China . The exhibit also reproduces a beautiful stream paved with small , closely packed dark-gray pebbles interspersed with larger yellowish pebbles .  
Thanks to this explanation and analysis , readers can understand everything from the works of Shakespeare to the lives of Taiwan 's aborigines , from the views of the Dalai Lama , to those of the overseas Chinese singing star Lee-hom Wang . There is international news and also domestic news . Some of it 's serious , and some of it 's trendy . These English-instruction magazines attest to the fact that Taiwanese appetites for information are getting larger and increasingly varied !  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
Every 11 years , when the solar magnetic field goes into overdrive , in some areas of the sun 's surface the temperature sinks to 4000oC , so that these areas look darker in color than the surrounding photosphere . Seen from the earth they appear as small dark spots on the face of the sun , but in fact a single sunspot may be many times larger than the total surface area of the earth .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
They range from familiar staples such as acupuncture , moxibustion , Chinese herbal medicine , qigong and shiatsu , to more exotic-sounding varieties such as homeopathy , magnetic healing and energetic medicine . ( Homeopathy is a traditional European treatment method in which the practitioner first diagnoses the patient 's symptoms , then prescribes tiny doses of drugs that in larger quantities would elicit the same symptoms . The drug 's affinity for the disease boosts the body 's own defense mechanisms . This is similar to the Chinese principle of " fighting poison with poison . " )  
Moreover , there is national financial distress with the government deficit exceeding NT $ 3 trillion . If loans are raised to hire unemployed workers , then a balanced budget will not be attainable within the foreseeable future . This bill would also dampen the improving economy and delay financial reform efforts , and the misallocation of resources would influence larger government projects , and be detrimental to long-term economic growth .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless . By contrast , at present only around 40-50 larger sets of photovoltaic panels are installed in Taiwan to generate electricity from the sun 's rays . On public land and buildings , to date the MOEA has completed demonstration systems in only a few locations including the Presidential Palace and the Yushan meteorological observatory . There is also little sign of enthusiasm for installations on ordinary residential buildings .  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
Although a larger flow of external funding and assistance to human settlements development is a desirable outcome , sustainability can only be achieved in the medium and long term by using scarce external resources in a strategic and catalytic way .  
However , the programme approach may still be pursued if the individual projects are conceived as catalytic elements for larger national programmes , thoroughly designed , supported also by either domestic resources or nonUnited Nations donors .  
It was generally realized that the only viable socioeconomic system was one that respected the freedom of the individual and focused on promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom .  
However , new refugees continued to arrive from southern Iraq and , unless effective preventive policies were pursued , a larger refugee inflow could be recorded in the months ahead .  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
In this wider breakthrough of understanding in the universe , let us be thankful that on this tiny planet there is on the East River in New York a piece of land where people meet to discuss problems some no bigger than an ant-hill and some larger thankful that somewhere there is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu where lilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes !  
This culture , in the larger , anthropological sense , included not only artistic expression and common languages and vernacular languages , but also the ways of life , social organization and technology that arise from the creativity , ability to adapt and intelligence that men and women have had accumulated over time across the five continents . 
Pluralism is essential to the transition to a democratic government , but in a larger sense encompassing periodic elections , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
We constantly acknowledge that we now live in an era in which interconnected economic and social issues have assumed larger prominence on the international agenda , in which the call for cooperation across State boundaries to address these urgencies has intensified , and in which , as a result of our global interdependence , the need for vital , responsive and effective international institutions to address new demands is all the more imperative .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
The research also concluded that capital requirements of the new technologies were much larger than that for previous vintages of equipment which increases the level of plant output necessary to reduce unit costs , and , that while product knowledge and marketing requirements had increased with the new technologies , there had also been a reduction in the need for administrative and managerial functions and as a result no firm judgement could be made regarding changes in firm scale . 
In view of the modest number of replies received and the diverse nature of the information communicated , the Special Rapporteur decided to reproduce in his report the texts according to country rather than present an analytical summary according to subject , assuming that a larger number of Governments would submit more complete and more precise information .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
As the Commissioner-General has pointed out , the parties to this process and the major donors to the Agency have asked UNRWA not only to maintain its existing services throughout its area of operations during the interim period , but to play a larger role in helping to effect improvements in the social and economic spheres in which the Agency has acquired a special expertise .  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .

It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
The observed trend of a larger increase in minimum than in maximum temperatures is apparently linked to associated increases in low clouds and aerosols and to the enhanced greenhouse effect .  
Also , while trying to reconstruct their economy and lay the foundations for their future State , the Palestinians were aware of the need for eventual integration into a larger economic context and developing mutually beneficial ties with countries of the Middle East , North Africa and the Mediterranean basin .  
It is also increasingly recognized by disaster-prone country authorities and by many donors that a larger proportion of international assistance should be focused on addressing the root causes of disaster , through suitably adapted prevention and preparedness programmes which maximize the mobilization of national and especially local community resources , drawing upon the skills and expertise of all relevant regional and international agencies .  
The introduction of the second cycle of basic education ( seventh , eighth and ninth years ) and the admission to it of a larger number of pupils may lead to an increase in the numbers failing to complete the course unless teaching methods and curricula are altered .  
It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
The administrative component of UNMOT would be strengthened to support the larger Mission , as would its communications , road and air transport and other facilities , bearing in mind the mountainous terrain and the bad state of repair of the roads , many of which are cut off as a result of damage or will be impassable for several months in winter .  
However , foreign direct investment in developing countries , as well as the recent parallel surge in international portfolio investment , has been concentrated in the more advanced economies , the larger economies and those with high rates of economic growth .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
At the same time , these anti-poverty strategies are to be defined and implemented in the larger context of creating an environment that encourages and supports equitable , broad-based economic growth and social development at both the national and international levels .  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
For Malaysia , as a developing country , economic , social and cultural rights , articulated through the larger framework of the right to development , are as important as civil and political rights .  
Another area of greatest need is the development of small satellite technology , which has strong potential for offering a larger number of countries affordable access to space through the rapid development of fully integrated national space programmes .  
The variables were standardized and equal weights assigned to them in the computation of the composite vulnerability index , which confirmed that small island developing States were generally more vulnerable than larger countries . 
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
In the later case , a central , larger hub station connected via the space segment to the various remote sites , which were equipped with small , simple and relatively cheap satellite antennas .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
High growth of gross national product ( GNP ) or the reduction of inflation does not lead to development unless it is accompanied by changes in the distribution of income , enabling a larger portion of the population to realize their economic , social and cultural rights .  
That figure , which was much lower than in any of the previous three years , could be attributed to two main factors : first , the major contributor had made a significantly larger regular budget payment during the final quarter of 1998 than in previous years , with less being deferred for payment in the year ; and , second , a record 117 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full by the end of 1998 , a continued upward trend which the Secretary-General wished to acknowledge .  
Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres . 
Special development situations require an integrated approach to security and development , one that entails programmes set in a time-frame larger than three years and that has as an integral part , from the outset of the peace-building process , social and community development programmes designed to meet the basic needs of the population .  
New procedures enabling the delivery of debt relief more rapidly and to a larger group of beneficiaries will indeed be essential for solving the debt overhang problems of the poor , heavily indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; and special arrangements are required for those emerging from civil war and strife and presenting exceptional economic rehabilitation assistance needs .  
In view of the continuous expansion of the functions and responsibilities of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section of the Secretariat to meet the demand of a growing number of applications for consultative status as well as the diverse , more substantive demands of a larger and more active non-governmental organizations community , the Committee suggested , at its resumed 1998 session , that this item remain in the agenda of the Committee .  
Once a junior company has identified a commercial deposit and carried out initial development work , the deposit is usually sold to larger corporations with better financial and technical resources .  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
The combined gross national product of the aggressors is 1,163 times that of the victim , their population 77 times larger , their territory 226 times bigger , their troops 43 times more numerous .  The Serb people 's resistance has been heroic , but at what a cost : thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded , terrible deprivation , a country in ruins , children traumatized for life by the bombing .  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
These include reorganization of divisions ; formal procedures for setting priorities and monitoring at regular monthly meetings with clients ; establishing a continuing legal education programme for its staff to keep abreast of developments in , for example , the financing , insurance , copyright and trademark and arbitration fields ; playing a larger role in the selection and training of legal officers for peacekeeping missions and establishment of a time-keeping system .

We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , . . . to establish conditions under which justice . . . can be maintained , and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom , . . . have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims .  
In the area of the mobilization of external resources for development , the challenges ahead include the following : mobilizing enhanced and more stable sources of international investment flows towards a larger number of recipient developing countries ; strengthening international cooperation aimed at a reversal of the decline in ODA ; and finding lasting solutions to the debt problems of developing countries .  
Furthermore , the international community must examine the continued viability of frameworks for the protection of intellectual property , ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights of owners and innovators to a secure and appropriate return on their investment and the larger social benefit that would result from wide , unrestricted knowledge flows .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .

Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
On appeal , the European Court held , inter alia , that : the law was unreasonable ; it was impossible to prove the truth of opinions ; the characterization of the politician had been reasonable ; and the journalist ' s article had been part of a larger political debate and not merely a gratuitous attack on the individual concerned .  
The larger fiscal deficit partially offset the fall in private domestic demand , while monetary policy makers maintained an austere stance until midway through the year .  
Consequently , peacekeeping operations were becoming larger and more costly , and total peacekeeping expenditure for the current fiscal year was expected to be more than double that for the preceding fiscal year .  
The new Plan takes into account the results achieved , lessons learned and gaps remaining from the previous Plan ( 19971999 ) , as well as changes in the larger social , economic , political and cultural contexts .  
UNEP has also recognized that a strong regional architecture is central to its ability to manage and advance the larger global environmental agenda and has accordingly enhanced its regional presence .  
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
In the process of rural industrialization , independent entrepreneurs cater for local and international markets and act as subcontractors to larger domestic and foreign firms , thus further intensifying market integration .  
With the total stock of debt virtually unchanged in nominal terms , and gross national product ( GNP ) growth rates exceeding 5 per cent in both developed and transition economies , debt to GNP ratios improved in all regions , and provisional figures for debt to exports ratios even show larger improvements ( table 1 ) .  
In summary , let me state that we the peoples of the United Nations should be determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of terrorism ; to reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained ; and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom .  
Among the nuclei , the diameters of the 11 larger ones range from 2 to 4 kilometers .  The explosion energy caused by these collisions will reach as high as 10-trillion tons of TNT dynamite , and equivalent to the explosive power of 500-million atomic bombs similar to those dropped on Hiroshima . A colossal fireball and soaring mushroom cloud may be formed in Jupiter 's atmosphere whose projectiles would be thrown to a height of several thousand kilometers .  
As permitted entry into the market expands , and tariffs are reduced and nontariff measures abolished , foreign products , services , and investment may enter our market on a larger scale ; as a result , our domestic enterprises will face more intense competition , and in particular , enterprises with high production costs , low level of technology , and backward management will face still more severe challenges .  
New actors and actresses must be diligent , assiduous , modest and prudent .  They must learn from the artistic morality and styles of old and famous actors and actresses in order to make larger steps on the road of art and to become mature faster .  
So , improving the quality of creative works and offering a larger quantity of excellent works involving producers ' great efforts is the most important task among important tasks of the military 's literary and artistic work in the future period .  
If we combine requirements and possibilities in our considerations , we discover that our army and those of developed Western countries show remarkable differences .  Our army 's equipment development has been carried out in a larger context , ensuring that economic development is the center , and has developed under an increasingly constrained situation .  National conditions , military conditions , and the requirements of the " three steps forward " strategy have all determined that our army must pursue equipment development in strides .  
From this , our army 's development , based on support , has proceeded only on a shrunken scale , weakening the military 's function in managing society ; the larger development trend has already gradually realized self-support capabilities integrated with socialized support .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
The Clinton administration proposed a limited defense system which was confined to a land-based deployment .  According to the plan , a system composed of 100 interceptors would be built inside the country which was capable of dealing with about 20-30 attacking ballistic missiles .

The masses of the people clapped and cheered at all these achievements .  
The Chinese government encourages foreign investors , especially multinational corporations , to invest and run fund - and technology-intensive projects ; to initiate a larger number of advanced technology-related projects ; and to invest in auxiliary and coordinative projects as well as projects aimed to earn foreign currency through exports , including electromechanical products , the components and parts industry , and raw materials .  
In particular , the law enforcement capabilities at the grassroots level should be enhanced .  While raising the quality of personnel , it is also necessary to strengthen the development of the information systems of government regulatory bodies and upgrade their equipment .  It is necessary to build larger platforms to achieve information sharing between departments .  
For the sake of ensuring the unity of our motherland , the Chinese armed forces are perfectly capable of monitoring fixed and moving targets along the southeastern coast and nearby waters , to spot , track , and identify medium-sized and larger military vessels .  They are capable of anytime , all-weather monitoring of large warships ( mainly aircraft carriers ) .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Nevertheless , the maintenance of a stable Renminbi still depends upon a steady external economic environment and the international monetary system .  If the value of Japanese yen plummets and the US dollar depreciates by a wide margin , the impact will be much larger than Renminbi itself .

For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .

A rising and responsible power , China 's constructive participation in global , regional , and major international issues will inevitably make Sino-US cooperation more fruitful .  
Since early June , the larger part north of the Huang He has experienced a hot weather with hardly any rain .  During this period , high temperatures lasted for several consecutive days in northwest China , north China , northeast China , as well as the Huang He and Huai He regions , worsening the drought that began to break out in north and northwest China in the spring of this year and causing the drought in the western part of northeast China to drastically deteriorate .  
In the long run , the RMB will move from a larger fluctuation range to floating freely , and will become freely convertible in the end ; and this can be said a gradual process of relaxing foreign exchange controls .  If such a process can be materialized in an appropriate way , the RMB can be turned into an international currency at the cost of the minimum shock .  
It has been reported that the demand of the general public for an early close of the case is increasingly building up .  At the Xiamen City People 's Congress session , which was held not long ago , a deputy pointed out : So long as the case is not closed , instability factors will loom larger and larger in society .  This will seriously disrupt Xiamen 's economic and social life and injure Xiamen 's reputation at home and overseas .  
We must actively implement the " outward bound " strategy of opening up , encourage domestic industries with competitive edge and larger production capacities to transfer their operations to developing countries , and set up overseas bases for processing trade and resource development .

" The major measures mainly include adding eight noisy occupations to the existing list of 17 specified noisy occupations for which compensation is payable so as to enable a larger number of claimants to become eligible to compensation , and waiving the requirement for the cost of hearing test and medical examination , " he said , noting that some 8,900 people are employed under the proposed eight occupations .  
All election advertisements must be marked with serial numbers except a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or by electronic means , and balloons .  
To meet this objective , we may need to consider steering away from the past approach in which urban renewal had been conducted in a piecemeal manner .  Instead , we will plan urban renewal and rehabilitation more comprehensively for larger areas , with a view to more effectively restructuring and re-planning the old urban areas , re-designing a more effective and environmentally friendly transport and road network , replacing incompatible land uses , adding open space , and designing buildings which meet the demands of modern living .

Yet employment of manual workers at construction sites and employment in the manufacturing sector continued to show marked decreases .  
For cases involving mains exceeding 600 mm in diameter , as the suspension of water supply will affect a larger area and cause inconvenience to a greater number of population , careful consideration and special arrangements are required for closing the valves and providing alternative supply .  It is therefore inappropriate to set a rigid standard for the processing time of such cases .  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
There was an overwhelming response from singleton applicants .  According to the then prevailing policy , they could choose to buy a Small Flat up to 28 square metres saleable in their normal turn of flat selection , or purchase a larger HOS flat up to 51 square metres saleable when all family households have completed their flat selection .  
The slightly larger year-on-year decline in the Composite CPI in May than in April was mainly attributable to accelerated decreases in the prices of some food items especially those of fresh fruits and salt water fish amidst an abundant supply , which more than offset the effect of reduced declines in the charges of certain miscellaneous services such as cinema entertainment and long distance calls .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
It was reported that on 5th of this month , a surgeon of the Prince of Wales Hospital was suspended from clinical duties with immediate effect by the Chief of Service of the Department of Surgery , allegedly because he had been impolite to his superior .

In view of the economic situation , the Housing Authority has not adjusted its public housing rents since 1998 .  The rents for many flats are still at 1995 levels .  Arising from other factors such as the sale and redevelopment of housing estates and the allocation of larger flats , the current median rent-to-income ratio is above 10% .  However , to the extent that this phenomenon has arisen not as a direct consequence of rental adjustments , the Housing Authority has not broken the law .  
First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

Market trends in Europe and the U . S . this year show that older people are buying ceramic dolls to pass on to the younger generation . International demand for gift items , steadily increasing apace of world population growth and improved living standards , has led to the development of worldwide gift industries . Advanced nations often phase out their production of small gifts in favor of larger , technical and high profit items .  
Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential . In addition , the specter of rising labor costs and tougher international copyright and trademark laws have further intensified the need for local manufacturers to do their own industrial design , marketed under their own labels .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Our reliance upon foreign countries is still great . As the U . S . seeks royalties for its reading material , we can compete on a reasonable basis if we can increase the prices of these materials in order to benefit R . O . C . products . On the other hand , academic , educational , and technological material might be sold in larger quantities at lower prices .  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
Li Xinkui states that in the larger southern Chinese cities , there is a real " resurgence of complex characters , " but that it is " mainly restricted to a few organizations with relatively close contacts with Hong Kong and Taiwan , or else to ordinary people trying to pass themselves off as cultured , as it is fashionable to show that one is able to write complex characters . "  
One can only be accepted by the association governing hawk-raising if the bird is not only alive after 3-5 years , but still has glossy feathers , is highly spirited , and has not been in any way " maltreated . " Only then is one considered qualified to get permission to raise other varieties which are larger or harder to handle .  
Chen Hui-sheng says that there are some people raising huge eagles or vultures smuggled in from abroad . Yet Taiwan 's suburbs lack rabbits or foxes or other larger types of prey . " It 's like bombing a chicken with napalm , " says the well-informed Chen . Wide-wingspread falcons are extremely fast , and require a huge amount of space , and are completely unsuitable for mountainous Taiwan .  
Compared to these sites , Chengziya is much larger , and many more large artifacts have been discovered . " In fact , it already transcends the traditional ' fortress ' type compound , which was mainly for defense , and is a ' city ' in the sense of a political , economic , and cultural center .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
The tradition of " eight treasures " Since the Chou Dynasty the Chinese have developed a roster of the " eight most excellent treasures , " dishes which satisfy delicate and exquisite tastes . Favored delicacies have differed from era to era , such as bear paws , swiftlet nests , monkey brains , ape lips and camel humps . Because the number of choice dishes has grown larger and larger , the list has been more precisely divided into four categories of " eight treasures " : mammals , seafood , poultry , and vegetables .  
Insecurity follows like a shadowIt is ironic that larger factories often choose to close or move simply because they are large and successful : in order to protect the corporate image , they have to observe the Labor Standards Law and environmental regulations , so they have high operating costs ; also large enterprises occupy much larger - - and more valuable - - amounts of land .  
Moreover , her articles were rigorously structured , with clearly presented lines of thinking for readers to follow . A second special feature is that she did not avoid expressing her positions on important issues facing the country and society . Her works were filled with support for " nativism " and " Taiwan first . " This set her apart from the introspective faction of writers who shied away from touching upon larger debates of collective interest .  
Taiwan had long hoped to join CITES and play a larger role in international conservation , but had always been hindered by political factors . International conservation groups were therefore " disappointed " by the fact that one of the reasons CITES left Yemen and South Korea off the list of countries for sanctions was that they intended to join the organization , without yet showing concrete improvements , and many countries confided that they were outraged on Taiwan 's behalf .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
" Multi-cinema theater houses are the trend of the future . Big theaters are only a promotional gimmick , the attraction of a huge screen , " says Robert Chen , associate professor of communication arts at Fujen Catholic University . During the 100-year development of the movie , it has evolved from an art form into a small-group social activity . It is easy to comprehend why empty echoes are often heard in the larger cinemas .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
In that time of controversy , " Tsai Yuan-pei could be said to have been the least controversial personality , " says Ambrose King in the book Daxue de Linian ( The Idea of the University ) . In his hands , Beida became a real university , a center for new culture and modern thinking in China . But Tsai did not belong only to Beida ; he also belonged to a larger academic and cultural community .  
" The larger his paintings are , the greater they are , and these large paintings from after he was 70 are his most important and representative , " says Lin Hsin-yueh . Yang , whose work focused on nature throughout his life , had a hearty and robust character . " He was a real man . " The powerful and moving brushstrokes in these large works that need no detailed commentary completely convey his forthright personality as well as the incomparable power of nature .  
Chen Yi-ming points out that male genitalia are less likely to develop sores , and the mucus membranes in female sexual organs have a larger number of monocytes that are receptive to viruses . In addition , seminal fluid contains more viruses than vaginal fluid . For these reasons , women are more easily infected by men than vice versa .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
Playboy 's Lolita Hu notes that given its power to reach larger and wider audiences , the television medium is subject to greater restriction than magazines . Consequently , Taiwan 's TV programs are still unsure how to present comprehensive attitudes toward the body . Meanwhile , the permissible degree of bodily exposure is similarly narrower , at most merely reflecting trends in society .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel . The situation has been especially serious in the mass media . In all areas of media , including TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines , the market is saturated , and few people are leaving their jobs .  
There are also a number of architectural elements in the exhibit , including banisters , column capitals , tiles , and flagstones from the king 's palace . These items have all just been excavated in the past five years , and are highly significant finds as they come from the oldest royal palace ever discovered in China . The exhibit also reproduces a beautiful stream paved with small , closely packed dark-gray pebbles interspersed with larger yellowish pebbles .  
Thanks to this explanation and analysis , readers can understand everything from the works of Shakespeare to the lives of Taiwan 's aborigines , from the views of the Dalai Lama , to those of the overseas Chinese singing star Lee-hom Wang . There is international news and also domestic news . Some of it 's serious , and some of it 's trendy . These English-instruction magazines attest to the fact that Taiwanese appetites for information are getting larger and increasingly varied !  
The mainlanders have introduced the cuisines of their home provinces and a longing for the old country . Likewise , the attitudes of civil servants loyal to the KMT have also taken firm root in Taipei . What 's more , a larger proportion of Hakkas live in Taipei than any place ooutside of their traditional bases in the countryside , and the city also has a large community of aborigines . With this population structure , the Taiwanese chauvinism so prevalent in southern Taiwan is rather rare in Taipei .  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
Every 11 years , when the solar magnetic field goes into overdrive , in some areas of the sun 's surface the temperature sinks to 4000oC , so that these areas look darker in color than the surrounding photosphere . Seen from the earth they appear as small dark spots on the face of the sun , but in fact a single sunspot may be many times larger than the total surface area of the earth .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
They range from familiar staples such as acupuncture , moxibustion , Chinese herbal medicine , qigong and shiatsu , to more exotic-sounding varieties such as homeopathy , magnetic healing and energetic medicine . ( Homeopathy is a traditional European treatment method in which the practitioner first diagnoses the patient 's symptoms , then prescribes tiny doses of drugs that in larger quantities would elicit the same symptoms . The drug 's affinity for the disease boosts the body 's own defense mechanisms . This is similar to the Chinese principle of " fighting poison with poison . " )  
Moreover , there is national financial distress with the government deficit exceeding NT $ 3 trillion . If loans are raised to hire unemployed workers , then a balanced budget will not be attainable within the foreseeable future . This bill would also dampen the improving economy and delay financial reform efforts , and the misallocation of resources would influence larger government projects , and be detrimental to long-term economic growth .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
Wu says that the causes of low creativity and the cultural context are being fixed , but no systematic changes have been made as yet . One encouraging point is that the MOE has included creativity as a core educational ability . Industry , government , and the educational sector , however , have yet to come together . If all of them can move forward together and embrace one another , the circle will get larger and larger .  
This falls a long way short of the target of 1.5 million households , but is a good start nevertheless . By contrast , at present only around 40-50 larger sets of photovoltaic panels are installed in Taiwan to generate electricity from the sun 's rays . On public land and buildings , to date the MOEA has completed demonstration systems in only a few locations including the Presidential Palace and the Yushan meteorological observatory . There is also little sign of enthusiasm for installations on ordinary residential buildings .  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
Although a larger flow of external funding and assistance to human settlements development is a desirable outcome , sustainability can only be achieved in the medium and long term by using scarce external resources in a strategic and catalytic way .  
However , the programme approach may still be pursued if the individual projects are conceived as catalytic elements for larger national programmes , thoroughly designed , supported also by either domestic resources or nonUnited Nations donors .  
It was generally realized that the only viable socioeconomic system was one that respected the freedom of the individual and focused on promoting social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom .  
However , new refugees continued to arrive from southern Iraq and , unless effective preventive policies were pursued , a larger refugee inflow could be recorded in the months ahead .  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
In this wider breakthrough of understanding in the universe , let us be thankful that on this tiny planet there is on the East River in New York a piece of land where people meet to discuss problems some no bigger than an ant-hill and some larger thankful that somewhere there is a little hill called Everest near Kathmandu where lilliputian human ants can crawl up and become heroes !  
This culture , in the larger , anthropological sense , included not only artistic expression and common languages and vernacular languages , but also the ways of life , social organization and technology that arise from the creativity , ability to adapt and intelligence that men and women have had accumulated over time across the five continents . 
Pluralism is essential to the transition to a democratic government , but in a larger sense encompassing periodic elections , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
We constantly acknowledge that we now live in an era in which interconnected economic and social issues have assumed larger prominence on the international agenda , in which the call for cooperation across State boundaries to address these urgencies has intensified , and in which , as a result of our global interdependence , the need for vital , responsive and effective international institutions to address new demands is all the more imperative .  
By contrast , many traditional manufacturing industries , particularly those located in rural areas which are more numerous , more labour intensive and employ a larger proportion of women , especially during slack periods in the agricultural cycle , have stagnated under the pressure of increased competition . 
The research also concluded that capital requirements of the new technologies were much larger than that for previous vintages of equipment which increases the level of plant output necessary to reduce unit costs , and , that while product knowledge and marketing requirements had increased with the new technologies , there had also been a reduction in the need for administrative and managerial functions and as a result no firm judgement could be made regarding changes in firm scale . 
In view of the modest number of replies received and the diverse nature of the information communicated , the Special Rapporteur decided to reproduce in his report the texts according to country rather than present an analytical summary according to subject , assuming that a larger number of Governments would submit more complete and more precise information .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
As the Commissioner-General has pointed out , the parties to this process and the major donors to the Agency have asked UNRWA not only to maintain its existing services throughout its area of operations during the interim period , but to play a larger role in helping to effect improvements in the social and economic spheres in which the Agency has acquired a special expertise .  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
The report pointed out that obvious indicators such as staff size larger than the approved level ( 300 instead of 71 ) , excessive overhead , large suspense account balances , a large number of unpaid bills and excess expenditure were ignored or not effectively followed up for redress .  
It also asked Governments and agencies of the United Nations system to promote programmes for guiding management and corrective actions to control pollution in the larger coastal urban settlements , specifically in the treatment of sewage and waste disposal , both domestic and industrial , as well as to control pollution in river systems caused by mining industries .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
The observed trend of a larger increase in minimum than in maximum temperatures is apparently linked to associated increases in low clouds and aerosols and to the enhanced greenhouse effect .  
Also , while trying to reconstruct their economy and lay the foundations for their future State , the Palestinians were aware of the need for eventual integration into a larger economic context and developing mutually beneficial ties with countries of the Middle East , North Africa and the Mediterranean basin .  
It is also increasingly recognized by disaster-prone country authorities and by many donors that a larger proportion of international assistance should be focused on addressing the root causes of disaster , through suitably adapted prevention and preparedness programmes which maximize the mobilization of national and especially local community resources , drawing upon the skills and expertise of all relevant regional and international agencies .  
The introduction of the second cycle of basic education ( seventh , eighth and ninth years ) and the admission to it of a larger number of pupils may lead to an increase in the numbers failing to complete the course unless teaching methods and curricula are altered .  
It should particularly be mentioned that maps utilized by the Azeri side are , first , drawn on a distorted scale , as Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent territories , in comparison with the neighbouring regions , are drawn larger than they are in reality , and second , the line of the Karabagh-Azeri military contact is drawn more eastwards than the genuine borders of the confrontation : a fact to be easily observed if Azeri maps are compared with the military and other maps used by the OSCE Minsk Group on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict . 
The administrative component of UNMOT would be strengthened to support the larger Mission , as would its communications , road and air transport and other facilities , bearing in mind the mountainous terrain and the bad state of repair of the roads , many of which are cut off as a result of damage or will be impassable for several months in winter .  
However , foreign direct investment in developing countries , as well as the recent parallel surge in international portfolio investment , has been concentrated in the more advanced economies , the larger economies and those with high rates of economic growth .  
Our memory has become so short that those same people who raised their voices against the German capital 's concrete wall now justify , promote and even stand up for a 10-times larger and much more heavily fortified wall that would divide the poor South from the developed North , along the Rio Grande all the way to Baja California , and which very few dare to denounce . 
At the same time , these anti-poverty strategies are to be defined and implemented in the larger context of creating an environment that encourages and supports equitable , broad-based economic growth and social development at both the national and international levels .  
Despite the major role that non-governmental organizations play in supporting improved environmental management of the drylands and the strong support of many smaller non-governmental organizations at the negotiations for the Convention , it is disappointing that the larger international non-governmental organizations have not played a more prominent role in the follow-up process .  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The current setting is characterized by the need for ( i ) larger capital resources , ( ii ) sophisticated technology , including information technology which can improve management practices and assure instantaneous access to information , and ( iii ) human skills for access to global markets .  
For Malaysia , as a developing country , economic , social and cultural rights , articulated through the larger framework of the right to development , are as important as civil and political rights .  
Another area of greatest need is the development of small satellite technology , which has strong potential for offering a larger number of countries affordable access to space through the rapid development of fully integrated national space programmes .  
The variables were standardized and equal weights assigned to them in the computation of the composite vulnerability index , which confirmed that small island developing States were generally more vulnerable than larger countries . 
The urbanization trends experienced by developed countries until the 1950s suggested that the increasing concentration of the urban population in ever larger urban centres was a natural concomitant of the rising proportion of people living in urban areas .  
In the later case , a central , larger hub station connected via the space segment to the various remote sites , which were equipped with small , simple and relatively cheap satellite antennas .  
Their gross domestic product ( GDP ) had been over 5 per cent , inflation had stood at a 50-year low and a larger proportion of the increased capital flows into the region had been made up of foreign direct investment .  
High growth of gross national product ( GNP ) or the reduction of inflation does not lead to development unless it is accompanied by changes in the distribution of income , enabling a larger portion of the population to realize their economic , social and cultural rights .  
That figure , which was much lower than in any of the previous three years , could be attributed to two main factors : first , the major contributor had made a significantly larger regular budget payment during the final quarter of 1998 than in previous years , with less being deferred for payment in the year ; and , second , a record 117 Member States had paid their regular budget assessments in full by the end of 1998 , a continued upward trend which the Secretary-General wished to acknowledge .  
Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres . 
Special development situations require an integrated approach to security and development , one that entails programmes set in a time-frame larger than three years and that has as an integral part , from the outset of the peace-building process , social and community development programmes designed to meet the basic needs of the population .  
New procedures enabling the delivery of debt relief more rapidly and to a larger group of beneficiaries will indeed be essential for solving the debt overhang problems of the poor , heavily indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; and special arrangements are required for those emerging from civil war and strife and presenting exceptional economic rehabilitation assistance needs .  
In view of the continuous expansion of the functions and responsibilities of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section of the Secretariat to meet the demand of a growing number of applications for consultative status as well as the diverse , more substantive demands of a larger and more active non-governmental organizations community , the Committee suggested , at its resumed 1998 session , that this item remain in the agenda of the Committee .  
Once a junior company has identified a commercial deposit and carried out initial development work , the deposit is usually sold to larger corporations with better financial and technical resources .  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
The combined gross national product of the aggressors is 1,163 times that of the victim , their population 77 times larger , their territory 226 times bigger , their troops 43 times more numerous .  The Serb people 's resistance has been heroic , but at what a cost : thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded , terrible deprivation , a country in ruins , children traumatized for life by the bombing .  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
These include reorganization of divisions ; formal procedures for setting priorities and monitoring at regular monthly meetings with clients ; establishing a continuing legal education programme for its staff to keep abreast of developments in , for example , the financing , insurance , copyright and trademark and arbitration fields ; playing a larger role in the selection and training of legal officers for peacekeeping missions and establishment of a time-keeping system .  
These regimes seek to strike an acceptable balance between the need for intellectual property owners to secure an appropriate rate of financial return on their investment in knowledge , and the larger social benefits that would flow from rapid and unrestricted knowledge flows .  
We the peoples of the United Nations determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights , . . . to establish conditions under which justice . . . can be maintained , and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom , . . . have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims .  
In the area of the mobilization of external resources for development , the challenges ahead include the following : mobilizing enhanced and more stable sources of international investment flows towards a larger number of recipient developing countries ; strengthening international cooperation aimed at a reversal of the decline in ODA ; and finding lasting solutions to the debt problems of developing countries .  
Furthermore , the international community must examine the continued viability of frameworks for the protection of intellectual property , ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights of owners and innovators to a secure and appropriate return on their investment and the larger social benefit that would result from wide , unrestricted knowledge flows .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
Such low-income countries find considerable difficulty in attracting private foreign investment or loans from commercial banks , while loans from the international financial institutions have generally been concentrated in the larger countries .

In 53 years the number of independent countries has grown fourfold , and new great Powers can , whether on economic , demographic or geopolitical grounds , legitimately claim a larger share of international responsibility .  
As we prepare to enter the twenty-first century , and cognizant of the challenges that will confront our continent and peoples , we emphasize the imperative need and a high sense of urgency to rekindle the aspirations of our peoples for stronger unity , solidarity and cohesion in a larger community of peoples transcending cultural , ideological , ethnic and national differences .  
In moving towards a world in which the benefits of scientific and technological change are spread more widely across society , public and private institutions will increasingly be called upon to motivate and interact with a larger and more diverse number of actors than in the past , for the process of innovation is interactive and system-wide .  
In terms of programme areas covered by both bilateral and multilateral commitments , those that received larger shares were human resource development , transport and communication , freshwater resources , land resources , coastal and marine resources , and energy resources .  
The general trend , noticeable to varying degrees in the provinces visited , was the gradual dismantling of the larger camps for the displaced and regrouped and the creation of smaller , decentralized sites , located near military outposts and inhabited by people from the neighbouring hills .  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
On appeal , the European Court held , inter alia , that : the law was unreasonable ; it was impossible to prove the truth of opinions ; the characterization of the politician had been reasonable ; and the journalist ' s article had been part of a larger political debate and not merely a gratuitous attack on the individual concerned .  
The larger fiscal deficit partially offset the fall in private domestic demand , while monetary policy makers maintained an austere stance until midway through the year .  
Consequently , peacekeeping operations were becoming larger and more costly , and total peacekeeping expenditure for the current fiscal year was expected to be more than double that for the preceding fiscal year .  
The new Plan takes into account the results achieved , lessons learned and gaps remaining from the previous Plan ( 19971999 ) , as well as changes in the larger social , economic , political and cultural contexts .  
UNEP has also recognized that a strong regional architecture is central to its ability to manage and advance the larger global environmental agenda and has accordingly enhanced its regional presence .  
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
Would-be partitionists need to understand that the global trend is towards larger , not smaller , economic and political spaces , in which citizens and group rights are guaranteed and protected through democratic institutions and the rule of law , not through ethnic cleansing or marginalization , or the creation of non-viable para-States .  
In the process of rural industrialization , independent entrepreneurs cater for local and international markets and act as subcontractors to larger domestic and foreign firms , thus further intensifying market integration .  
With the total stock of debt virtually unchanged in nominal terms , and gross national product ( GNP ) growth rates exceeding 5 per cent in both developed and transition economies , debt to GNP ratios improved in all regions , and provisional figures for debt to exports ratios even show larger improvements ( table 1 ) .  
In summary , let me state that we the peoples of the United Nations should be determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of terrorism ; to reaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights , in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained ; and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom .
