Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
It 's got a strong smell when you 're eating it , and it 's packed with flavor too . The steamed stinky tofu in Chekiang restaurants is also very popular . It can be mixed with green beans or hot sauce and other flavorings .  
Yet , at present , national and communal woods of the mountain and river areas aside , there has been a longstanding lack of regulations governing the proportion of land allotted for building purposes , apart from on highways and in public parks . Development plans for residential and industrial-commercial areas still do not take into consideration the conservation and exploitation of green resources .  
When you get to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial in Taipei , you see a gaggle of men dressed up as " old grandmas . " Their faces are painted with rouge , and they wear skirts splashed with red and green . They carry fans in their left hands and parasols in their right . The gaudy makeup attracts a great number of curious people who want to have commemorative photos taken .  
Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea . " It 's not very expensive , and you can drink a huge glass for half the price of a cup of coffee , and even spend several hours hanging out , " says a middle school student who often does just that with her classmates after the school bell rings .  
There 's nothing very strange about seeing a white , yellow , or red traffic stripe on the street . But in the city of Oroville , California , about200 kilometers north of San Francisco , there are some stripes painted in bold green across the roadways .  
Except for the area around the interchange , the streets are two lane affairs . No matter - they are lined on both sides by refreshing ranks of trees , and there is a pervasive sense of " green . " On the shaded roads , a green line runs parallel to the white and yellow ones .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
Twisting around rivers , green mountains and verdant valleys , the railway accompanies the ample and profound Pacific in an interlude when it runs parallel to the coast , occasionally crossing paths with the coastal highway . The railway winds a circuitous path around the mountain peaks , ducking in and out between pitch black shadow and shimmering light .  
The color of these pieces of jade , buried for thousands of years in the mud , is not mossy green or ocher , as one might expect ; it is milky white , what antique experts term " chicken bone white . "  
It grows on the Hengchun peninsula by the Central Mountain Range in the far south of the island , and also on Orchid Island ( Lanyu ) to the east of Taiwan . This pure powdery white flower which blooms in great numbers is sometimes called the Taiwan Amah because of the similarity in sound of its scientific name , Phalaenopsis Amabilis . Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
The path was built along the playful , light current of the crisp , green Shakatang River . The little trail runs not far above the river bed . After catching sight of such an unpolluted river , who can resist the temptation to leap into the bubbling waters and swim ?  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs . Only at this stage , when nothing will distract their attention , can researchers take advantage of this time to take measurements of the sea turtles and the length and width of the hole , make labels and establish a basic data base .  
At first the tile facing was very dark in color , but it later became more pale , evolving toward the international fashion for white exteriors . The High Court building , completed in 1934 , with its light green tile facade on the second and third stories , can be seen as a turning point .  
Whenever a temple celebration took place , by the side of the glistening green rice paddies could be seen the strangest of processions : following in twos and threes behind the manically colorful flower trucks were old gents on bicycles and youngsters on motorcycles , as if under a magic spell , eyes fixed straight ahead on the dancing and twisting flower truck girls , to whom " wearing clothes and being naked is about the same thing . "  
Black ValleyTo produce red thread , the thread is boiled with flakes of a red wood called suma ; green dye is made from the leaf sap of the sulugor plant ; and yellow dye comes from the pounded root of the saninag plant . In order to dye thread black , however , it must be buried in the soil of Black Valley with crushed leaves from the chiuchiung tree , and after two days and nights in the soil it is ready .  
To my surprise , the children all set to with enthusiasm , some painting a mothers ' singing group , some painting the accompanying orchestra , along with a blue sky , the green grass and red flowers of the park , and fountains , trees , butterflies and birds , to make a vivid , richly colorful picture .  
Through their goggles , a clear and peaceful ocean world spans before them . Group after group of light blue light yellow and light green stony coral grow from the sandy sea bed . Red and green algae are scattered about . Thus begins their trip through this " ocean flower garden . "  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by . Menacing lionfish , covered with what seem to be thorns and claws , swim along face down . Upon seeing human divers - - what strange creatures ! - - sea snakes swim by and touch their flippers . . . .  
As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
After looking at the splendor of the exquisite porcelain of the Song , Ming and Qing dynasties , we can then turn back to see the painted pottery and black basalt pottery of the neolithic age , the rich variety of the funerary objects of the Han dynasty , the green glaze pottery of the Wei and Jin , and the gorgeous Tang tricolor glaze . This will help us to better understand the course of development of Chinese ceramics .  
He adds : " In fact , looking at our jade collection alone is like entering a 7000-year time tunnel . " Private treasuresFrom the jade totems of the Shang and Yin dynasties to the ritual jade of the Zhou dynasty and the burial jade of the Han , and on through to the ornamental jade and " ingeniously carved jade " - - such as the Chinese cabbage carved from a single piece of green and white jadeite - - of the Ming and Qing dynasties , the Chinese have always treasured jade above all else .  
Off to the right , light green squares are inlaid amidst dark verdant patches of mango trees and sparkling streams running through gorges . This is where we plan to land . Off to the left , the little spot of white amidst the puffs of smoke and dense green is Saichia Village . When you lift your gaze to the horizon , your field of vision takes in Kaoshu , Chishan , and Pingtung .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
In the boundless expanse of flat paddy fields , a thick wall of greenery , behind which one glimpses a home with green trees , a blue sky , grey tiles , a low red brick wall around , and whitewashed walls . Following the winding path which twists its way along the low banks between the fields , the front door comes into view .  
Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
After the brief upturn in the first quarter of last year , the monitoring signal score slid from its peak level - - the " yellow-red light , " which indicates a booming economy - - through the " green light " which indicates moderately strong economic activity , past the rather sluggish " yellow-blue light , " and all the way to the worrisome " blue light " !  
The tiles of the emperor 's palace in Peking shone " like gold " under the sun . The Bao En Temple in Nanking was particularly impressive , being constructed from a number of attractive buildings in the center of which was a porcelain pagoda of nine storeys , roofed with yellow and red tiles with hints of green . At its eaves were bells which rang continuously in the breeze .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
Using hot springs water to irrigate water convoluvus makes it grow to great size without being overripe . The sponge gourds are plump and firm , and they wo n't go dark when cooked . The whites of the water oats are really white , and the greens truly green with absolutely no black bit at the core .  
For example , Chef Chen reveals a dish called " Fresh Mushroom Treasure Chest " ( made from mushrooms deep fried in oil to a golden color and then wokfried with lily bulbs and the tender stalks and leaves of peas ) and another called " Splendid Jade Flute " ( made with zhusheng edible fungus , vegetarian chicken , cane shoots , and green beans ) . Neither is difficult to prepare at home .  
As the sun sets in Kaohsiung County 's Yanchao Township , the Chinan Highway is bathed in the yellow twilight . Just out of school for the day , junior high school student A-Mo trudges along the straight line of the road , with an inexpressible desire in his heart : to return to a very special home-a freestanding red-brick building with a sloping roof , where the front yard is an expanse of green grass , and the back yard boasts a basketball court .  
The black plum ( Prunus mume-also known by other names such as the Japanese flowering apricot ) is a small deciduous tree of the rose family ( Rosaceae ) . Its new shoots are bright green ; the trunk is straight and vertical ; the flower petioles are short .  
With the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the 1640s China once again fell under the rule of a foreign people . At this time the accomplished plum painter Shi Tao , whose prospects of a brilliant civil service career were dashed by the Qing conquest , wrote this poem to the plum flower : " The green mountains and bright moon are the same as they always were and will be .  
However , new mayor Chen Shui-bian concluded that it 's better to get the pain over with for the long-term betterment of the city as a whole . Taipei is , after all , densely populated , and open , green space is increasingly to be valued . Moreover , the mayor does not want to be seen as someone who just " talks a good game " but does nothing when it comes to hard choices about improving the city and enforcing the law . Thus he adopted a firm attitude and proceeded with the demolition .  
For example , we tell people about the adverse effects of introducing non-native species into an area , or about how vital soil and water conservation is . " The green traveler revolution " Sometimes I wonder whether or not there is a form of social activism that can be gentle , even playful , without being combative , that can be effective with people hardly being conscious of it . "  
Pop start Andy Lau is wearing a pure white Sun Yat-sen jacket , standing against a backdrop of red flags , green hills , and a shimmering blue sky . This is a scene from his latest music video . Amidst swirling yellow sand , red flags flutter in the wind , and drummers wearing red sashes pound out the rhythm .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
As they stand in front of you , the color of their skin and nationality seems no longer to make any difference , and what becomes apparent is that Evergreen 's strong corporate culture-that " green " spirit with which the firm is so associated in Taiwan-is reverberating here in an exotic land on the other side of the world .  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
Wang Bo , who loved to write about ducks , mentions in a fu ( a piece of descriptive prose interspersed with verse ) how southeast of Zizhou in Sichuan , the Fu River ran through a pool only a few dozen paces around-a hidden place of green cliffs and splashing waves , where lone ducks often settled on the waters , flying up , sinking down , turning and quacking , quite in keeping with their nature .  
Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon . Their almond-shaped pupils , which change shape in shifting light , are eerie enough , without even considering that their eyes may give off a green luminescence ( from reflected light ) . And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
From the memories of old family members and from old photographs , one can reconstruct the exquisite scene of former times : at dawn the dense mist hanging over the seven pools enshrouds the surrounding paddy fields , but as the first rays of sunshine strike through , one sees the Li Family Compound , built of bricks and stone , standing sturdy among the expanse of green . This is why the local nickname for this great house was " Beauty in the Fields . "  
But most modern people instead consume great amounts of fish , meats , and fast food , and have long forgotten that there are many edible things in nature that are rich in nutrients . These green leafy vegetables can all provide vitamin C , iron , folic acid , and calcium .  
We even proposed that during that week , gays and supporters of gay rights in Taiwan wear a different color each day-red , orange , yellow , green , blue and purple-over six days , to express the expectations represented in the gay rainbow banner for peaceful dignity and equal respect . "  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
Earth Lord temples can often be found amid lush green expanses of paddy-field , watching over the crops and blessing them with healthy growth . P The tutelary god known as " Earth Lord " has become a bit of a celebrity of late , showing up in various TV series with his beaming smile and long white whiskers , his trademark magic ingot and ruyi scepter in hand , helping out hapless victims of mistreatment .  
The bushy eyebrows are " dyed " a deep green , the large eyes are accented with a deep-blue eye shadow , the lips are painted red , and the ears are pierced .  
A further key element of the counter-pornography policy is the TV classification system introduced in January this year , similar to movie classifications , in which programs are graded and color-coded according to content : red for " restricted , " yellow for " parental guidance , " blue for " protected " and green for " general audience . "  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
After we passed through the city of Konosu , the scenery became very rural , with rice fields on either side of the road . Farmhouses dotted the landscape , rice seedlings were planted in neat rows in flooded paddies , wisteria vines were sprouting their first tender green leaves of spring , and eager tips of grass were just beginning to push up through the sleepy spring soil .  
Hung out in front of many of the farmhouses were brightly colored carp streamers , with the carp 's golden scales glittering against backgrounds of black , red , blue , purple , green , orange . . . . The gay streamers fluttering in the breeze against a wide open sky only intensified the feeling of spring in the air .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
To portray a scene of verdant , mist-shrouded mountains in ceramic painting , it is necessary to use underglaze painting in combination with certain fluid , translucent glazes of brown and green . When fired , these glazes can produce a hazy effect which even ink and paper can not match .  
When one talks of Chinese architecture , what people are probably most familiar with is multi-layered dougong block-and-bracket structures under flying eaves , and vermilion pillars supporting square-paneled " caisson " ceilings painted with dragon-and-phoenix designs in gold , green and a rainbow of other colors-the " palatial " style .  
An important step in this painting process is adding fine white lines between the different strong colors-red , yellow , blue , green and gold-to make them appear more harmonious and less gaudy .  
From halfway up the mountain , the entire valley is visible . Looking up , one sees birds of prey circling . The dead acacia stands erect in the midst of a green forest halfway up the slope . When the wind blows , it exposes the silver back side of the leaves of the surrounding trees , and the dead acacia stands out still more clearly .  
" The biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says Tsao Chi-hung . " As more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . " The riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the East , the sunset in the West , and the dreamy river alongside the park .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water . Whether sold domestically or exported , Pinglin 's Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels . Both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90% of the people of Pinglin , life revolves around tea .  
Two decades later , the Japanese botanist Fukuyama Noriaki also collected pleiones from Mt . Hsiakalo in Hsinchu . This time the flowers were a pure , snowy white , and the onion-like bulbs were a glistening green color , unlike the previously discovered purple bulbs . Overjoyed at his discovery , Fukuyama named this new variety the snow-white pleione ( Pleione formosana var . nivea ) .  
In this showdown between political organizations , the ambitions and maneuverings of the most prominent party aristocrats are also getting considerable exposure . Looking at the structure of Taiwan 's voting population , at bottom the ratio of 60% blue vs . 40% green is quite firmly established , and parties on both sides are finding it difficult to make inroads into the other camp .  
" Let me take you soaring over a stretch of green fields / Piercing a tunnel of greenery bathed in the setting sun / Let the cool breeze and the fragrance of oranges run through your fingers / Cast off your worries and let your mind go free . The great peak beckons to me with a gesture / The secondary peak nods in my direction / The mountain coffee sends your troubles packing / The winding highland roads call : Hurry up and get started ! "  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
In addition to a trade function , agriculture performs roles in maintaining food security , in travel and leisure , maintaining a green environment , and even the social function of absorbing the unemployed . Agriculture offers many " side benefits " that can not be measured in terms of income . With the exception of a very few city states , no country , including those considered agriculturally viable , such as the US , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand , dares neglect the intangible values of agriculture .  
Take , for instance , Tuniu Elementary School in Shihkang , Taichung County . It has a sloping red roof ; exposed azure pipes ; blue , purple and yellow outer walls for the classroom buildings ; peach floors ; red and green stairwells ; dark blue pillars in the corridors ; green railings ; and picture windows that cover one-third of the walls . Vibrant color and striking moving lines are the dominant aesthetic . Paradise next to rice paddies  
When you visit Kinmen , everywhere you can see old villages with their houses neatly lined up on a north-south axis . Civilian residences preserving traditional Fujianese architecture form tight little knots . Red tiles , stone walls , and elegant " swallow-tail " roof ridges bounce sunlight off the fresh green fields , creating a leisurely ambience of small-island warmth and security .  
Tungting oolong , on the other hand , because the tea sprouts are soft and plump , and the brewed tea has a more robust dark green color , a richer fragrance , and a more full-bodied flavor , is likened to a newly married woman , mature yet tender and delicate .  
The work has and will stand the test of time because of its clever design that utilizes the original splendid coloration ( a mixture of white and green ) and the remarkable carving that rendered a piece of jade into a life-like cabbage with two katydids on top of it . The work , however , also shows jade carvings ' traditional limitations .  
Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
According to Wu Tse-jui from Meishan , preparing Mt . Ali tea for the market involves precise planting , careful selection , gentle rolling , and slow baking , especially for unfermented green tea .  
In mid April , the usually inky green , stiff and subdued Formosan rhododendron undergoes a complete change of character , suddenly bursting forth in a riot of blossoms that range in color from white to pink .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
Strolling around the embassy compound , I discover new greenery amidst the flowers and grass , so parched and brittle just a short time before . The green and sour mangoes on the trees have been transformed instantaneously , becoming lusciously red and ripe .  
On an afternoon in June , " A Demonstration of Efforts to Reawaken Traditional Atayal Song and Dance " was being held at the Chinyueh Elementary School in Nanao Town . With the distant green ridges of the Central Range seeming to hold the locale in their embrace , the air was fresh , the flowers fragrant and the birds singing , as the communities of Chinyueh and Piyahaw , young and old alike , came out to roast meat and enjoy the performances .  
In emu eggs the layers are clearly distinguished . The outer layer is a deep fleckstone green , the middle layer a rich teal , and the innermost layer is pure white . This lends a great deal of depth to the carved works .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
Just as famous as their green onions are their sand leeks , although they can only be grown over the two or three months of winter . With the abundant rainfall of the plain , the leeks , too , grow large and well proportioned . Their scent is pungent and their flavor strong , which makes them well suited to the different styles of cooking around Taiwan , and for the past few years they have been a Chinese New Year staple throughout the Taipei area .  
On the vast Chianan Plain with its endless views of green rice paddies redolent with rice blossoms , Wu Ching , a teacher of fine carving , kneels on the ground , head bent and eyes intently scanning the earth beneath him . A line of ants are marching across the ground . It could be accurately stated that the ants are focused on their work and completely oblivious to Wu Ching .  
Having decided to use gold as his creative medium , Wu set to work , using 99.99% pure gold that lacked the silver or copper that goldsmiths traditionally add to make welding easier ( but that in time cause oxidation , with the silver turning black and the copper green ) .  
Chen Yu-cheng was the sole exception . Chen considered the school uniform-a yellow shirt with a green collar , a green necktie , and green shorts-to be " totally weird and ugly . " But its ugliness was not the only reason Chen refused to wear the uniform : " To my mind , it 's unreasonable for the school to force students to wear a uniform . "  
On the 24th day following birth , it was customary to place a chicken egg , stone , coin , and green onion in a basin of water , which was then used to wash and shave the baby 's head , signifying the hope that the child would have a face as smooth and beautiful as an egg , have a skull as hard as a rock , make lots of money , and be smart .  
Six months earlier , when the team of prospective climbers from subtropical Taiwan submitted their application , the authorities had misgivings because of the youth of the applicants . Later when they realized that the students had quite a bit of high-mountain experience and had received training for snowy regions , they gave the green light .  
The man responsible for this is Liang Kuo-kuo , head of the Planning Department of the Taipei City Traffic Bureau 's Traffic Engineering Office . Hsinyi District is fairly big , says Liang , and the cycle lanes head along the " green belt " planned for each side of the district . The lanes pass along Sungkao Rd . , Sungchi Rd . , Sungjen Rd . and Sungteh Rd . , covering a total of 10.5 kilometers , and allow the public to ride along a shaded area and enjoy a bit of fresh air .  
An approach to marine pollution prevention " , GESAMP Report and Studies , No . 30 , 1986 .  Heavy trawls may be considered " green " on deep muddy grounds but " red " in shallow estuaries and coastal zones or coral reefs .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
In order to achieve essential food security , overcome the structural constraints inherent in current agricultural practices and better exploit existing potential , a new green revolution should be fostered to bring about both a massive improvement in water resources management and a major increase in the irrigation of arable land and in the application of scientific techniques to agricultural production ;  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
Below the 75-ft ( 22.86 m ) high base of the shallow dome , wood-slatted panels , interrupted by a wash of gold from ceiling to podium , descend against the outwardly tilted wall to the blue and green decor of the 165-ft ( 50.29 m ) long by 115-ft ( 35.05 m ) wide Hall .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
As certification is extended to more temperate , boreal and tropical products , then the " green premium " differential between certified and non-certified wood products will be substantially smaller and may eventually disappear .  
These plants allegedly are not even required to provide information to workers or community residents about emissions or chemicals used or stored and numerous incidents have been reported : they include a case of children being intoxicated at a dump in Ciudad Juarez by sniffing green rocks covered with a solvent containing toluene , and a maquiladora that closed and left in an abandoned building a dozen 55-gallon drums of hazardous material .  
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas .

Mercuric fish and green oysters ! When the inhabitants of Minimata Bay ate the mercury contaminated fish their muscles wasted away , they lost their sight , and became psychologically damaged . Brain damaged and finally paralyzed , many fell unconscious and nearly 150 of them died .  
The scrap metal dealers in Wanli in Tainan want to extract the most valuable metals , so they wash the scrap in acid . " Low-value " copper is washed out with the acid , and flows into the neighboring Er-jen River , both of whose banks are planted with the hollow green veggie . " The content of copper in the convolvulus is very high , " says Wang .  
Mr . Bigs should clean up their heavy metal : Faced with the red , blue , green , and other variously colored liquid pollutants generated by the electroplating industry , the industrial community ten years ago thought to follow the example of Japan and establish a special electroplating industrial zone to concentrate the scattered factories in one place and treat the waste water collectively .  
Climbing up onto an observation platform at the farm , banana trees are lined up in meticulous ranks one after another in the square and regular groves . More unusual is that each and every tree is upright and green , with hardly a single withered leaf to be found .  
Using green goods is only one part of green thinking . Even more important is lowering demand for material goods , and treasuring the things you already have , " explains Chang Kuo-lung , a professor of physics at National Taiwan University , of the origins of the green tide . He argues that in the two hundred years since the industrial revolution , the large-scale use of non-recyclable materials by mankind has allowed modern people to enjoy the same standard of living as an ancient emperor attended by 200 servants .  
Only the application in daily life of ideals c allow even more people to participate , so that everyone will realize that environmental protection is n't so difficult . One need only make a few adjustments in one 's basic living habits to be able to change the environment . The basic view of green consumption is the admonition : " Do n't avoid doing something just because the gain seems small ; do n't go ahead and do something just because the harm seems marginal . "  
It 's got a strong smell when you 're eating it , and it 's packed with flavor too . The steamed stinky tofu in Chekiang restaurants is also very popular . It can be mixed with green beans or hot sauce and other flavorings .  
Yet , at present , national and communal woods of the mountain and river areas aside , there has been a longstanding lack of regulations governing the proportion of land allotted for building purposes , apart from on highways and in public parks . Development plans for residential and industrial-commercial areas still do not take into consideration the conservation and exploitation of green resources .  
When you get to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial in Taipei , you see a gaggle of men dressed up as " old grandmas . " Their faces are painted with rouge , and they wear skirts splashed with red and green . They carry fans in their left hands and parasols in their right . The gaudy makeup attracts a great number of curious people who want to have commemorative photos taken .  
Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea . " It 's not very expensive , and you can drink a huge glass for half the price of a cup of coffee , and even spend several hours hanging out , " says a middle school student who often does just that with her classmates after the school bell rings .  
There 's nothing very strange about seeing a white , yellow , or red traffic stripe on the street . But in the city of Oroville , California , about200 kilometers north of San Francisco , there are some stripes painted in bold green across the roadways .  
Except for the area around the interchange , the streets are two lane affairs . No matter - they are lined on both sides by refreshing ranks of trees , and there is a pervasive sense of " green . " On the shaded roads , a green line runs parallel to the white and yellow ones .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
Twisting around rivers , green mountains and verdant valleys , the railway accompanies the ample and profound Pacific in an interlude when it runs parallel to the coast , occasionally crossing paths with the coastal highway . The railway winds a circuitous path around the mountain peaks , ducking in and out between pitch black shadow and shimmering light .  
The color of these pieces of jade , buried for thousands of years in the mud , is not mossy green or ocher , as one might expect ; it is milky white , what antique experts term " chicken bone white . "  
It grows on the Hengchun peninsula by the Central Mountain Range in the far south of the island , and also on Orchid Island ( Lanyu ) to the east of Taiwan . This pure powdery white flower which blooms in great numbers is sometimes called the Taiwan Amah because of the similarity in sound of its scientific name , Phalaenopsis Amabilis . Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
The path was built along the playful , light current of the crisp , green Shakatang River . The little trail runs not far above the river bed . After catching sight of such an unpolluted river , who can resist the temptation to leap into the bubbling waters and swim ?  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs . Only at this stage , when nothing will distract their attention , can researchers take advantage of this time to take measurements of the sea turtles and the length and width of the hole , make labels and establish a basic data base .  
At first the tile facing was very dark in color , but it later became more pale , evolving toward the international fashion for white exteriors . The High Court building , completed in 1934 , with its light green tile facade on the second and third stories , can be seen as a turning point .  
Whenever a temple celebration took place , by the side of the glistening green rice paddies could be seen the strangest of processions : following in twos and threes behind the manically colorful flower trucks were old gents on bicycles and youngsters on motorcycles , as if under a magic spell , eyes fixed straight ahead on the dancing and twisting flower truck girls , to whom " wearing clothes and being naked is about the same thing . "  
Black ValleyTo produce red thread , the thread is boiled with flakes of a red wood called suma ; green dye is made from the leaf sap of the sulugor plant ; and yellow dye comes from the pounded root of the saninag plant . In order to dye thread black , however , it must be buried in the soil of Black Valley with crushed leaves from the chiuchiung tree , and after two days and nights in the soil it is ready .  
To my surprise , the children all set to with enthusiasm , some painting a mothers ' singing group , some painting the accompanying orchestra , along with a blue sky , the green grass and red flowers of the park , and fountains , trees , butterflies and birds , to make a vivid , richly colorful picture .  
Through their goggles , a clear and peaceful ocean world spans before them . Group after group of light blue light yellow and light green stony coral grow from the sandy sea bed . Red and green algae are scattered about . Thus begins their trip through this " ocean flower garden . "  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by . Menacing lionfish , covered with what seem to be thorns and claws , swim along face down . Upon seeing human divers - - what strange creatures ! - - sea snakes swim by and touch their flippers . . . .  
As such , with its view of a wide expanse of water and green coastal ridges , the area is said to have especially auspicious geomantic properties . Thus the hillsides are covered with cemeteries advertised as " Fit for an Emperor or King , " " Home of the Dragon and Den of the Tiger , " or " Paradise . " For businessmen to build these cemeteries - - the most expensive and delightfully-sited on the island - - they had to first level the mountainsides and uproot the woods .  
After looking at the splendor of the exquisite porcelain of the Song , Ming and Qing dynasties , we can then turn back to see the painted pottery and black basalt pottery of the neolithic age , the rich variety of the funerary objects of the Han dynasty , the green glaze pottery of the Wei and Jin , and the gorgeous Tang tricolor glaze . This will help us to better understand the course of development of Chinese ceramics .  
He adds : " In fact , looking at our jade collection alone is like entering a 7000-year time tunnel . " Private treasuresFrom the jade totems of the Shang and Yin dynasties to the ritual jade of the Zhou dynasty and the burial jade of the Han , and on through to the ornamental jade and " ingeniously carved jade " - - such as the Chinese cabbage carved from a single piece of green and white jadeite - - of the Ming and Qing dynasties , the Chinese have always treasured jade above all else .  
Off to the right , light green squares are inlaid amidst dark verdant patches of mango trees and sparkling streams running through gorges . This is where we plan to land . Off to the left , the little spot of white amidst the puffs of smoke and dense green is Saichia Village . When you lift your gaze to the horizon , your field of vision takes in Kaoshu , Chishan , and Pingtung .  
Traditional dwellings used very direct methods to deal with these problems : " first avoid , then block . " Professor Lin Sheng-feng explains that the most common method was for traditional courtyard farmhouses to be surrounded by a " green wall " of bamboo planted as a windbreak . Later , " typhoon shutters " were developed : thick wooden boards or metal plates which could be hung up over windows .  
In the boundless expanse of flat paddy fields , a thick wall of greenery , behind which one glimpses a home with green trees , a blue sky , grey tiles , a low red brick wall around , and whitewashed walls . Following the winding path which twists its way along the low banks between the fields , the front door comes into view .  
Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
After the brief upturn in the first quarter of last year , the monitoring signal score slid from its peak level - - the " yellow-red light , " which indicates a booming economy - - through the " green light " which indicates moderately strong economic activity , past the rather sluggish " yellow-blue light , " and all the way to the worrisome " blue light " !  
The tiles of the emperor 's palace in Peking shone " like gold " under the sun . The Bao En Temple in Nanking was particularly impressive , being constructed from a number of attractive buildings in the center of which was a porcelain pagoda of nine storeys , roofed with yellow and red tiles with hints of green . At its eaves were bells which rang continuously in the breeze .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
This summer , in the wake of Typhoon Herb , which brought 30-year record rainfall , the water level in both reservoirs rose past the warning mark , and both had to discharge excess water . Ten days later , when Taipei County councillors flew by helicopter to inspect water resource areas , the surface of the Shihmen Reservoir was a seething mass of brown water . But by stark contrast , the waters of the Feitsui Reservoir were clear and green .  
Using hot springs water to irrigate water convoluvus makes it grow to great size without being overripe . The sponge gourds are plump and firm , and they wo n't go dark when cooked . The whites of the water oats are really white , and the greens truly green with absolutely no black bit at the core .  
For example , Chef Chen reveals a dish called " Fresh Mushroom Treasure Chest " ( made from mushrooms deep fried in oil to a golden color and then wokfried with lily bulbs and the tender stalks and leaves of peas ) and another called " Splendid Jade Flute " ( made with zhusheng edible fungus , vegetarian chicken , cane shoots , and green beans ) . Neither is difficult to prepare at home .  
As the sun sets in Kaohsiung County 's Yanchao Township , the Chinan Highway is bathed in the yellow twilight . Just out of school for the day , junior high school student A-Mo trudges along the straight line of the road , with an inexpressible desire in his heart : to return to a very special home-a freestanding red-brick building with a sloping roof , where the front yard is an expanse of green grass , and the back yard boasts a basketball court .  
The black plum ( Prunus mume-also known by other names such as the Japanese flowering apricot ) is a small deciduous tree of the rose family ( Rosaceae ) . Its new shoots are bright green ; the trunk is straight and vertical ; the flower petioles are short .  
With the collapse of the Ming dynasty in the 1640s China once again fell under the rule of a foreign people . At this time the accomplished plum painter Shi Tao , whose prospects of a brilliant civil service career were dashed by the Qing conquest , wrote this poem to the plum flower : " The green mountains and bright moon are the same as they always were and will be .  
However , new mayor Chen Shui-bian concluded that it 's better to get the pain over with for the long-term betterment of the city as a whole . Taipei is , after all , densely populated , and open , green space is increasingly to be valued . Moreover , the mayor does not want to be seen as someone who just " talks a good game " but does nothing when it comes to hard choices about improving the city and enforcing the law . Thus he adopted a firm attitude and proceeded with the demolition .  
For example , we tell people about the adverse effects of introducing non-native species into an area , or about how vital soil and water conservation is . " The green traveler revolution " Sometimes I wonder whether or not there is a form of social activism that can be gentle , even playful , without being combative , that can be effective with people hardly being conscious of it . "  
Pop start Andy Lau is wearing a pure white Sun Yat-sen jacket , standing against a backdrop of red flags , green hills , and a shimmering blue sky . This is a scene from his latest music video . Amidst swirling yellow sand , red flags flutter in the wind , and drummers wearing red sashes pound out the rhythm .  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
However , a permanent solution to the problem was still required after the crisis abated . Thus , Taiwan , which because of its limited land area and dense population has developed unique intensive rice-farming techniques , stepped forward to play a major role in bringing about a kind of " green revolution . "  
As they stand in front of you , the color of their skin and nationality seems no longer to make any difference , and what becomes apparent is that Evergreen 's strong corporate culture-that " green " spirit with which the firm is so associated in Taiwan-is reverberating here in an exotic land on the other side of the world .  
In contrast with today , when wild ducks live on river beds choked with stinking organic chemicals and strewn with styrofoam and other plastics , in written records from the past the ducks suck up red algae , delve beneath green lotus leaves , wash themselves with dew and live among clouds and mists .  
Wang Bo , who loved to write about ducks , mentions in a fu ( a piece of descriptive prose interspersed with verse ) how southeast of Zizhou in Sichuan , the Fu River ran through a pool only a few dozen paces around-a hidden place of green cliffs and splashing waves , where lone ducks often settled on the waters , flying up , sinking down , turning and quacking , quite in keeping with their nature .  
Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon . Their almond-shaped pupils , which change shape in shifting light , are eerie enough , without even considering that their eyes may give off a green luminescence ( from reflected light ) . And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
From the memories of old family members and from old photographs , one can reconstruct the exquisite scene of former times : at dawn the dense mist hanging over the seven pools enshrouds the surrounding paddy fields , but as the first rays of sunshine strike through , one sees the Li Family Compound , built of bricks and stone , standing sturdy among the expanse of green . This is why the local nickname for this great house was " Beauty in the Fields . "  
But most modern people instead consume great amounts of fish , meats , and fast food , and have long forgotten that there are many edible things in nature that are rich in nutrients . These green leafy vegetables can all provide vitamin C , iron , folic acid , and calcium .  
We even proposed that during that week , gays and supporters of gay rights in Taiwan wear a different color each day-red , orange , yellow , green , blue and purple-over six days , to express the expectations represented in the gay rainbow banner for peaceful dignity and equal respect . "  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
Earth Lord temples can often be found amid lush green expanses of paddy-field , watching over the crops and blessing them with healthy growth . P The tutelary god known as " Earth Lord " has become a bit of a celebrity of late , showing up in various TV series with his beaming smile and long white whiskers , his trademark magic ingot and ruyi scepter in hand , helping out hapless victims of mistreatment .  
The bushy eyebrows are " dyed " a deep green , the large eyes are accented with a deep-blue eye shadow , the lips are painted red , and the ears are pierced .  
A further key element of the counter-pornography policy is the TV classification system introduced in January this year , similar to movie classifications , in which programs are graded and color-coded according to content : red for " restricted , " yellow for " parental guidance , " blue for " protected " and green for " general audience . "  
The recyclers also tipped the waste liquid from their acid baths into the nearby Erhjen Creek , turning its waters black and giving rise to the notorious " green oyster incident . "  
After we passed through the city of Konosu , the scenery became very rural , with rice fields on either side of the road . Farmhouses dotted the landscape , rice seedlings were planted in neat rows in flooded paddies , wisteria vines were sprouting their first tender green leaves of spring , and eager tips of grass were just beginning to push up through the sleepy spring soil .  
Hung out in front of many of the farmhouses were brightly colored carp streamers , with the carp 's golden scales glittering against backgrounds of black , red , blue , purple , green , orange . . . . The gay streamers fluttering in the breeze against a wide open sky only intensified the feeling of spring in the air .  
It must also be remembered that DPP party members are the chief executives in the large majority of Taiwan 's cities and counties . Now that the DPP also controls executive power at the central level , the political map will have a green line running from localities to the center .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
To portray a scene of verdant , mist-shrouded mountains in ceramic painting , it is necessary to use underglaze painting in combination with certain fluid , translucent glazes of brown and green . When fired , these glazes can produce a hazy effect which even ink and paper can not match .  
When one talks of Chinese architecture , what people are probably most familiar with is multi-layered dougong block-and-bracket structures under flying eaves , and vermilion pillars supporting square-paneled " caisson " ceilings painted with dragon-and-phoenix designs in gold , green and a rainbow of other colors-the " palatial " style .  
An important step in this painting process is adding fine white lines between the different strong colors-red , yellow , blue , green and gold-to make them appear more harmonious and less gaudy .  
From halfway up the mountain , the entire valley is visible . Looking up , one sees birds of prey circling . The dead acacia stands erect in the midst of a green forest halfway up the slope . When the wind blows , it exposes the silver back side of the leaves of the surrounding trees , and the dead acacia stands out still more clearly .  
" The biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says Tsao Chi-hung . " As more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . " The riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the East , the sunset in the West , and the dreamy river alongside the park .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water . Whether sold domestically or exported , Pinglin 's Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels . Both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90% of the people of Pinglin , life revolves around tea .  
Two decades later , the Japanese botanist Fukuyama Noriaki also collected pleiones from Mt . Hsiakalo in Hsinchu . This time the flowers were a pure , snowy white , and the onion-like bulbs were a glistening green color , unlike the previously discovered purple bulbs . Overjoyed at his discovery , Fukuyama named this new variety the snow-white pleione ( Pleione formosana var . nivea ) .  
In this showdown between political organizations , the ambitions and maneuverings of the most prominent party aristocrats are also getting considerable exposure . Looking at the structure of Taiwan 's voting population , at bottom the ratio of 60% blue vs . 40% green is quite firmly established , and parties on both sides are finding it difficult to make inroads into the other camp .  
" Let me take you soaring over a stretch of green fields / Piercing a tunnel of greenery bathed in the setting sun / Let the cool breeze and the fragrance of oranges run through your fingers / Cast off your worries and let your mind go free . The great peak beckons to me with a gesture / The secondary peak nods in my direction / The mountain coffee sends your troubles packing / The winding highland roads call : Hurry up and get started ! "  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
In addition to a trade function , agriculture performs roles in maintaining food security , in travel and leisure , maintaining a green environment , and even the social function of absorbing the unemployed . Agriculture offers many " side benefits " that can not be measured in terms of income . With the exception of a very few city states , no country , including those considered agriculturally viable , such as the US , Canada , Australia , and New Zealand , dares neglect the intangible values of agriculture .  
Take , for instance , Tuniu Elementary School in Shihkang , Taichung County . It has a sloping red roof ; exposed azure pipes ; blue , purple and yellow outer walls for the classroom buildings ; peach floors ; red and green stairwells ; dark blue pillars in the corridors ; green railings ; and picture windows that cover one-third of the walls . Vibrant color and striking moving lines are the dominant aesthetic . Paradise next to rice paddies  
When you visit Kinmen , everywhere you can see old villages with their houses neatly lined up on a north-south axis . Civilian residences preserving traditional Fujianese architecture form tight little knots . Red tiles , stone walls , and elegant " swallow-tail " roof ridges bounce sunlight off the fresh green fields , creating a leisurely ambience of small-island warmth and security .  
Tungting oolong , on the other hand , because the tea sprouts are soft and plump , and the brewed tea has a more robust dark green color , a richer fragrance , and a more full-bodied flavor , is likened to a newly married woman , mature yet tender and delicate .  
The work has and will stand the test of time because of its clever design that utilizes the original splendid coloration ( a mixture of white and green ) and the remarkable carving that rendered a piece of jade into a life-like cabbage with two katydids on top of it . The work , however , also shows jade carvings ' traditional limitations .  
Take , for instance , The Myriad Poses of Ants . The large black ants common to Taiwanese fields are seen scurrying on top of a piece of bamboo , transporting food . Every ant has a different pose , and the dark green sheen of Taiwan jade gives the bamboo a great vibrancy . When you look close , the ants almost appear to be breathing .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
According to Wu Tse-jui from Meishan , preparing Mt . Ali tea for the market involves precise planting , careful selection , gentle rolling , and slow baking , especially for unfermented green tea .  
In mid April , the usually inky green , stiff and subdued Formosan rhododendron undergoes a complete change of character , suddenly bursting forth in a riot of blossoms that range in color from white to pink .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
Strolling around the embassy compound , I discover new greenery amidst the flowers and grass , so parched and brittle just a short time before . The green and sour mangoes on the trees have been transformed instantaneously , becoming lusciously red and ripe .  
On an afternoon in June , " A Demonstration of Efforts to Reawaken Traditional Atayal Song and Dance " was being held at the Chinyueh Elementary School in Nanao Town . With the distant green ridges of the Central Range seeming to hold the locale in their embrace , the air was fresh , the flowers fragrant and the birds singing , as the communities of Chinyueh and Piyahaw , young and old alike , came out to roast meat and enjoy the performances .  
In emu eggs the layers are clearly distinguished . The outer layer is a deep fleckstone green , the middle layer a rich teal , and the innermost layer is pure white . This lends a great deal of depth to the carved works .  
Autumn maples stand tall along the roadside , with fields spreading out beside the highway , the different shades of green spreading out , one after another , into a single beautiful rustic landscape . White herons dotting the fields , the whole area flanked by winding mountain ranges , and dotted with elegant farmhouses and field walls built of rough-hewn stone ; all these illustrate the peaceful beauty of Sanhsing .  
Just as famous as their green onions are their sand leeks , although they can only be grown over the two or three months of winter . With the abundant rainfall of the plain , the leeks , too , grow large and well proportioned . Their scent is pungent and their flavor strong , which makes them well suited to the different styles of cooking around Taiwan , and for the past few years they have been a Chinese New Year staple throughout the Taipei area .  
On the vast Chianan Plain with its endless views of green rice paddies redolent with rice blossoms , Wu Ching , a teacher of fine carving , kneels on the ground , head bent and eyes intently scanning the earth beneath him . A line of ants are marching across the ground . It could be accurately stated that the ants are focused on their work and completely oblivious to Wu Ching .  
Having decided to use gold as his creative medium , Wu set to work , using 99.99% pure gold that lacked the silver or copper that goldsmiths traditionally add to make welding easier ( but that in time cause oxidation , with the silver turning black and the copper green ) .  
Chen Yu-cheng was the sole exception . Chen considered the school uniform-a yellow shirt with a green collar , a green necktie , and green shorts-to be " totally weird and ugly . " But its ugliness was not the only reason Chen refused to wear the uniform : " To my mind , it 's unreasonable for the school to force students to wear a uniform . "  
On the 24th day following birth , it was customary to place a chicken egg , stone , coin , and green onion in a basin of water , which was then used to wash and shave the baby 's head , signifying the hope that the child would have a face as smooth and beautiful as an egg , have a skull as hard as a rock , make lots of money , and be smart .  
Six months earlier , when the team of prospective climbers from subtropical Taiwan submitted their application , the authorities had misgivings because of the youth of the applicants . Later when they realized that the students had quite a bit of high-mountain experience and had received training for snowy regions , they gave the green light .  
The man responsible for this is Liang Kuo-kuo , head of the Planning Department of the Taipei City Traffic Bureau 's Traffic Engineering Office . Hsinyi District is fairly big , says Liang , and the cycle lanes head along the " green belt " planned for each side of the district . The lanes pass along Sungkao Rd . , Sungchi Rd . , Sungjen Rd . and Sungteh Rd . , covering a total of 10.5 kilometers , and allow the public to ride along a shaded area and enjoy a bit of fresh air .  
An approach to marine pollution prevention " , GESAMP Report and Studies , No . 30 , 1986 .  Heavy trawls may be considered " green " on deep muddy grounds but " red " in shallow estuaries and coastal zones or coral reefs .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
In order to achieve essential food security , overcome the structural constraints inherent in current agricultural practices and better exploit existing potential , a new green revolution should be fostered to bring about both a massive improvement in water resources management and a major increase in the irrigation of arable land and in the application of scientific techniques to agricultural production ;  
These raise the ability of the population to work which , as historical studies have confirmed , can be a major source of growth .  33 / If technological advances along the lines of the Asian green revolution and the development of markets lead to sustained agricultural gains in Africa , a more optimistic outlook for the continent would be justified .  
Below the 75-ft ( 22.86 m ) high base of the shallow dome , wood-slatted panels , interrupted by a wash of gold from ceiling to podium , descend against the outwardly tilted wall to the blue and green decor of the 165-ft ( 50.29 m ) long by 115-ft ( 35.05 m ) wide Hall .

In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .
