As a customs head , Zhao Yucun used the powers in his hands to help set up a public bonded warehouse and approved the purchase of confiscated contraband goods , to pursue vast illegal profits for smugglers , and even directly got them off the hook for their lawless activities and acted as their umbrella , while taking huge bribes himself and amassing a great deal of ill-gotten money and goods , with the result that the state suffered huge economic loss .  
Even the present conviction for illegal handling of classified information and the nine-month prison term are excessive because similar practices are rather common in major scientific research institutions and government organs in the United States , and the overwhelming majority of the handlers would get away unscathed or with disciplinary sanction .  
In order to realize their ulterior political motives and ambitions , cults often make use of loopholes in state laws and social administration policies .  Under the cloak of religious cultivation or physical exercise , they set up very strict internal interdictions and taboos and establish among their followers illegal and rigidly stratified organizational structures in an attempt to form " secret kingdoms " based on " religious belief " outside the framework of a legal society .  
A large number of facts can prove that this organization of " Falungong " is totally a cult organization opposing the government and the people .  They organized and incited a series of illegal activities , thus openly provoking the socialist country , democracy , and legal system , and endangering national security and social stability .

Because the profits gained through smuggling of illegal immigrants are equivalent to or exceed the huge profits gained through drug trafficking activities , with annual profits reaching more than $ 1 billion , international criminal cliques have spared no efforts to rush into the danger . 
Through initial investigations , it is believed that the [ incident of ] illegal immigrants hiding inside the container discovered by Hong Kong authorities this time was arranged by international criminal cliques .  They first went to Guangzhou from Fujian , then they entered Hong Kong in groups with round trip permits .  
Under such circumstances , international criminal cliques have adopted more concealed and roundabout smuggling tactics .  For example , the illegal immigrants captured by Hong Kong this time were arranged by criminals in Hong Kong . They falsely reported the material inside the containers .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out : The problems such as illegal immigration , sneaky intrusion into other countries , and so on exist in many countries , which is the transnational crime committed by international criminal groups and must be cracked down on with joint efforts .

Third , in terms of specific administrative platforms , even though neither Bush nor Gore has something extraordinary that appeals to people , Bush 's call for comprehensive tax cut , general amnesty for illegal immigrants , strengthening America 's role in international affairs , and building national defense has received support from many voters .

Talking about the relationship between handling Falungong and guaranteeing human rights , Liu said : The policy of the Chinese government in handling the Falungong problem is to unite with , educate , and saving most of the practitioners who have been deceived .

Where the shop operators are prosecuted under section 4A of Cap . 228 , they are generally only required to pay a fine of about $ 400 .

( b ) We have reasons to believe that those who use forged ( green cards ) are mostly illegal workers .  This is because a worker may be issued a ( green card ) on the same day after completing a one-day basic safety training course and passing a test .  It is unnecessary for local workers to use forged ( green cards ) for working at construction sites .  
All fixtures were also cleared from the site .  The two arrested operators , including an 18-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman , were each charged with obstruction in a public place , illegal hawking and cooking and heating food for the purpose of hawking without a licence .

A number of District Council ( " DC " ) members have reflected to me that , subsequent to their complaints to the relevant government departments about local problems , such as gambling at public places , illegal on-street parking and illegal hawking , they or their offices had fallen victim to harassment .  They suspect that this is due to their identity as complainants being divulged by the law enforcement officers concerned .

Dr Ho pointed out that the primary objective of authorising football betting was to combat the growing problem of illegal football gambling by diverting existing demand for football betting into a regulatory channel .  
" The licensing conditions seek to strike a reasonable balance between the need to ensure the competitiveness of authorised football betting against its illegal counterparts locally and round the world ; and the need to put in place an adequate regulatory system in order to minimise any negative impact on the community , " Dr Ho remarked .  
Since terrorists deploy ' reverse money laundering ' techniques , by using money obtained legally for illegal acts , and launder small amounts of ' clean money ' so it can be used for ' dirty ends ' , it is obvious that traditional methods to track down funds are no longer adequate , and that heightened vigilance by financial institutions is vital .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
In the September issue of Life Magazine , a five-page feature story attacked the alleged profusion of counterfeit manufacturers operating out of the Republic of China . This article was later followed by two successive stories which appeared in Newsweek and the Asia Magazine respectively . Describing Taiwan as a " haven " for illegal manufacturing piracy , the reports seemed to imply that the nation was the leading culprit in this rampant international affliction .  
The time-honored idea that while counterfeits may be illegal , imitations are harmless , combined with today 's advanced technology , has resulted in a confusing jumble of the spurious and the authentic . Distinguishing the genuine from the fake is a problem of prime importance for collectors and investors in Chinese art . "  
The Bureau of Entry and Exit in the Ministry of Interior Affairs has decided in principle to verify entry and exit permits by the method of computer barcodes instead of the visual verification system currently in effect in order to facilitate the entry and exit of compatriots from mainland China coming to Taiwan to attend funerals or visit ailing relatives as well as the entry and exit of the general public and to better guard against the surreptitious exit of economic criminals and other illegal elements from the country .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
In order more effectively to close off illegal channels for the entry into Taiwan of chameleons , wa-wa-yu ( Chinese salamanders ) , and other wild animals from mainland China , the Council of Agriculture in the Executive Yuan has decided that all wild animals brought into the country by travelers will be reported to the Japan chapter of the international Special Commission for Investigating Trade in Wild Plants and Animals , which in turn will notify the countries of export so that the exporters involved may be strictly apprehended .  
The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
The Taiwan Straits may seem calm , but there is an unseen and turbulent undercurrent . The naval vessels that cruise these rough waters are in the front line in more than one sense . Externally , they face mainland forces that are ten times numerically superior to our own , and the threat from nearly one hundred submarines , as well as the worsening problems of smuggling and illegal entry . On the domestic front the navy is going through a transition period , with aging vessels being decommissioned and manpower reduced .  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
Its administrative district was Taipei City , and in neighboring communities just across the bridge , an inch of land was already worth an inch of gold . But the ban on new development caused reluctance to proceed without construction of public works . Disordered , illegal constructions and dilapidated old red brick structures with leaky roofs are everywhere .  
In the conservative period of martial law , not only was the showing of violent films illegal , it was also not legal to publicly show most classic films because their " excessive sexuality is not fit for the national situation " or because they were considered politically sensitive . This left most classic film lovers no place to turn .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
Take Taipei as an example : Heavy traffic flows along the main roads and spreads out into narrow lanes which are full of parked cars and motorcycles ; real plans to give pedestrians more space are limited with expanded tiny sidewalks becoming spaces for illegal parking and crudely designed underpasses turning into dark , no-go areas .  
Feeling illegal : There are more mainland spouses here illegally who have n't been exposed by the media . Some of them may have married because they longed for Taiwan 's political and economic stability or wanted to live here and could n't find a job back home or even because they fell into clutches of the white slave trade .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
The initiator of illegal radio programs - - " People 's Radio " - - received a legal frequency one and a half years after they transmitted their first program without permission . They have moved from the underground out into the open air . Admits Ho Ma-li , chief of the " People 's Radio " program office , " Underground radio station programs are easier . "  
The lawless traffic on the streets , the monotonous buildings , and the illegal and unregulated acrylic storefront signs fill the city with " dead " objects , leaving no space for anything humanistic . People feel annoyed and repressed just entering the city . " No wonder no one wants to go in , " concludes Hsu .  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
The government units charged with protecting species are weak , their funding limited , and their enforcement abilities lacking , and so the lists must put priority on those species facing pressures from hunting and international illegal trade in their parts : " They have the practical need of resolving pressing problems in society first . "

The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
It 's like getting addicted to coffee . Sure , the shows are n't very enlightening , and the kids are aware the shows are n't any good , but their emotions need a release . Sometimes they feel that the discussion today was really satisfying . " She does n't believe that topics should be taboo , but she does acknowledge that some hosts seem to be " walking on the edge , and if they go a few steps farther they 'll be illegal . "  
If the scope of liberalization is too broad , problems will result . If there is total liberalization , then future owners need not actually farm the land . Given that illegal use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes is already widespread , it would be almost impossible to regulate future use at all if land need not be owned by farmers themselves . Rampant speculation , a food crisis , or other severe problems might ensue .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Take for example illegal entry into the exclusive maritime economic zone to catch fish . Last May , the Taiwanese ship Tung Heng # 3 , which is supposed to operate only in the high seas , was painted red to give it the false appearance of a joint venture ship , and entered into the economic zone .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
And when Taichung police cracked down on illegal drinking establishments , one station focused entirely on the response of the bars ' " public relations girls , " running a six-minute report in which the camera spent most of its time aimed at the girls ' thighs and skimpy tops .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
The head of the team , Wang Chao-yi , points out that the high quality pebbles found underground in the Kuanyin alluvial plain have been disastrous as idle farmland has drawn illegal gravel mining , and the gravel pits have then been used as landfills , leaving behind a ravaged landscape . Since 1994 , residents of Paochang Village in Kuanyin Rural Township have been trying to protect the environment by blocking off coastal roads to gravel and garbage trucks . Unfortunately , new problems keep cropping up .  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
Some people say that the creatively designed workshop , with its curved sheet-metal skin , looks like an " outsize illegal structure " because of its uncanny similarity the unapproved additions that grace the roofs of buildings all over Taiwan , from the light steel frame to the corrugated plastic and metal roofing sheets , steel roller shutters , pinewood planks and plywood .  
What was involved was a strategy based on encouraging and provoking illegal emigration through the stirring up of discontent in the highest degree and the creation of conditions that were leading the country to a bloodbath .  
The representative informed the members of the Committee that , in April 1993 , the maximum period for suspension of a radio or television broadcasting permit , referred to in paragraph 28 of the report , had been increased from one year to five years .  Updating the figures contained in paragraph 45 of the report , the representative informed the Committee that , in 1992 , five persons had been convicted of agitating against an ethnic group , and two of illegal discrimination .  
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
Owing to the acute economic crisis , the State was unable to guarantee to a sufficient extent the protection of such inalienable rights as the right to work , the right to an adequate living standard and the right to housing or to protect the rights of many refugees and illegal immigrants in the country .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Adopting effective and environmentally sound national strategies to prevent or reduce substantially the cultivation and processing of crops used for the illegal drug trade , paying particular attention to national and international support for development programmes that create viable economic alternatives to drug production towards the full integration of the social groups involved in these activities ;  
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
The need to initiate legislative amendments to reduce the almost indiscriminate possession and bearing of arms that now exists , and increased control by the security forces over the illegal possession and bearing of arms and over the entry of unregistered weapons into the country , are considered fundamental aspects of this commitment .  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
On the contrary , through its implementation the Government has induced financial institutions to get to know their customers better and undertake a specific and direct surveillance of transactions in order to prevent their being used as instruments for the illegal concealment , handling , investment or use of money or other goods coming not only from drug-trafficking activities but from any other kind of criminal activity .  
In view of the special importance attached by ECO to the control of drug abuse and illegal trafficking , a comprehensive regional plan has been developed for implementation with the help of concerned international agencies and regional organizations .  
The Greek attitude and its reluctance in cooperation against terrorism ; the illegal Greek claim for 10-mile airspace beyond its 6-mile territorial sea , which is not recognized by the international community ; and the militarization of certain islands in the Aegean contrary to its contractual obligations under international treaties that placed these islands under demilitarized status are outstanding examples of the ostensible Greek claim for respect for international law and legality .  
There is no doubt , as we indicated in our previous letter , that the Iraqi regime is unaware of the scale of the human suffering caused by the illegal imprisonment of the Kuwaiti and other prisoners because that regime is itself responsible for the suffering of its own people , about which it is totally unconcerned , as is proved by the following facts :  
This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .  
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
This holds true for other United Nations operations , designed to render humanitarian assistance , where a propitious environment is essential and the safe delivery of goods and services to target populations the very purpose - too often threatened by disruptions and the illegal diversion of aid .  
Similarly on the point of occupation , the General Assembly concluded that , " in particular , [ the activities of ] the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) . . . aimed at achieving the integration of the occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative , military , educational , transportation and communication systems of the Federal Republic are illegal , null and void , and must cease immediately " .  
The United States of America , continuing to ignore the views of specialized agencies and the readiness of Cuba to establish a serious exchange of information on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality of States and mutual respect , had not halted its illegal television and radio broadcasts directed against Cuba , openly violating the most basic norms of coexistence and international law .  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;

Two United Nations reports on these tragic incidents state clearly that the responsibility lies with Turkey and the illegal Turkish-Cypriot regime , which used excessive and unwarranted force against unarmed demonstrators who were simply trying to remind the world that for 22 years Cyprus has remained a divided country whose people are still prevented by the Turkish occupation forces from returning to their homes and lands and from moving freely in their country . 
In keeping with the mutual respect for national sovereignty that is basic to international law , Papua New Guinea calls on all other States to refrain from statements and actions that send misleading signals to those who violate our laws ; to cooperate in preventing smuggling and other illegal violations of our borders ; and generally to prevent outsiders from interfering illegally in Papua New Guinea 's internal affairs .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever . 
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
It must be stressed that what we are dealing with here is not only hostile and provocative acts against the Republic of Cuba , as grave and illegal as they are , but also the fact that all the activities carried out by the so-called " Brothers to the Rescue " are violations of the standards which govern international civil aviation and may consequently endanger the lives and safety of many people and aircraft , which it is the fundamental obligation of the International Civil Aviation Organization to protect .  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestine women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
The recipients , selected among 106 nominees from Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean , eastern Europe and the CIS , focused their work on a wide range of topics , such as illegal arms and drug trafficking , money-laundering , organized crime , reform of the correctional system , juvenile delinquency , computerization of criminal justice information and crime prevention .  
The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .  
Croatia reported a total of 2,064 offences committed involving firearms in 1994 , including 135 murders or attempted murders , 28 cases resulting in serious physical injuries , 375 cases involving crime against common safety , 352 aggravated robberies , 420 cases involving illegal possession of weapons and 30 cases involving concealment of weapons .  
" Model guns " are toy guns made of metal that have forms similar to genuine handguns and that can be made into real guns .  In this context , " clean controlled delivery " involves secret replacement of an illegal handgun with a legal substitute .

The national law against the illegal smuggling of individuals into the country is embodied in the Immigration and Nationality Act , of which , the section entitled " Bringing in and harbouring certain aliens " , sets out criminal penalties , imprisonment and fines for the crimes of bringing or attempting to bring aliens into the country at other than a port of entry , transporting or harbouring undocumented aliens , and encouraging or inducing an alien to come to the country in violation of its law .  
As long as the United States authorities do not impose a complete ban on these illegal flights , and as long as effective steps are not taken to prevent them , the United States will be completely responsible for any future incident ; it will be violating the most elemental norms of international law and international civil aviation and will continue to fail to comply , in particular , with the most relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention and the Montreal Protocol .  
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
Undertake a far-reaching and comprehensive initiative which includes : ( i ) suspending the excessive granting to individuals of licences to carry firearms while measures aimed at severely restricting such activity are being enacted ; ( ii ) stepping up the efforts to impede the illegal flow of arms across the borders ; and ( iii ) issuing strict instructions to monitor the weapons of disbanded and inactive voluntary civil defence committees so as to prevent their transfer to similar organizations ;  
Ukraine is prepared to cooperate in the effort to combat terrorism , international organized crime , illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , explosives , poisonous substances and radioactive materials , and illegal transborder movements of persons , cargoes , goods and valuables ; in the effort to suppress crimes against persons and government property , and criminal offences in the economic , financial and banking spheres ; and in exchanges of convicted persons .  
I have the honour to inform you that under Article 35 , paragraph 1 , of the Charter of the United Nations , the Government of Burundi has decided to propose the convening of an urgent meeting of the Security Council to discuss the total and illegal economic blockade , which is in all respects contrary to international law , imposed by the States of the Great Lakes Region and the threat of an imminent arms embargo to the very severe detriment of our country and our people .  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
Often linked to other criminal activities such as the illegal arms trade , drug trafficking and money laundering , terrorism knew no boundaries , and no one State was safe against it ; effective and concerted international cooperation was therefore essential . 
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .  
I should like to mention by way of example the return of UNITA members to the National Assembly , which they left in 1992 ; the return of the expected total number of general officers to the Angolan Armed Forces ; the completion of the selection process of a total 26,300 UNITA military troops for induction into the Angolan Armed Forces ; the re-establishment of government administration , given the continued illegal occupation of certain areas of the national territory ; and the free circulation of goods and people in the areas under its control .  
The Serbian authorities are continuing their campaign of State terror through , to mention only a few forms , killing and torturing of Albanians , raids of homes throughout Kosova , illegal arrests and systematic persecution and maltreatment of political and human rights activists , imprisonment of people because of their political convictions , systematic and continued campaigns to destroy the Albanian cultural heritage , including by halting education in Albanian and crushing the efforts of the Albanians to preserve their identity in Kosova .

The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .  
Any church or place for religious assembly built and operated without authorization is liable to be closed and put under seal and those responsible for the " illegal " installation may be prosecuted , imprisoned and required to pay a substantial fine .

Having informed you of the foregoing , the Government of Iraq lodges a strong protest against it and publicly condemns the action taken by the team in unlawfully infiltrating Iraqi territory and engaging in an operation to collect security and intelligence information by illegal means and in a manner that is incompatible with the principles of good-neighbourliness , the Charter of the United Nations , the norms of international law and the 1926 Iraq-Turkey boundary agreement .  
The question of Palestine can not be resolved simply through the redeployment of Israeli forces , but only through complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from all the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including Jerusalem ; through the dismantling of the Israeli settlements , which have been declared illegal by the international community , as is evident in Security Council Resolutions 465 ( 1980 ) and 478 ( 1980 ) ; and through the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to sovereignty over their land and natural resources .  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
On behalf of the authorities of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been forced to leave their native place , allow me to express our deep gratitude to the United Nations , the Security Council and personally to you , Your Excellency , for the tireless efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia , Georgia , in particular , for the firm and clear position taken by the United Nations towards the illegal parliamentary elections held by the present separatist leadership on 23 November 1996 .

Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
PASHAYEV ( Azerbaijan ) said that drug abuse , illegal drug trafficking and crime were increasing at alarming rates and had serious political , economic and social implications for countries , particularly the newly independent States , which had been confronted with problems resulting from aggression , large numbers of refugees and displaced persons , economies in transition and a geographical situation favourable to drug dealers .  
Israel has continued to spread illegal settlements in the occupied territories , provoking in response deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Israeli citizens by frustrated Palestinians who see no hope in a peace process which has been in a state of prostration for more than a year .  
The prolonged cycle of violence and hostilities , as a direct consequence of Israel 's continued illegal occupation of Arab territories , has brought tremendous political , economic and social sufferings and hardships to the people of the region , including the loss of human lives .  
The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
The psychological effects of the Gulf war were still evident during these discussions and considerably complicated the task of approaching and understanding the question of migrant workers and that of the Bidun , who were variously described as undocumented persons , stateless persons and illegal residents . 
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .

This includes reaffirming that all legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel aimed at changing the legal status of Jerusalem and its demographic composition are legally null and void ; that Israeli settlements are illegal and represent a great obstacle on the road to peace ; that the plight of Palestinian refugees must be resolved through their right to return or through compensation ; and that the acquisition of territory by acts of war is inadmissible .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
Other important factors in many regions include illegal logging ; illegal land occupation and illegal cultivation ; grazing pressures ; unsustainable agriculture ; the demand for fuelwood and charcoal to meet basic energy needs ; refugee-related problems ; mining and oil exploitation in forested countries not conducted in accordance with appropriate national legislation ; and natural climatic events and forest fires .

It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
The fact that an unwarranted number of Arab dwellings had been declared illegal and been demolished by the Israeli authorities while , on the other hand , there appeared to be a de facto policy of encouraging the expansion of existing settlements and the creation of new ones had provoked a justifiable feeling of grievance .  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .

Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .

At the regional level , it establishes a permanent multinational task force , composed of national law enforcement officers from each party capable of operating across the borders to combat criminal activities committed in the illegal trade in wildlife .  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .

However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .

The exercise of power through the application of illegal means such as unilateral actions and the imposition of coercive economic measures against other countries in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives is the prominent example of an emerging unilateralism that is extremely arrogant and self-centred , that feeds on hegemony and expansionism and that entails serious interference in the internal affairs of other countries to the point of sabotage and subversion .

We also support the proposal to elaborate a comprehensive international legal instrument against transnational organized crime , which plays a central role in promoting illegal drug use and its attendant activities .

The analysis of the main trends and features of movements of toxic waste and dangerous products in the Special Rapporteurs previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights showed that , over the last decade , the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was tending to become a favourite target area for the illegal traffic in these products and wastes .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .

Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention .

The vast oceanic area under the control of our members is rich in fishing potential but requires careful management and monitoring to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing and other environmental threats .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
My delegation is equally concerned about the illegal and humiliating economic blockade that is being imposed on the Palestinian people , resulting in tremendous suffering and in financial losses amounting to several hundred-million dollars .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
A large number of these illegal immigrants are linked to organized international crime and terrorism , narcomafia , illicit trade in arms , human smuggling , juvenile crime and prostitution and are responsible for the criminalization of Kosovo and Metohija .  
Terms like ethnic minority , ethnic conflict , immigration restrictions , new immigrant , illegal alien , urban poor and colourblindness , are used to deny or obscure the racist aspects of certain social behaviours or government policies .

Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Secondly , clear definitions of terms loosely used in the previous report , such as illegal , legitimate , power and control , should be established in relation to the specific and unique political situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
Although the sanctions were designed to specifically target the illegal activities of Liberias elite , and not intended to harm the lives of ordinary Liberians , the report of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) has confirmed the bleak humanitarian situation of the population in Liberia .  
It is our conviction that the solution to the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly lies in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the additional protocols , as well as in the pertinent Security Council resolutions , which , once thoroughly observed , will provide the necessary conditions for a definitive settlement of the issues related to the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Congo in which the international community has a relevant role to play .  
While the Government of Burundi is satisfied by the conclusions of the Panel of Experts concerning charges pertaining to the alleged involvement of Burundi in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the delegation of Burundi is , however , concerned by information contained in certain paragraphs of the addendum regarding assistance granted to the armed groups Forces pour la dfense de la dmocratie ( FDD ) and Forces nationales pour la libration ( FNL ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
As the representative of Bhutan had said at the fifty-first session of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , it was of paramount importance to draw a clear distinction between genuine refugees and illegal and economic migrants motivated to leave their countries by the population explosion , environmental degradation and extreme poverty because , by devoting to them the slender resources available to it , UNHCR would merely encourage illegal immigration and deprive genuine refugees of the assistance they needed .  
In general , protection activities of COHCHR prevented illegal arrests as well as excessive detention , and facilitated victims access to legal assistance , release of victims in illegal detention , release of a significant number of adult women and minor girls from confinement and sexual exploitation , provision of shelter to several foreign victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and the arrangement of their safe and voluntary return to their home countries .

The increasing problems of organized crime , illegal trafficking , economic stagnation and political instability can be adequately dealt with only within a regional framework and with a unified international approach .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking ;  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Those realities were nothing more than the consequences of illegal acts which had gone unpunished and of the unacceptable partition imposed through the use of force and sustained by military strength in violation of every norm of international law ; they presupposed the constant denial of the individual and collective rights of 200,000 refugees ( more than a third of the Greek Cypriot population of Cyprus ) , who had been forcibly expelled from their homes since the Turkish invasion .  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;

The United States of America and the United Kingdom are committing acts of aggression and violating Iraqs airspace and territory on a daily basis on the pretext of allegedly enforcing the illegal and unlawful no-flight zones that were imposed by these two countries in a pathological display of military power that poses a threat to the security and safety of innocent civilian citizens and represents an assault on the sovereignty of an independent Member State of the United Nations .

I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
To adopt and implement , in the States that have not already done so , the necessary legislative or other measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the illegal manufacture , possession , stockpiling and trade of small arms and light weapons within their areas of jurisdiction , in order to ensure that those engaged in such activities can be prosecuted under appropriate national penal codes .  
By way of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , they have been continuing their military aggression against our people on a daily basis since 1991 by virtue of a unilateral and illegal decision taken by their governments in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
This illegal action , which was authorized by the Israeli high court , aims to alter the legal status and the religious and cultural character of Occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 . 
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .

Lack of , or inadequate , laws and labour standards and the illegal or semi-legal nature of the work formed the basis for forced , servile and exploitative working conditions , which varied from humiliating treatment , low payment and extreme working hours , to bonded labour or forced labour .  
We are fully aware of the close and complex link between terrorism , organized crime , drug-trafficking , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms and light weapons .

Iraq rejects all the flimsy excuses and pretexts stemming from this illegal decision that are used by these States in engaging in this hostile terrorist action in an attempt on their part to justify their military aggression against our country .  The logistic support made available by the governments of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Turkey to the United States and the United Kingdom , which includes the provision of air bases , has made them key partners in the terrorist aggression against Iraq , so that they bear international responsibility under international law .  
However , deregulation without accompanying measures , such as the establishment of professional bodies ( haulier associations ) to set professional standards and maintain discipline among members , could create a vacuum which could be exploited by unscrupulous operators engaging in illicit or illegal practices .

New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
We note with the deepest concern the close connections between international terrorism and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other deadly materials , as a paramount threat to international peace and security at the dawn of the new millennium .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .

The party and government have attached great importance to the harm of piracy in society , and General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji have given important directives on " eliminating pornography " and " cracking down on illegal publications .

The central leading comrades concerned personally convened a conference , laid out arrangements for investigating and handling the matter , and required that it be treated as an especially important case in centralized activities to " eliminate pornography and fight illegal publications " .  
" Eliminating pornography and fighting illegal publications " is a matter of social stability , of the physical and mental health of our young , of economic order , and of our international image .  The struggle needs to be looked at from a political point of view , and it needs a great deal of emphasis .  
In light of the rampant momentum of illegal publishing activities , in December 1998 , with emphasis from the central leading comrades , the Director of the Working Group on " Eliminating Pornography and Fighting Illegal Publications " , Wang Maolin , convened a conference attended by a dozen or so central organizations .  The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .

Party committees and governments as well as departments concerned in key areas seriously affected by illegal drugs should promptly swing into action to conduct careful investigation , make earnest arrangements , and adopt decisive measures to change the conditions of the localities within a specified time in accordance with the principles guiding the handling of the most serious problems of illegal drugs specific to the localities .  
Fifth , we must establish a sound mechanism of management to prevent administered and controlled narcotics , psychotropic substances , and precursor chemicals from entering illegal channels .  We must gradually establish an effective mechanism of management based on supervision , control , and cooperation among different departments .  We must continue to improve the import and export inspection mechanism based on cooperation of all departments concerned to ensure trouble free in the process of producing , marketing , transporting , using , and importing and exporting precursor chemicals .

They say the current society and laws must first be destroyed before they can preach their teachings .  On several occasions , Li Hongzhi issued " personal instructions " to practitioners , ordered them to lay siege to government organs and newspaper offices , engaged in illegal gathering and anti-government activities , and served as a pawn for foreign anti-China forces in a vain attempt to play a role that the western anti-China forces have failed to do .

In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .

A total of 1,695 raw and roast meat were seized .  
The TTF will focus its checks with the aid of intelligence and information gathered about the illegal importing and exporting patterns of certain illicit textile traders .  Any suspicious consignments and traders would be identified and appropriate measures will then be taken by the TTF or other investigative bureaux of the department .  This may include close surveillance on the activities of these illicit traders and transportation companies .  
The illegal factory , operating in a 150-square-metre temporary structure opposite to Lam Hau Tsuen at Shan Ha Road , was detected by a special task force of FEHD set up recently to crack down on illegal slaughtering and meat roasting activities . 
All fixtures were also cleared from the site .  All the five illegal cooked food operators arrested , two men and three women , were charged with operating unlicensed food factories and food preparation in open space .  They were each bailed out on $ 2,000 to $ 4,000 pending court hearing .  
The unlicensed food factory , located at a 300-square-metre temporary structure at the junction of Ma Sik Road and Tin Ping Estate , was detected by FEHD officers during a surveillance operation a few days ago .  After thorough planning , a raiding operation was mounted at 3 pm this afternoon to crack down on the illegal food business .  
( iii ) The HKPF and the Customs and Excise Department have informed their officers at the various boundary control points forthwith to pay special attention to those persons remaining in the vicinity of the control points and to intercept any suspected persons , so as to ensure that there is no room for unruly elements to conduct illegal activities , including departure without going through normal formalities . 
Meanwhile , another raiding team took actions at the same time and smashed another illegal meat roasting factory in the vicinity at Flat A3 at the rear portion of Block A . One men was arrested and charged with operating an unlicensed food factory and failing to keep the food factory clean .  
In half an hour , FEHD officers raided another temporary structure in Ma Tin Pok Tsuen and arrested a man who was engaging in illegal meat roasting activities on the premises .  He was subsequently charged with operating an unlicensed food factory and failing to keep the food factory clean .  
( b ) We have reasons to believe that those who use forged ( green cards ) are mostly illegal workers .  This is because a worker may be issued a ( green card ) on the same day after completing a one-day basic safety training course and passing a test .  It is unnecessary for local workers to use forged ( green cards ) for working at construction sites .  
All fixtures were also cleared from the site .  The two arrested operators , including an 18-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman , were each charged with obstruction in a public place , illegal hawking and cooking and heating food for the purpose of hawking without a licence .  An additional charge of possession of restricted food for sale was laid against the male operator .  
The Government had identified three possible options to tackle the problem of soccer betting .  These included : ( i ) updating the Gambling Ordinance to tackle cross-border gambling activities ; ( ii ) stepping up enforcement actions against illegal soccer gambling ; and ( iii ) providing limited regulated outlets for soccer betting .  
" The growing demand for soccer betting is now being satisfied through illegal and unauthorized means , thus leaving the local and offshore soccer bookmakers a huge market to serve .  
" We are determined to put a stop to such illegal food business to safeguard public health , " she said , noting that all the illegal cooked food stalls operating on the construction sites were demolished and cleared in the operation , with a total of 34 truck-loads of bamboo scaffolding , canvas , refuse and debris removed .  
The spokesman stressed that the department , apart from vigorous enforcement actions against illegal slaughtering activities , would continue to keep a close watch at the retail level through daily inspections to ensure that all pork sold for public consumption come from approved sources .  
The spokesman said , " the ImmD has always been watchful of the forging of the HKSAR passports and the using of forged travel documents and exerting maximum effort in combating this type of illegal activity .  The ImmD has periodically exchanged intelligence with the local and overseas agencies .  A Joint Investigation Team has been set up among the ImmD , the Custom and Excise Department and the OCTB of the HKPF . The operation is the foremost cross-territory and cross-agency operation of the Joint Investigation Team . "  
Since its founding in 1961 , the Immigration Service has grown from a small department to a major law-enforcement agency with some 5 600 staff .  It is committed to the provision of multifarious services to the public , which include issuing identity cards , birth certificates , marriage certificates and travel documents .  It is also responsible for exercising effective immigration control at our land , sea and air entry points , and combating illegal immigration , illegal employment and forgery activities .  
Commenting on the arrests of 53 people including 11 Police officers for suspected involvement in a number of alleged " staged arrests " at an illegal gambling stall in Kwun Tong during a joint operation by the Police and ICAC , a Police spokesman said that the Police will not tolerate any officers taking short cuts in enforcing legal powers or acting in anyway which may pervert the course of justice . 
The public was invited to express views on whether the Government should continue to maintain its existing gambling policy ; whether the Government should provide authorized outlets for soccer gambling as a means of tackling the illegal soccer betting problem ; and whether the Government should implement preventive measures and provide services to address the negative impact of gambling .  
The total number of illegal workers arrested has shown an upward trend as compared with the last three years .  Of them , those entering Hong Kong on Two-way Exit Permits have increased by 74 per cent when compared with the average monthly figure last year , following an increase of 19 per cent in 2001 and 34 per cent in 2000 over the previous yearly figures .  
Mr Ho added that if the directors or management of a company committed acts such as fraud or illegal transfer of assets or capital from the insolvent company to another company , this would have adverse impact on the subrogation income of the PWIF , as only a small proportion of the payment advanced to the employees could be recovered from the remaining assets of the employer .  
Under that , landlords might , in the absence of such provision in the tenancy agreement , apply for repossession before the tenancy expires on the ground that the tenant fails to pay rent within 15 days after the due date , uses the leased premises for illegal or immoral purpose , causes unnecessary annoyance , inconvenience or disturbance ( including persistent delay of rent payment ) or makes structural alteration to the leased premises without prior written consent of the landlord .  
A number of District Council ( " DC " ) members have reflected to me that , subsequent to their complaints to the relevant government departments about local problems , such as gambling at public places , illegal on-street parking and illegal hawking , they or their offices had fallen victim to harassment .  They suspect that this is due to their identity as complainants being divulged by the law enforcement officers concerned .  
The " Memorandum of Arrangement " enables contact points to be set up for direct exchange of information on air passengers and cargoes that are in transit , departing or bound for one of the two Airports and that are suspected or known to be connected with Customs offences such as illegal trafficking of narcotic drugs and smuggling of contraband .  
We have therefore decided to define the relevant activities more precisely to mean " illegal access " of protected information , which would only mean specified criminal acts , that is unauthorized access to computer by telecommunication , access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent , theft , robbery , burglary or bribery .  
" The Immigration Department , the Social Welfare Department and the Labour Department continued to conduct a joint operation to combat against illegal employment in elderly homes at Dills Corner situated in Kwu Tung , Sheung Shui . One foreign visitor suspected to have breached her condition of stay and in possession of a forged Hong Kong identity card was arrested , " a spokesman for the Immigration Department said today ( February 19 ) .  
Secretary for Home Affairs , Dr Patrick Ho , emphasised that the primary objective of the Bill is to provide an authorized and regulated football betting outlet as a means of tackling the problem of illegal football gambling in Hong Kong and to complement the vigilant efforts of the Police in combating illegal football gambling through law enforcement .  
The presence of domestic sewage and trade effluent in the communal drains there is probably caused by illegal expedient connections between individual private buildings and the communal drainage system , or by the direct discharge of wastewater into the drains at roadsides or back lanes .  
Six illegal cooked food hawking black spots in PHEs were identified under the Government 's Team Clean initiatives in improving territory-wide environmental hygiene .  A total of about 200 joint operations were carried out in these estates including Tai Wo Hau , Lei Muk Shue , Shek Lei ( I ) , Lower Wong Tai Sin ( II ) , Wah Fu and Lok Wah ( North ) .  
Dr Ho pointed out that the primary objective of authorising football betting was to combat the growing problem of illegal football gambling by diverting existing demand for football betting into a regulatory channel .  
" The licensing conditions seek to strike a reasonable balance between the need to ensure the competitiveness of authorised football betting against its illegal counterparts locally and round the world ; and the need to put in place an adequate regulatory system in order to minimise any negative impact on the community , " Dr Ho remarked .  
Since terrorists deploy ' reverse money laundering ' techniques , by using money obtained legally for illegal acts , and launder small amounts of ' clean money ' so it can be used for ' dirty ends ' , it is obvious that traditional methods to track down funds are no longer adequate , and that heightened vigilance by financial institutions is vital .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
In the September issue of Life Magazine , a five-page feature story attacked the alleged profusion of counterfeit manufacturers operating out of the Republic of China . This article was later followed by two successive stories which appeared in Newsweek and the Asia Magazine respectively . Describing Taiwan as a " haven " for illegal manufacturing piracy , the reports seemed to imply that the nation was the leading culprit in this rampant international affliction .  
The time-honored idea that while counterfeits may be illegal , imitations are harmless , combined with today 's advanced technology , has resulted in a confusing jumble of the spurious and the authentic . Distinguishing the genuine from the fake is a problem of prime importance for collectors and investors in Chinese art . "  
The Bureau of Entry and Exit in the Ministry of Interior Affairs has decided in principle to verify entry and exit permits by the method of computer barcodes instead of the visual verification system currently in effect in order to facilitate the entry and exit of compatriots from mainland China coming to Taiwan to attend funerals or visit ailing relatives as well as the entry and exit of the general public and to better guard against the surreptitious exit of economic criminals and other illegal elements from the country .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
In order more effectively to close off illegal channels for the entry into Taiwan of chameleons , wa-wa-yu ( Chinese salamanders ) , and other wild animals from mainland China , the Council of Agriculture in the Executive Yuan has decided that all wild animals brought into the country by travelers will be reported to the Japan chapter of the international Special Commission for Investigating Trade in Wild Plants and Animals , which in turn will notify the countries of export so that the exporters involved may be strictly apprehended .  
The criticism has been advanced that these fishing boats are the illegal mainland immigrants ' main means of support and represent their only capital , so that sending people back without their boat is tantamount to depriving them of their livelihood . Chou Chung-nan counters that most of the fishing boats involved in ferrying illegal mainland immigrants are worn-out and decrepit . Not many of them would be capable of making the voyage home , so there is a practical reason behind the policy of sending whole batches of deportees back on the same boat .  
The Taiwan Straits may seem calm , but there is an unseen and turbulent undercurrent . The naval vessels that cruise these rough waters are in the front line in more than one sense . Externally , they face mainland forces that are ten times numerically superior to our own , and the threat from nearly one hundred submarines , as well as the worsening problems of smuggling and illegal entry . On the domestic front the navy is going through a transition period , with aging vessels being decommissioned and manpower reduced .  
But in more than a few ways , cab drivers are also the object of criticism - - for refusing to ride short distances , for finding the longest distance between two points , for illegally raising fares during rush hour , for acting rudely , etc . And because it is easy for undesirables to become drivers , as public security has deteriorated , illegal behavior by a few drivers has tarnished the image of the industry . As the Chinese expression goes , " A single mouse dropping ruins the pot of congee . "  
Its administrative district was Taipei City , and in neighboring communities just across the bridge , an inch of land was already worth an inch of gold . But the ban on new development caused reluctance to proceed without construction of public works . Disordered , illegal constructions and dilapidated old red brick structures with leaky roofs are everywhere .  
In the conservative period of martial law , not only was the showing of violent films illegal , it was also not legal to publicly show most classic films because their " excessive sexuality is not fit for the national situation " or because they were considered politically sensitive . This left most classic film lovers no place to turn .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
Take Taipei as an example : Heavy traffic flows along the main roads and spreads out into narrow lanes which are full of parked cars and motorcycles ; real plans to give pedestrians more space are limited with expanded tiny sidewalks becoming spaces for illegal parking and crudely designed underpasses turning into dark , no-go areas .  
Feeling illegal : There are more mainland spouses here illegally who have n't been exposed by the media . Some of them may have married because they longed for Taiwan 's political and economic stability or wanted to live here and could n't find a job back home or even because they fell into clutches of the white slave trade .  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
But with the present lack of an overall system of control , conservationists agree with the Department of Health 's extreme step of a temporary complete ban on medicinal ingredients taken from protected animals ; otherwise the situation will arise where legal behavior will obscure illegal behavior .  
The initiator of illegal radio programs - - " People 's Radio " - - received a legal frequency one and a half years after they transmitted their first program without permission . They have moved from the underground out into the open air . Admits Ho Ma-li , chief of the " People 's Radio " program office , " Underground radio station programs are easier . "  
The lawless traffic on the streets , the monotonous buildings , and the illegal and unregulated acrylic storefront signs fill the city with " dead " objects , leaving no space for anything humanistic . People feel annoyed and repressed just entering the city . " No wonder no one wants to go in , " concludes Hsu .  
On the next outdoor shoot he was confronted with another group of indigenous people who were facing an even more pessimistic , miserable fate than the city 's construction site aborigines . They live in illegal buildings which are soon to be torn down . This time , he put aside his natural feelings of sympathy for his compatriots , and conducted his story carefully with a cool heart . Although still in a terrible mood , he shed no more tears .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
The government units charged with protecting species are weak , their funding limited , and their enforcement abilities lacking , and so the lists must put priority on those species facing pressures from hunting and international illegal trade in their parts : " They have the practical need of resolving pressing problems in society first . "  
Minister of Justice Liao , fully engaged in the campaign to crack down on illegal behavior in all areas of life , suggests that the Sung case shows the serious extent of the penetration of religious groups by criminal gangs ; this has already become part of his professional territory . Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian also announced a crackdown on criminally connected shrines to begin on October 15 .  
The judicial training center has lately increased the training it provides to prepare the judges in these areas , for example , taking the students abroad and having them tour legal gambling establishments ( all gambling is illegal in Taiwan ) and sex operations . In order to competently handle the traffic accidents which are more and more prevalent , the students must all learn to drive ; in order to combat the new styles of economic crimes , the aspiring judges must also make visits to securities exchanges .  
One senior reporter could not help but tremble when he heard this remark , because it hit home . He has grave doubts about the current domestic situation where " everything is political and the economy is at the service of politics . " In addition the influence of gangsters and big corporations is pervasive , and illegal activities thrive while those who obey the law are overly restricted . The competitive advantage that Taiwan ought to enjoy is sacrificed in the resulting confusion .  
It 's like getting addicted to coffee . Sure , the shows are n't very enlightening , and the kids are aware the shows are n't any good , but their emotions need a release . Sometimes they feel that the discussion today was really satisfying . " She does n't believe that topics should be taboo , but she does acknowledge that some hosts seem to be " walking on the edge , and if they go a few steps farther they 'll be illegal . "  
If the scope of liberalization is too broad , problems will result . If there is total liberalization , then future owners need not actually farm the land . Given that illegal use of farmland for non-agricultural purposes is already widespread , it would be almost impossible to regulate future use at all if land need not be owned by farmers themselves . Rampant speculation , a food crisis , or other severe problems might ensue .  
COA officials emphasize that after the " Draft Revisions to the Agricultural Development Regulations " are passed , the primary task will be to do a complete survey to identify all current illegal use of agricultural land . At present , much vital farmland that is strictly prohibited for other purposes has in fact been misused . Observation of the principle of " agricultural use only for land zoned as agricultural land " must be rigorously ensured before restrictions on selling farmland are lifted .  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Take for example illegal entry into the exclusive maritime economic zone to catch fish . Last May , the Taiwanese ship Tung Heng # 3 , which is supposed to operate only in the high seas , was painted red to give it the false appearance of a joint venture ship , and entered into the economic zone .  
But the long-term problems caused by recreational facilities are not going to go away . These private facilities , in fact , existed long before the park was established . Many of them , such as Sun Moon Ranch , are known far and wide . They break the law in various ways , including using national land , building illegal structures , and operating without proper permits .  
It emerged that the Rey Lee Resort Hotel , which suffered severe structural damage in the quake , is actually an illegal structure , and its business license was revoked long ago . However , the owner had continued operating the hotel , leading to many guests being injured by earth and rock falls set off by the quake .  
Although hotel chairman Lin Shih-jung has already stated that under the present circumstances he has no choice but to close down the hotel , the incident has drawn attention to the illegal use of mountain slope land and to the issue of safety in the tourism industry . This in turn has raised concerns over the proposed construction of a hotel at Matsao in Yangmingshan National Park , since the intended site also lies on a seismic fault line .  
The chief culprit is suspected to be poor drainage at a disused military firing range on top of the hill . The Shihlin District Prosecutor 's Office is carrying out an investigation , and has not ruled out other possible causes , such as illegal logging , or that the drainage system for the whole area is inadequate .  
However , Chen Shui-bian 's iron fist in dealing with illegal video game arcades , the razing of illegal structures and actions against the sex industry and licensed prostitutes , as well as his constant disputes with the city council , led to growing opposition from interested parties and groups representing the disadvantaged . This in turn meant that many voters had reservations about the rough-and-tumble style of their first elected mayor .  
But most worrying are the fish farms spread all over Taiwan 's coastal regions . In some places , abalone pools have been dug into the marine erosion terraces , while in others illegal and excessive pumping of groundwater for aquaculture , along with extraction for domestic , industrial and agricultural use , has caused serious land subsidence in areas covering almost 1,000 square kilometers .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
And when Taichung police cracked down on illegal drinking establishments , one station focused entirely on the response of the bars ' " public relations girls , " running a six-minute report in which the camera spent most of its time aimed at the girls ' thighs and skimpy tops .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
The head of the team , Wang Chao-yi , points out that the high quality pebbles found underground in the Kuanyin alluvial plain have been disastrous as idle farmland has drawn illegal gravel mining , and the gravel pits have then been used as landfills , leaving behind a ravaged landscape . Since 1994 , residents of Paochang Village in Kuanyin Rural Township have been trying to protect the environment by blocking off coastal roads to gravel and garbage trucks . Unfortunately , new problems keep cropping up .  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
Some people say that the creatively designed workshop , with its curved sheet-metal skin , looks like an " outsize illegal structure " because of its uncanny similarity the unapproved additions that grace the roofs of buildings all over Taiwan , from the light steel frame to the corrugated plastic and metal roofing sheets , steel roller shutters , pinewood planks and plywood .  
What was involved was a strategy based on encouraging and provoking illegal emigration through the stirring up of discontent in the highest degree and the creation of conditions that were leading the country to a bloodbath .  
The representative informed the members of the Committee that , in April 1993 , the maximum period for suspension of a radio or television broadcasting permit , referred to in paragraph 28 of the report , had been increased from one year to five years .  Updating the figures contained in paragraph 45 of the report , the representative informed the Committee that , in 1992 , five persons had been convicted of agitating against an ethnic group , and two of illegal discrimination .  
The international community 's ability to offer a decent and secure existence to all its citizens is called into question by the numerous human tragedies , atrocities of war , terrorism , traffic in illegal drugs and long-term ecological degradation of our planet .  It is self-evident that global cooperation and effective action is a sine qua non for effectively combating these and other evils tormenting world society .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
Those Governments that are thus accused of failure to live up to international humanitarian standards are subjected to unilateral arms embargoes imposed on them by the arms - exporting countries , whereas the perpetrators of violence who procure their weapons , perhaps from the very same sources , are never held accountable for their illegal and destabilizing activities .  
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
Owing to the acute economic crisis , the State was unable to guarantee to a sufficient extent the protection of such inalienable rights as the right to work , the right to an adequate living standard and the right to housing or to protect the rights of many refugees and illegal immigrants in the country .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Organized crime , illegal drugs , illicit arms trade , trafficking in women and children , ethnic and religious conflict , civil war , terrorism , and all forms of extremist violence , xenophobia , politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order .  
Adopting effective and environmentally sound national strategies to prevent or reduce substantially the cultivation and processing of crops used for the illegal drug trade , paying particular attention to national and international support for development programmes that create viable economic alternatives to drug production towards the full integration of the social groups involved in these activities ;  
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
The need to initiate legislative amendments to reduce the almost indiscriminate possession and bearing of arms that now exists , and increased control by the security forces over the illegal possession and bearing of arms and over the entry of unregistered weapons into the country , are considered fundamental aspects of this commitment .  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
On the contrary , through its implementation the Government has induced financial institutions to get to know their customers better and undertake a specific and direct surveillance of transactions in order to prevent their being used as instruments for the illegal concealment , handling , investment or use of money or other goods coming not only from drug-trafficking activities but from any other kind of criminal activity .  
In view of the special importance attached by ECO to the control of drug abuse and illegal trafficking , a comprehensive regional plan has been developed for implementation with the help of concerned international agencies and regional organizations .  
The Greek attitude and its reluctance in cooperation against terrorism ; the illegal Greek claim for 10-mile airspace beyond its 6-mile territorial sea , which is not recognized by the international community ; and the militarization of certain islands in the Aegean contrary to its contractual obligations under international treaties that placed these islands under demilitarized status are outstanding examples of the ostensible Greek claim for respect for international law and legality .  
There is no doubt , as we indicated in our previous letter , that the Iraqi regime is unaware of the scale of the human suffering caused by the illegal imprisonment of the Kuwaiti and other prisoners because that regime is itself responsible for the suffering of its own people , about which it is totally unconcerned , as is proved by the following facts :  
This year , the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations which coincides with the twentieth anniversary of the illegal invasion of East Timor the question of East Timor is increasingly attracting worldwide attention , not only as a basic human rights issue but also , first and foremost , as a question of restoring the rights of a small colonial people , allowing it freely to choose its future political status .  
These include the acute crisis in the Balkans , the smouldering Cypriot problem , unresolved differences between Turkey and Greece , the periodic flare-up of tension in the Middle East , the uncertain situation regarding the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya , illegal migration , the growth of religious violence , which feeds on the alarming disparities between rich and poor in individual countries , and on lagging economic development in various States .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
This holds true for other United Nations operations , designed to render humanitarian assistance , where a propitious environment is essential and the safe delivery of goods and services to target populations the very purpose - too often threatened by disruptions and the illegal diversion of aid .  
Similarly on the point of occupation , the General Assembly concluded that , " in particular , [ the activities of ] the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) . . . aimed at achieving the integration of the occupied territories of Croatia into the administrative , military , educational , transportation and communication systems of the Federal Republic are illegal , null and void , and must cease immediately " .  
The United States of America , continuing to ignore the views of specialized agencies and the readiness of Cuba to establish a serious exchange of information on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality of States and mutual respect , had not halted its illegal television and radio broadcasts directed against Cuba , openly violating the most basic norms of coexistence and international law .  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Two United Nations reports on these tragic incidents state clearly that the responsibility lies with Turkey and the illegal Turkish-Cypriot regime , which used excessive and unwarranted force against unarmed demonstrators who were simply trying to remind the world that for 22 years Cyprus has remained a divided country whose people are still prevented by the Turkish occupation forces from returning to their homes and lands and from moving freely in their country . 
In keeping with the mutual respect for national sovereignty that is basic to international law , Papua New Guinea calls on all other States to refrain from statements and actions that send misleading signals to those who violate our laws ; to cooperate in preventing smuggling and other illegal violations of our borders ; and generally to prevent outsiders from interfering illegally in Papua New Guinea 's internal affairs .  
Secondly , I should like to avail myself of this opportunity to remind the international community that my country is suffering from an inhuman , illegal and unjust economic blockade imposed by the neighbouring States under a pretext involving my country 's domestic policies a question that has already become nugatory .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic declares that the recent step taken by the Republic of Armenia in signing the aforementioned agreement with the illegal entity established in the Nagorny Karabakh region of the Azerbaijani Republic which is occupied by the Republic of Armenia constitutes gross and undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic and yet another infringement of the latter 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that it violates the universally accepted norms of international law and hence can have no legal force whatsoever .

It must be stressed that what we are dealing with here is not only hostile and provocative acts against the Republic of Cuba , as grave and illegal as they are , but also the fact that all the activities carried out by the so-called " Brothers to the Rescue " are violations of the standards which govern international civil aviation and may consequently endanger the lives and safety of many people and aircraft , which it is the fundamental obligation of the International Civil Aviation Organization to protect .  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous Israeli illegal settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestine women and their families , resulting from the frequent closure and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .

The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
Japan is of the view that , although it is necessary to consider the formulation of extensive and comprehensive measures , including the preparation of legal norms , in order to standardize the systems of Member States against organized crime , it hardly appears that there is currently an adequate common understanding among Member States regarding the actual pattern of illegal activity in question .

As long as the United States authorities do not impose a complete ban on these illegal flights , and as long as effective steps are not taken to prevent them , the United States will be completely responsible for any future incident ; it will be violating the most elemental norms of international law and international civil aviation and will continue to fail to comply , in particular , with the most relevant provisions of the Chicago Convention and the Montreal Protocol .  
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
Undertake a far-reaching and comprehensive initiative which includes : ( i ) suspending the excessive granting to individuals of licences to carry firearms while measures aimed at severely restricting such activity are being enacted ; ( ii ) stepping up the efforts to impede the illegal flow of arms across the borders ; and ( iii ) issuing strict instructions to monitor the weapons of disbanded and inactive voluntary civil defence committees so as to prevent their transfer to similar organizations ;

Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
The hostile actions of the United States represent a concrete example of organized State terrorism being committed against the people of Iraq by a major Power without regard for the humanitarian and material consequences that such illegal and unlawful actions may entail .  
Often linked to other criminal activities such as the illegal arms trade , drug trafficking and money laundering , terrorism knew no boundaries , and no one State was safe against it ; effective and concerted international cooperation was therefore essential . 
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation reiterated their support for the convening , in 1998 , of a special session of the General Assembly dedicated to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , trafficking and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and drug-related offences , from which new strategies should arise to tackle in an integral manner the problem of illegal drugs , and concrete mechanisms should be formulated for international cooperation for the fight against that phenomenon .  
I should like to mention by way of example the return of UNITA members to the National Assembly , which they left in 1992 ; the return of the expected total number of general officers to the Angolan Armed Forces ; the completion of the selection process of a total 26,300 UNITA military troops for induction into the Angolan Armed Forces ; the re-establishment of government administration , given the continued illegal occupation of certain areas of the national territory ; and the free circulation of goods and people in the areas under its control .  
The Serbian authorities are continuing their campaign of State terror through , to mention only a few forms , killing and torturing of Albanians , raids of homes throughout Kosova , illegal arrests and systematic persecution and maltreatment of political and human rights activists , imprisonment of people because of their political convictions , systematic and continued campaigns to destroy the Albanian cultural heritage , including by halting education in Albanian and crushing the efforts of the Albanians to preserve their identity in Kosova .

The Government of the United States of America , in giving illegal protection to Iraqis who have committed serious crimes against their country and to foreigners ( Americans and others ) and in introducing them into Iraq illegally in order to achieve illegal goals that jeopardize its security , stability , territorial integrity and political regime , is committing a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and an act of aggression against an independent Member State of the United Nations and is guilty of blatant interference in its internal affairs .

Having informed you of the foregoing , the Government of Iraq lodges a strong protest against it and publicly condemns the action taken by the team in unlawfully infiltrating Iraqi territory and engaging in an operation to collect security and intelligence information by illegal means and in a manner that is incompatible with the principles of good-neighbourliness , the Charter of the United Nations , the norms of international law and the 1926 Iraq-Turkey boundary agreement .  
The question of Palestine can not be resolved simply through the redeployment of Israeli forces , but only through complete withdrawal of the occupation forces from all the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 , including Jerusalem ; through the dismantling of the Israeli settlements , which have been declared illegal by the international community , as is evident in Security Council Resolutions 465 ( 1980 ) and 478 ( 1980 ) ; and through the exercise by the Palestinian people of their right to sovereignty over their land and natural resources .  
The United Arab Emirates , which welcomes the peace process on the basis of international law and the land for peace principle , considers illegal and inadmissible all current Israeli measures aimed at changing the demographic composition and the legal status of the occupied Palestinian and other Arab territories , including the city of Jerusalem , Syrian Golan and southern Lebanon .  
On behalf of the authorities of the Abkhazian Autonomous Republic and the hundreds of thousands of refugees who have been forced to leave their native place , allow me to express our deep gratitude to the United Nations , the Security Council and personally to you , Your Excellency , for the tireless efforts aimed at achieving a comprehensive political settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia , Georgia , in particular , for the firm and clear position taken by the United Nations towards the illegal parliamentary elections held by the present separatist leadership on 23 November 1996 .

Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
PASHAYEV ( Azerbaijan ) said that drug abuse , illegal drug trafficking and crime were increasing at alarming rates and had serious political , economic and social implications for countries , particularly the newly independent States , which had been confronted with problems resulting from aggression , large numbers of refugees and displaced persons , economies in transition and a geographical situation favourable to drug dealers .  
Israel has continued to spread illegal settlements in the occupied territories , provoking in response deadly terrorist attacks against innocent Israeli citizens by frustrated Palestinians who see no hope in a peace process which has been in a state of prostration for more than a year .  
The prolonged cycle of violence and hostilities , as a direct consequence of Israel 's continued illegal occupation of Arab territories , has brought tremendous political , economic and social sufferings and hardships to the people of the region , including the loss of human lives .  
The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
The psychological effects of the Gulf war were still evident during these discussions and considerably complicated the task of approaching and understanding the question of migrant workers and that of the Bidun , who were variously described as undocumented persons , stateless persons and illegal residents .

This includes reaffirming that all legislative and administrative measures taken by Israel aimed at changing the legal status of Jerusalem and its demographic composition are legally null and void ; that Israeli settlements are illegal and represent a great obstacle on the road to peace ; that the plight of Palestinian refugees must be resolved through their right to return or through compensation ; and that the acquisition of territory by acts of war is inadmissible .  
My delegation , therefore , can not accept any policies adopted or illegal measures taken by Israel in occupied East Jerusalem aimed at judaizing the city and changing its legal status and demographic character to advance its own political and strategic interests .  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , is applicable to the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographic and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Recalling also and concurring with the conclusions of and recommendations made by recent international conferences on the human rights of women and girl children , in particular with respect to the violation of those rights through sexual and economic exploitation for the profit of recruiters , traffickers and crime syndicates , as well as other illegal activities related to trafficking , such as forced domestic labour , false marriages , child marriages , clandestine employment and false adoption ,  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
Other important factors in many regions include illegal logging ; illegal land occupation and illegal cultivation ; grazing pressures ; unsustainable agriculture ; the demand for fuelwood and charcoal to meet basic energy needs ; refugee-related problems ; mining and oil exploitation in forested countries not conducted in accordance with appropriate national legislation ; and natural climatic events and forest fires .

The fact that an unwarranted number of Arab dwellings had been declared illegal and been demolished by the Israeli authorities while , on the other hand , there appeared to be a de facto policy of encouraging the expansion of existing settlements and the creation of new ones had provoked a justifiable feeling of grievance .  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .

Any person may take quick , expedient action to protect himself , as long as no other more appropriate judicial means exist , against any immediate or potential act or omission of public authorities or any individuals , harming , restricting , altering or threatening rights and guarantees recognized by this Constitution , by a treaty or by a law , in either an arbitrary or a manifestly illegal manner . . . .  
The Ministers also agreed to continue negotiations for the speedy signing of a trade agreement , an agreement on cultural and scientific cooperation , a protocol on the equivalence of educational qualifications and levels , an agreement on cooperation in the area of tourism , and an agreement on cooperation in physical culture and sports , and to draft an agreement on cooperation to combat illegal trafficking in drugs and other psychotropic substances .

The Parties have agreed to cooperate actively in combating illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , the smuggling of weapons and ammunition and of explosive , toxic and radioactive materials , organized crime , illegal migration and terrorism .  
Such policies constitute a flagrant violation of humanitarian law , international legitimacy and the accords concluded between the Palestinian Authority and the Government of Israel , as do the ensuing serious actions , including the expansion of illegal settler activities in Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967 , particularly in Jerusalem ; the expropriation of Palestinian lands and the demolition of houses ; resort to alleged security reasons in order to carry out measures of collective punishment ; and the imposition of an economic blockade .  
In this respect , the special session of the General Assembly devoted to international drug control , which is to be held in June 1998 , will provide us with an excellent opportunity to renew our political commitment by closing our ranks against illegal drug trafficking and striving jointly for progress in preventive efforts .  
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
The result of this deliberate inflexibility is the perpetuation of the illegal Turkish occupation of 37 per cent of the territory of the Republic by Turkish military forces , the artificial forceful separation of the two communities , the colonization of the occupied area by illegal settlers from Turkey , the refugee problem , the usurpation of the Greek Cypriot properties in the occupied area and the continued blunt violation by the Turkish side of General Assembly and Security Council resolutions .  
In India , for example , where the overwhelming proportion of the work force is engaged in the unorganized or informal sector which should not be confused with the illegal sector , as has sometimes been done the extent of unemployment or underemployment measured by the criterion of time spent at work is relatively low .  
In that statement baseless and unsubstantiated allegations were made against some regional States , including my country , to divert the attention of the international community from the illegal policies and inhuman actions of Israel , such as the continued occupation of the territories of others , including Al-Quds Al-Sharif , southern Lebanon and the Syrian Golan .  
Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
In July this year , earlier in this the tenth emergency special session of the General Assembly on the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the Occupied Palestinian Territory , my delegation emphasized , among other things , that it is not possible to divorce the complete nationhood of the Palestinian people from a just , comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East .

The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
At the regional level , it establishes a permanent multinational task force , composed of national law enforcement officers from each party capable of operating across the borders to combat criminal activities committed in the illegal trade in wildlife .  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
In order to protect borders effectively it is necessary for countries to enter into bilateral and mulitlateral agreements on transborder police cooperation to deal with organized or unorganized attempts at illegal migration ; set up an information support system for flexible cooperation between internal and external security forces ; train police officers and embassy staff regarding counterfeit documents ; and pay close attention to security aspects of the issuance of visas .  
On the basis of both kinds of information , the Commission might then consider devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and in practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .

However , illegal weapons do not have that protection , and their war-time use easily meets the rest of the definition of torture : their use causes severe pain and suffering , both physical and mental ; their use is intentional ; they are used to unduly coerce the enemy or the civilian population into surrender , submission or other state favourable to the user of the weapons ; and their use is under the direct order of public officials .  
Violations committed on national territory , most of which are considered to be justiciable offences , include : misappropriation of public funds , misuse of company assets , corruption , tax and customs evasion , financial speculation , fraudulent or unlawful enrichment , exploitation of illegal labour and migrant workers , etc .

In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
That occupation represented one of the ugliest forms of occupation in contemporary history , involving expansionist policies and practices , especially in East Jerusalem ; illegal Israeli colonial settlements ; usurpation and exploitation of Palestinian natural resources ; and the building of infrastructure separate from that available to the Palestinian people , all of which represented a unique mixture of colonialism and apartheid-like arrangements .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
Thus , four Governments considered that a conference could suggest ways of reducing or preventing forced or involuntary migration ; one Government was interested in reducing illegal migration , while another hoped that a conference might lead to the regularization of the status of illegal migrants ; and a further four Governments expected that a conference might contribute towards improving the management of migration so that it could be reduced , stabilized or even eliminated .

Despite the decision pursuant to the peace accords signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) and Israel to postpone discussion of certain items , including the matter of settlements , pending negotiations on final status , the illegal confiscation of Arab lands by the Israeli Government in order to build settlements was incompatible with the achievement by all parties of the common goal of economic and social stability .  
The exercise of power through the application of illegal means such as unilateral actions and the imposition of coercive economic measures against other countries in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives is the prominent example of an emerging unilateralism that is extremely arrogant and self-centred , that feeds on hegemony and expansionism and that entails serious interference in the internal affairs of other countries to the point of sabotage and subversion .  
At its sixth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice again discussed the smuggling of illegal migrants . 47 Members of the Commission noted that the smuggling of illegal migrants not only caused mental and physical harm and financial hardship to the illegal migrants , but also affected the social stability and bilateral relations of the countries involved . 
There are no regular standards established to gauge the informal economy , which has increased in all countries , and the illegal or illicit economy , which is based not only on drugs , but on contraband , arms and other categories .

We also support the proposal to elaborate a comprehensive international legal instrument against transnational organized crime , which plays a central role in promoting illegal drug use and its attendant activities .  
These measures , which were very hastily decided upon on 31 July 1996 , are unlimited with regard to their objective and duration and are illegal and unfair , added a series of misfortunes and suffering to the already pitiable drama caused by the civil conflict .  
Israel , the occupying Power , has committed yet another illegal and provocative action in occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of international law and relevant United Nations resolutions , and in blatant defiance of the international community .

Gravely concerned about the systematic terrorization of ethnic Albanians , as demonstrated in the many reports , inter alia , of torture of ethnic Albanians , through indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanian citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) by the police and military ,  
It includes the lack of response to acts of political violence but is also reflected in the almost daily reports of abuses by military and police officials against common people , including killing , rape , illegal arrest or kidnapping for extortion as well as beating and other violent acts .  
There is an enormous annual turnover in markets for illegal goods , such as illegal drugs , protected wildlife , stolen works of art , illegal firearms , and nuclear and / or toxic waste , as well as for trafficking in human beings .  
It was also important to find new ways of gauging international economic performance , not only by using formal economic indicators but also by measuring the informal and even the illegal economy in order to have a true measure of the global , or total , economy .  
At the regional level , judicial cooperation to combat terrorism , trafficking in drugs and weapons and other related illegal activities had been strengthened through the implementation of new bilateral and multilateral instruments for mutual assistance and exchange of information .  
It should be noted that , in this dispute , in which a number of workers were dismissed , workers who refused to stop supporting the ad hoc committee that had been set up or to renounce their intention to join the local union were prevented from entering the plantations , giving rise to declarations of illegal strikes and unwarranted dismissals , the verification of which revealed procedural irregularities .

An illegal act which violates human rights and which is initially not directly imputable to the State ( for example , because it is the act of a private person or because the person responsible has not been identified ) can lead to international responsibility of the State , not because of the act itself but because of the lack of due diligence to prevent the violation or to respond to it as required by the Convention .

Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
If not , the Security Council will impress upon the world public that the United States Government has abused the United Nations name to protect KLA terrorists , to cover up mass human rights violations and make possible the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo and Metohija , thus creating a state which is both illegal and untenable .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
Costa Rica , Croatia , Singapore and Togo noted that the same standard with regard to remuneration , conditions of work and terms of employment applied to foreign and national workers , with women migrant workers having the same rights with regard to job security , extended vacation , night and overtime work as national women workers . 15 Costa Rica provided comprehensive information regarding migration into its territory , including penalties for illegal migration .

Customs have a critical influence on development through the four major tasks they perform : ( 1 ) they are the physical " contact point " between the global and the national economy ; ( 2 ) they collect duties which represent a sizeable part of government revenue in developing countries ; ( 3 ) they are essential in the fight against the traffic in illegal products ; and ( 4 ) they gather trade statistics which are vital for policy-making .  
By working closely with States , UNHCR can ensure that the fundamental principles underlying its mandate and international instruments applicable in refugee situations will be upheld , and we can begin to reverse the disturbing trends of discrimination , xenophobia and closed borders on the one hand , while addressing issues of illegal immigration , trafficking and asylum abuse , on the other . 
In addition to discrimination , violence and poverty , Palestinian women faced the harsh oppressive reality of the Israeli occupation on a daily basis : the construction and expansion of illegal Israeli colonial settlements , the confiscation of land and water , and the recurrent closing of the borders of the occupied Palestinian Territory , which included Jerusalem .  
The daunting problems of illegal drugs , the lack of needed humanitarian support , human rights abuses , religious extremism and terrorism will not simply go away unless and until the international community is awakened to their combined effect on the peace and security in the region and beyond and starts paying full attention to the root cause - the civil war and foreign interference in Afghanistan . 
Israels ongoing policy of establishing settlements in the West Bank , including Jerusalem , and the other occupied Arab territories violated the resolutions adopted by the international community , which had declared those settlements illegal , obstructed a peaceful settlement , and were incompatible with the principles upon which the peace process was based .  
Calls upon the Government of Haiti to continue structural reforms in the police and the judicial system and the improvement of the prison sector , to investigate properly politically motivated crimes and prosecute perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law , to take vigorous action to eliminate any continuing human rights violations , including illegal arrests and detentions , and to ensure due process within a reasonable time ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo that affected ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of personnel of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
At its sixth session , the Ad Hoc Committee decided to devote the informal consultations to be held from Tuesday , 18 January , to Friday , 21 January 2000 , to the consideration of the additional international legal instrument against trafficking in persons , especially women and children , and the common provisions of that instrument with the additional international legal instrument against illegal trafficking in and transporting of migrants .

In view of the recent dramatic collapse of many regional fisheries and the deterioration of many economies based on fisheries , we are concerned about illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing also called IUU fishing especially by vessels which are not members of regional fisheries organizations or arrangements or by reflagged vessels owned by nationals of Member States .  
Because of their inability to adequately guard their maritime area , which is linked to their low level of technological development , the States of the zone are powerless to deal with harmful activities carried out in their maritime area , including the dumping of radioactive and toxic waste and illegal fishing , which is often carried out by vessels sailing under two flags .  
Furthermore , the holding in July of the Conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention provided an opportunity for the international community to reaffirm its support for this unarmed Arab people , who have been faced with repeated provocative and aggressive attacks , campaigns of displacement , land appropriation and the continuing and illegal colonization of its territory by the occupying Israeli forces .  
Yet all these efforts have been frustrated by hostile and aggressive actions taken by the occupying Power , which , far from showing itself ready to negotiate , has continued its policy of illegal settlements and violation of international law and human rights of the Arab people who live the bitter reality of living under occupation .  
Once again , the international community finds itself obliged to take action ; once again , Member States find themselves obliged to resume the tenth emergency special session in the face of Israel ' s intransigence and its insistence on continuing its illegal actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , in grave violation of international law , international humanitarian law and relevant United Nations resolutions .  
We are all aware of the grave repercussions of such illegal measures and the adverse consequences of making the whole region face an untenable situation , and our deliberations are being held to reject Israeli settlement policies which are aimed at altering the character , legal status and demographic composition of Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Concerned about the continuing difficult situation of Palestinian women in the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , and about the severe consequences of continuous illegal Israeli settlements activities , as well as the harsh economic conditions and other consequences for the situation of Palestinian women and their families , resulting from the frequent closures and isolation of the occupied territory ,  
To take strong and appropriate action , through the development and enforcement of specific legislation measures , against any kind of illegal , abusive or exploitative tourist activity , including sexual exploitation abuse , in recognition of the fact that such activities have particularly adverse impacts and pose significant social , health and cultural threats , and that all countries have a role to play in the efforts to stamp them out ;  
When the representative of the United Kingdom says that the subject of the illegal entry of non-governmental organization personnel into northern Iraq should be referred to the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) , which is responsible for implementation of Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and suggests that discussion of this matter should be held in that Committee , he can not be unaware of the nature of the Committee ' s work . 
Since all of these conditions have been met , the illegal , brutal and massive economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by the neighbouring countries should be lifted because the country is on the verge of suffocation and the suffering of innocent people is indescribable ; famine is imminent ; and diseases such as meningitis and cholera are epidemic due to a lack of medication .  
The first instance of the illegal entry of dangerous waste reported by the Brazilian authorities is that of four containers holding 68 , 332 kg of toxic wastes ( copper , zinc and other heavy metals ) which arrived in the coastal port of Santos ( State of So Paulo ) in December 1993 .  
Although , according to government sources , Costa Rica is still relatively untouched by the illegal traffic in toxic wastes , other people expressed their disquiet about the massive influx and intensive use of dangerous products , including agricultural chemicals , which constitute a serious threat to the environment , as well as to the life and health of persons who come into direct or indirect contact with these substances .  
The analysis of the main trends and features of movements of toxic waste and dangerous products in the Special Rapporteurs previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights showed that , over the last decade , the region of Latin America and the Caribbean was tending to become a favourite target area for the illegal traffic in these products and wastes .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
With reference to Paraguay , the Special Rapporteur points out that at the end of her visit to the country , she issued an appeal in which she stressed the importance of preventive measures at national , regional and international level in order to halt the illegal dumping of toxic and dangerous products , which is a serious threat to the rights of every individual to life , health and a healthy environment .  
If any costs are to be apportioned , they must be borne by all the parties concerned . 4 . All must respect the sovereignty , security and independence of Iraq in a responsible manner and must refrain from interfering in its internal affairs , first and foremost by eliminating the illegal no-flight zones in the north and south of the country .  
With a view to reducing existing or future opportunities for criminal organizations to participate in legal markets while acquiring illegal gains through activities such as illegal trafficking in motor vehicles , firearms , women and children and illegal immigrants , the States Parties shall take appropriate legislative and administrative measures , in particular :  
The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that a number of confirmed cases of illegal traffic in toxic wastes have not been solved in a satisfactory manner , either from the standpoint of the obligation to seek out and prosecute those allegedly responsible or of the duty to assist the victim countries in accordance with the principle of returning such waste to the country of origin , if known , or if not , to other States capable of managing it in an environmentally sound manner .  
Looking beyond START III negotiations , it seems clear to us that the prospects for negotiating deeper reductions would be enhanced if we have in place a dependable cap on fissile material for weapons , as well as confidence that the international community would detect illegal production.An FMCT also would help make nuclear arms reductions irreversible . 
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
Since 1993 , it is alleged that Liu Nianchun and others had planned to set up an illegal organization , provoked and disrupted public order by engaging in unlawful activities in Beijing , Shanghai and elsewhere .  
And for an archipelagic State like Seychelles , the aerial surveillance of its huge exclusive economic zone against foreign illegal fishing is much enhanced by good intra-island telecommunication services .  
The Government of Iraq , condemning in the strongest terms these official actions by the United States , the United Kingdom and Turkey as irresponsible and illegal , requests you to intervene directly with the Governments of these States and to urge them to desist from their persistent interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and to honour the Charter of the United Nations , which affirms respect for the sovereignty , political independence and territorial integrity of Member States .  
The laundering of money accruing from illegal drug trafficking , and the use of such money in order to finance illegal activities , such as providing financial support for armed rebel movements that threatened legitimate Governments , posed a threat to international peace and security and made it essential for the international community to cooperate with the relevant international bodies . 
Calls upon the Government of Haiti to continue structural reforms in the police and the judicial system and the improvement of the prison sector , to investigate properly politically motivated crimes and prosecute perpetrators of such crimes in accordance with Haitian law , to take vigorous action to eliminate any continuing human rights violations , including illegal arrests and detentions , and to ensure due process within a reasonable time ;  
Condemning the grave violations of human rights in Kosovo , affecting ethnic Albanians prior to the arrival of United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo personnel and troops of the international security presence , the Kosovo Force , as demonstrated in the many reports of torture , indiscriminate and widespread shelling , mass forced displacement of civilians , summary executions and illegal detention of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by the Yugoslav police and military ,  
The vast oceanic area under the control of our members is rich in fishing potential but requires careful management and monitoring to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing and other environmental threats .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
My delegation is equally concerned about the illegal and humiliating economic blockade that is being imposed on the Palestinian people , resulting in tremendous suffering and in financial losses amounting to several hundred-million dollars .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
A large number of these illegal immigrants are linked to organized international crime and terrorism , narcomafia , illicit trade in arms , human smuggling , juvenile crime and prostitution and are responsible for the criminalization of Kosovo and Metohija .  
Terms like ethnic minority , ethnic conflict , immigration restrictions , new immigrant , illegal alien , urban poor and colourblindness , are used to deny or obscure the racist aspects of certain social behaviours or government policies .  
APFIC reported that the issues concerning illegal , unregulated and unreported ( IUU ) fishing were widely recognized and were ongoing in the APFIC area , by both developed and developing fishing nations .  
The need for security is likely to increase as local police , advised by IPTF , have begun to undertake robust operations against local and international organized criminal groups involved in prostitution , drug trafficking and illegal migration .  
All this is accompanied by the establishment of illegal armed formations , blatant interference from abroad in the affairs of sovereign States and the creation of new hotbeds of tension , leading increasingly to the largescale loss of innocent lives .  
Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
It demonstrates that the false pretext of border insecurity is no longer tenable and that the real motive for the aggression is the systematic plundering and illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Secondly , clear definitions of terms loosely used in the previous report , such as illegal , legitimate , power and control , should be established in relation to the specific and unique political situation prevailing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in the region .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
Although the sanctions were designed to specifically target the illegal activities of Liberias elite , and not intended to harm the lives of ordinary Liberians , the report of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) has confirmed the bleak humanitarian situation of the population in Liberia .  
It is our conviction that the solution to the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly lies in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the additional protocols , as well as in the pertinent Security Council resolutions , which , once thoroughly observed , will provide the necessary conditions for a definitive settlement of the issues related to the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Congo in which the international community has a relevant role to play .  
While the Government of Burundi is satisfied by the conclusions of the Panel of Experts concerning charges pertaining to the alleged involvement of Burundi in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the delegation of Burundi is , however , concerned by information contained in certain paragraphs of the addendum regarding assistance granted to the armed groups Forces pour la dfense de la dmocratie ( FDD ) and Forces nationales pour la libration ( FNL ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
As the representative of Bhutan had said at the fifty-first session of the Executive Committee of the Programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , it was of paramount importance to draw a clear distinction between genuine refugees and illegal and economic migrants motivated to leave their countries by the population explosion , environmental degradation and extreme poverty because , by devoting to them the slender resources available to it , UNHCR would merely encourage illegal immigration and deprive genuine refugees of the assistance they needed .  
In general , protection activities of COHCHR prevented illegal arrests as well as excessive detention , and facilitated victims access to legal assistance , release of victims in illegal detention , release of a significant number of adult women and minor girls from confinement and sexual exploitation , provision of shelter to several foreign victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation and the arrangement of their safe and voluntary return to their home countries .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking .  
Particular attention should be paid by the discussions under both sub-themes to the position and special vulnerability of children who have been marginalized or discriminated against on the basis of their ethnic origin of economic status who can be , for example , singled out in schools for bullying or degrading treatment by teachers or be more vulnerable to violence within the family that escapes detection by the normal monitoring systems ( for example for families that are homeless or illegal migrants ) .  
The increasing problems of organized crime , illegal trafficking , economic stagnation and political instability can be adequately dealt with only within a regional framework and with a unified international approach .  
Those substances the abuse of which leads to a serious public health problem should be subject to more stringent measures ( involving prescription , dispensing , measures to combat illegal trafficking , withdrawal of medicines etc . ) at the local and international level in order to prevent misuse and illegal trafficking ;  
The Palestinian people continued to be subjected to the most gross , systematic and widespread violations of their human rights by Israel , which persisted in oppressing the Palestinian people and creating illegal de facto situations on the ground in an attempt to break the Palestinian peoples will and determination to realize their natural and inalienable rights , including the establishment of an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital . 
Those realities were nothing more than the consequences of illegal acts which had gone unpunished and of the unacceptable partition imposed through the use of force and sustained by military strength in violation of every norm of international law ; they presupposed the constant denial of the individual and collective rights of 200,000 refugees ( more than a third of the Greek Cypriot population of Cyprus ) , who had been forcibly expelled from their homes since the Turkish invasion .  
Further welcomes the commitment of , and encourages efforts by , the new democratic Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to investigate past abuses of human rights , including violations of human rights of individuals belonging to ethnic groups in Kosovo ; repression and harassment of peaceful political activists ; illegal and / or hidden detentions ; and other violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
The Panels recommendations revolve around six broad themes : ( 1 ) sanctions against countries and individuals involved in the illegal activities ; ( 2 ) preventive measures to avoid a recurrence of the current situation ; ( 3 ) reparations to the victims of the illegal exploitation of natural resources ; ( 4 ) design of a framework for reconstruction ; ( 5 ) improvement of international mechanisms and regulations governing some natural resources ; and ( 6 ) security issues . 
Reaffirms that the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War is applicable to the Palestinian territory and other Arab territories occupied by Israel since 1967 , including East Jerusalem , and considers any change in the geographical and demographic status of the city of East Jerusalem from its situation prior to the June 1967 war to be illegal and void ;  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Request States to make a serious commitment to adopting more appropriate measures to ( a ) combat illegal acts motivated by racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance against individuals , communities or groups of persons ; ( b ) protect victims of discrimination and provide them with security against future threats ; ( c ) punish those responsible for such crimes and violations of human rights ; and ( d ) make every effort to ensure that national and local public authorities act accordingly ;  
Urge States to design , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers who are victims of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and other related intolerance including , persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or be victims of illegal trafficking ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in preparing his analytical report on the progress made in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 55 / 188 of 20 December 2000 , to devote a separate section of the report to a global study on the illegal transfer of funds , especially funds derived from acts of corruption , and the impact of the illegal transfer of funds on economic , social and political progress , in particular in developing countries ;  
The United States of America and the United Kingdom are committing acts of aggression and violating Iraqs airspace and territory on a daily basis on the pretext of allegedly enforcing the illegal and unlawful no-flight zones that were imposed by these two countries in a pathological display of military power that poses a threat to the security and safety of innocent civilian citizens and represents an assault on the sovereignty of an independent Member State of the United Nations .  
Evidence of such [ incompetence ] [ negligence ] may include failing to perform the duties assigned to the insolvency representative , engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities , or causing excessive monetary loss .  
Moreover , a genuine operation is under way to influence world opinion in order to accomplish unacknowledged goals : continuing to occupy Congolese territory , massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , pillage and illegal exploitation of Congolese resources .  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
Urges States to design or reinforce , promote and implement effective legislative and administrative policies , as well as other preventive measures , against the serious situation experienced by certain groups of workers , including migrant workers , persons of migrant origin and foreign workers , who are vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including persons involved in prostitution and others who may be exploited or victims of illegal trafficking .  
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
To adopt and implement , in the States that have not already done so , the necessary legislative or other measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the illegal manufacture , possession , stockpiling and trade of small arms and light weapons within their areas of jurisdiction , in order to ensure that those engaged in such activities can be prosecuted under appropriate national penal codes .  
By way of the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq , they have been continuing their military aggression against our people on a daily basis since 1991 by virtue of a unilateral and illegal decision taken by their governments in flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
This illegal action , which was authorized by the Israeli high court , aims to alter the legal status and the religious and cultural character of Occupied Jerusalem , in flagrant violation of relevant Security Council resolutions and the fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 . 
It is the States inability to safeguard human rights that has made the public feel defenceless and has increased tolerance for illegal , increasingly violent phenomena such as lynchings and social cleansing .  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
Lack of , or inadequate , laws and labour standards and the illegal or semi-legal nature of the work formed the basis for forced , servile and exploitative working conditions , which varied from humiliating treatment , low payment and extreme working hours , to bonded labour or forced labour .  
We are fully aware of the close and complex link between terrorism , organized crime , drug-trafficking , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms and light weapons .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
Iraq rejects all the flimsy excuses and pretexts stemming from this illegal decision that are used by these States in engaging in this hostile terrorist action in an attempt on their part to justify their military aggression against our country .  The logistic support made available by the governments of Saudi Arabia , Kuwait and Turkey to the United States and the United Kingdom , which includes the provision of air bases , has made them key partners in the terrorist aggression against Iraq , so that they bear international responsibility under international law .
