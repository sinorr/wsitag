In the past , we won great victories in revolution and construction by overcoming tremendous difficulties and dangers , because our party persistently educated party members , guided the masses , united people 's minds , and boosted people 's morale with the lofty ideal and with the objectives for the struggle in every historical stage .  
The ideal and belief education should be taken as a key point of in-depth education in Deng Xiaoping Theory . Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .  The people should be guided to integrate their personal values with socialist values and integrate the lofty ideal with the objectives of the struggle in the current stage , and dedicate themselves to the common ideal of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .

By using this image data and photogrammetry technology , not only is it possible to create traditional paper maps , it is also possible to build digital elevation models , produce digital orthographic projection maps and digital topographical maps , satisfying the need to support long-range weapons , cruise missiles , and other such precision guided weapons .  
Xu Qifeng ( professor ) : We know that satellites and guided missiles operate primarily under the effects of the earth 's gravitational force , and a precise calculation of their orbits or trajectories requires an accurate calculation of these gravitational forces .  Furthermore the calculation of earth 's gravitational force must be established on the basis of a coordinate system with a geocentric base point .  
Based on the rules governing guided missile movement , acquiring precise information of the gravitational distribution at each stage of the ballistic flight is an important research topic in gravimetric measurement , primarily involving the missile launch and strike precision , but also the coordinates of the launch point , the azimuth mark of the geodetic azimuth , the vertical deviation of the launch point , the gravity value , and other such geodetic survey work .

In its annual report released on 31 May the Defense Ministry of India once again spread the sheer fallacy of the so-called " theory of China threat " , alleging that there is an exceptionally great imbalance in nuclear power between China and India with China enjoying a huge superiority , that " all major cities in India are within the range of China 's guided missiles " and , fabricating rumors out of thin air , that China is assisting Pakistan in developing the latter 's missile and nuclear capability .  
Since the nuclear tests , India has stepped up the process to become nuclear armed in disregard of international community 's opposition .  Successively , it has established the " minimum nuclear deterrence " strategy , called for the establishment of a " three in one " nuclear strike system , frequently carried out various kinds of guided missile tests , and stepped up importing and developing advanced fighter planes .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
Under the leadership of the party 's leading collective of the second generation with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core , our party emancipated its mind and sought truth from facts ; shifted the work focus of both the party and the state towards the building of modernizations that centered around the country 's economic construction ; gradually gave form to a basic line that guided the country 's work at the initial stage of socialism upon its in-depth summarization of both positive and negative experiences gained from socialist construction ;  
The Gulf War and the Kosovo War have both borne out that since weapons have become more antipersonnel , only with superior operational capacity on the part of combat personnel , who are equipped with appropriate equipment and guided by a correct theory , will a combat unit secure more chances for winning a battle .  
Ground-to-air missiles , aviation missiles , ship-to-ship missiles , anti-tank missiles , conventional missiles , offensive tactical missiles , strategic nuclear missiles , and continental strategic missiles moved through Tiananmen Square , and almost all the new missile types from China 's guided missile family made their appearances .  
The psychological and electronic warfare troops established recently by the PLA coordinated for the first time the operations of military reconnaissance satellites over the Taiwan Strait . The second stage was " combined forces of the navy , the army and the air force crossing the Strait and carrying out landing operations , " which mostly consisted of guided missile attacks and other methods .  This illustrates the fact that the manner adopted by the PLA to attack Taiwan has switched from one of a " sea-borne landing " to " airborne raids " and other varieties .  
According to the uniform view expressed , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , grasped the overall situation , was based on an elevated perspective , and comprehensively reviewed and systematically summed up the party 's splendid history and basic experience of 80 years , thereby constituting a programmatic Marxist document rich in theoretical innovation , educating and encouraging the people , and urging the people forward .
