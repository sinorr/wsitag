The most recent annual report of UNCTAD stated that the average annual increase rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) of the least developed nations from 2000 to 2002 was 4.9 percent ; the average annual increase in the per capita GDP was 2.6 percent , exceeding the 1.8 percent level of average annual increase in the per capita GDP of other developing countries .  
Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .  Advanced countries and international organizations should provide the developing countries with a more practical and effective technical assistance to raise their ability to participate in the globalization process , thus allowing them to enjoy fairly the fruits of economic globalization from which common prosperity and development of the world can be realized .  
In the coming 5 years , the step of attracting investments should be accelerated ; industry structures , product structures and enterprise structures will be gradually adjusted .  " Three transformations " are to be realized : to immediately develop from single export processing to comprehensive functionality , to transform from a focus on traditional industries into focusing on developing of the new technology industry , and to transform from a focus on scattered , small-scale investment attraction into actively introducing large industry &amp; trade projects from foreign multinational companies and groups .  
In the past few years , scientific and technological achievements that have come out of researching , manufacturing and developing have mainly been new crystalline material , digital color TV with picture-in-picture function , UPS series products , bank POS systems , nationwide computer-controlled cement composite bag bagging machines , medium voltage switches , etc .  
The processing trade is developing comparatively quickly , with more than 200 state-owned enterprises in the whole region have joined the ranks of the processing trade , having equal shares with foreign funded enterprises in both number of enterprises and recorded contract value .  Moreover , their production and operation methods have gradually transformed from simple materials processing to fine , in-depth processing of high-tech and high added value commodities .  
At present , nearly 70 large projects , with 10-million US dollars being invested in each , have already spread out in a belt standing tall with more than 100 square kilometers along the 20 kilometer Gold Coast of Ningbo 's Beilun district , forming a recently emerging large industrial economic belt with leading industries such as petrochemical , iron and steel and developing subsidiary industries such as electric power , machinery , electronics , light industry and textile , building materials , plastic cement , etc .

The decreasing speed of eastern crude oil fields has slowed down clearly , whereas the increasing speed of western crude oil fields has been constantly accelerating .  The strategic pattern of " stabilizing the east and developing the west " has basically taken shape .  
At the same time , the Bank of China has also paid attention to bringing all advantages into full play , actively developing the work of marketing ; making the traditional business of international settlement continue to maintain an advantageous position in furious market competition ; and also gained the new development of intermediate services such as foreign exchange settlement and sales , credit cards , agents , substitute charges , etc .  
By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
In recent years , China has been paying close attention to development of the natural gas industry , and has drafted a development strategy for the land-based petroleum industry of " stabilizing the east , developing the west , and increasing oil and gas " .  
After three years of experimentation , issuance methods and features of transferable bonds are accepted domestically , henceforth loan bodies will make choices in areas such as transferable bonds , bonds and bank loans , etc . according to personal characteristics and market demand , optimizing financing structure ; systematically developing issuance of project financing bonds , ABS , etc . , with no recourse or limited recourse , thereby reducing the pressure of financial institutions in foreign lending , promoting project management to become international , to become scientic , and to become transparent .  
He said , current world economic globalization is developing deeply , investment flow is faster than trade flow , overseas investment and sales volumes of large western countries have greatly exceeded local import values , the proportion of foreign investments replacing direct imports is significantly increasing .  
The funds raised by " Shenye Holding Company " this time will primarily be invested in developing intercity bus service , national car rental network , and in the existing real estate projects , to build up an integrated enterprise with Hong Kong as a base and Shenzhen as a business focus .  
At the same time Yuan Chen emphasized that economic development among the developing countries is still not even .  The economy in many countries is still very fragile .  Their debts are still heavy and the poverty situation is worsening .  In the spirit of development and co-operation , the international community should adopt realistic and feasible measures to help these developing countries solve these problems .  
He pointed out that in the United Nations affairs , China has been consistently abiding by the goals and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter , seriously fulfilling its responsibilities , actively supporting various kinds of United Nations work done in the spirit of the Charter , and has made constructive efforts and positive contributions to maintaining world peace , seeking the just and reasonable resolution of major international and regional issues , protecting the interests of developing countries , and the promotion of equal co-operation and understanding among various countries .  
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Huaqiu Liu held talks with Kamyao here on the 29th .  Both parties exchanged opinions in depth regarding further developing bilateral relations and also international and regional problems that were of common concern , and they achieved widespread agreement .  
It marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and North and South , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order . 
For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
Actually , in view of the fact that the " TSEA " has directly undermined efforts exerted by both China and the United States since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1979 in improving and developing their bilateral relations , that it has violated the principled stand on " one China , " and that it has directly interfered in China 's internal affairs , it will definitely aggravate tension in the Taiwan Strait , intensify the regional arms race and further push Taiwan to war rather than protect Taiwan 's security .  
The practice of the half century since World War II has proven that the moves of GATT and the WTO in achieving big multilateral reductions in tariffs and nontariff measures , actively spurring the liberalization of international trade , enhancing the transparency of members ' trade policies , resolving trade disputes , and accepting large numbers of developing countries and regions to take part in the multilateral trade setup have played an extremely important role in expanding international trade and promoting world economic development .  
Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
In order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .  
During the UN Trade Development Council meeting , representatives of the international organizations and developing nations strongly called for reforming the current international rules and regulations , establishing a just and reasonable international political and economic order , and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor .  At the meeting , Michel Camdessus , managing director of the IMF , urged the rich countries to embrace the poor ones and jointly built a new era of cooperation .  
The Bangkok Declaration emphasized the necessity of establishing a fair and regular " multilateral trade system " and operating in a nondiscriminating and transparent way , which would be conducive to all the countries , the developing ones in particular .  
and carry out internal restructuring of overall agriculture , by " returning farmland to forest " in mountain areas , " returning farmland to grassland " in pastoral areas , and " returning farmland to fishery " in lake areas ; that is , we should abandon the method of developing agriculture and grain production at the cost of sacrificing the ecological environment , and open up a broad space for increasing new products that suit the demand of the international market and have competitive advantage .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
We need to focus on the key strategic plans for national economic development , mobilizing the advantage of overseas Chinese resources to the service of the strategies of revitalizing China through science and education and sharply developing western China .  
Since the founding of new China , the party and government have attached great importance to developing the people 's education and devoted great efforts to it ; there have been tremendous developments in China 's education and large numbers of outstanding talented people have been trained for socialist construction .  
Dai Xianglong said : Implementing the strategy of developing the western regions is an important plan for restructuring the economy and promoting the coordinated development of regional economies .  It is an important measure for increasing domestic demand and promoting the sustained , rapid and coordinated development of the national economy .  It is also an important opportunity for the restructuring of bank credits and promoting the development of banking .  
By cooperating with and serving others , Chongqing should solve well the problem of redundant industrial structure that is likely to occur during the course of developing the Western Region . By serving others , it should strengthen itself , attain the goal of " striving to turn Chongqing into an economic center on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang put forward by General Secretary Jiang Zemin , and join the western provinces and autonomous regions in building a great economic circle of sustainable development in the Western Region .  
Forces will be concentrated on key basic research projects and key projects , such as digital high division television , broadband high-speed information network , industrial automation , civil airplanes , and civil satellites and on developing newly rising industries . 
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
Meanwhile , they are also conducive to enhancing understanding , expanding common understanding , turning the party and government policies and principles into the majority of people 's conscious action , discovering and pooling the wisdom and experience of the masses , relying on the people to tide over difficulties and resolve problems , harmonizing the relationship in distribution of interests , eliminating social contradictions , and safeguarding and developing the political situation featured by unity and stability .  
Hu Jintao emphasized that the key to seizing and using well the opportunity of the great development of the west to speed up economic and social development lies in doing a good job in building the party organizations at all levels ; in particular , the leading cadres at all levels must play a model role , firmly advance in the forefront of emancipating and developing the productive forces and promoting the building of the two civilizations , and unite and lead the masses to work hard together .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
To represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .  They represent the essential demands of socialism , and the line running through them represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  We must earnestly comprehend Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech concerning the �t hree represents .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
In line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " Beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .  We should resolutely implement the spirit of the official , written reply of the State Council ;  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
In his report Li Peng also discussed the main tasks for this year and next in better relying on the people 's deputies to do a good job in Standing Committee work , unfolding thorough and protracted education in socialist democracy and legal system , further developing a new situation in exchanges and cooperation with foreign and international parliaments and assemblies , and continuing to step up the building of the Standing Committee itself .  
A responsible official of Chongqing Municipality indicated today that this municipality will seize the historical opportunity of extensively developing western regions to build itself into an economic center on the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and will , at the same time , adopt effective measures to ensure the smooth fulfillment of the task on relocating the residents at the Three Gorges reservoir areas .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
A new round of structural adjustment is being carried out throughout the world ; new - and high-technology industry and newly emerging industry are developing robust ; intellectual economy has raged like a storm , and world economic competition has become increasingly intense .  
Since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world was launched , our party has asserted , in accordance with the theory on China being on the initial stage of socialism , that liberating and developing the productive forces is the essential demand and fundamental task of socialism and proceeded to formulate its own basic line , basic program , and a set of principles and policies , with the stress on unwavering adherence to the party 's basic line , focusing on unwavering adherence to economic construction being the center of all endeavors .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
Zeng Peiyan suggested : We should devote major efforts to advancing education for improving the overall quality of students ; accelerating the fostering of qualified personnel ; deepening structural reform in the fields of science , technology , and education ; strengthening technological innovation ; developing high technology ; achieving industrialization ; accelerating the establishment of a state innovation system ; nurturing enterprises into a genuine mainstay in technological innovation ; and making science , technology , and education serve economic construction even better .  
The surging tide of acquisitions and mergers among international enterprises is breeding yet another major industrial transfer .  After accepting the market for labor-intensive industries in the 1970s , developing countries may have to brace themselves again for the full-fledged onslaught of multinational companies .  
Now that Guangdong has built up considerable economic strength , how should it grasp the new opportunity and improve its overall economic quality through positive involvement in full-fledged competition in the international market on the basis of consolidating and developing the existing economy is a new task .  
In other words , they attempt to bring developing countries to their strategic track and force developing countries to facilitate their hegemonist goal and to be their dependencies .  However , most developing countries have the bitter experience of being bullied and humiliated by Western big powers , thus they extremely treasure their national sovereignty and dignity and , of course , resolutely oppose and struggle against the so-called " human rights standard " and the " values " foisted on them by the current hegemonist powers .  
The telegram says : In the past 45 years , under the leadership of the Lao People 's Revolutionary Party , the people of all nationalities in Laos won a victory in national and democratic revolution , established the Lao People 's Democratic Republic , and continuously made new achievements in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty and developing national undertakings .  In particular , since the initiation of the innovation and opening up drive , Laos has made ceaseless progress in all undertakings and made noticeable achievements in continuously improving the people 's living standards .  
Zhu Rongji said : Mr President is the Chinese people 's old friend .  We satisfactorily see that in the last 36 years since China and the Republic of Congo forged diplomatic ties , our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have been steadily and smoothly developing .  Sound cooperation full of positive results has been carried out in the political , economic and trade , public health , and educational fields .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .  It is hoped that both sides will continue to make efforts and do effective work , thus continuously advancing bilateral friendship and cooperation and achieving more concrete cooperation results to bring benefits to both peoples .  
Recently , the DPRK has actively carried out diplomatic activities ; worked hard to improve and strengthen its relations with the neighboring countries ; readjusted its diplomatic strategies towards the United States and Japan in a timely fashion ; expanded its exchanges with the developing countries ; and further normalized its relations with the western countries with excellent results .  
[ Li Dingfan ] Our country 's nuclear industry was established in 1955 .  In the past 40 years or so , the industry developed tremendously from scratch and succeeded in developing " two bombs and one boat , " thus enabling China to become one of the nuclear countries in the world , smashing the nuclear monopoly and blackmail by the imperialists and hegemonists , greatly boosting its comprehensive national strength , and making tremendous contributions in maintaining world peace .  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
The publication and implementation of " the Provisions " indicate that China has advanced a big step in developing legal system governing public security and border patrol .  They have very important significance in demonstrating China 's efforts to strengthen the administration over vessels along the coasts , to prevent and crack down on marine crimes , and to safeguard social order along coastal regions and at sea .  
However , we are principled on developing Sino-US relations ; that is , we should strictly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations , especially the principle of mutual respect of each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
The central government has put an end to its past practice of uniform and direct central management and control by allowing various localities and departments to adopt flexible or varied production or operation modes ; has called for developing a superior economy by suiting measures to the local conditions or opportunities ; has urged all sectors to carry out economic accounting and ensure economic efficiency ;  
Finally , the " Opinion " calls on local people 's governments at all levels and the departments concerned to make overall plans for developing social welfare undertakings , set reasonable work targets , and avoid such practices as acting arbitrarily , rushing headlong into mass action , making overlapping efforts , and wasting resources .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
To make static targets moveable , the task force engaged in tackling major technical hurdles worked without a letup for several months , made do with whatever was available , and thus succeeded in developing movable false tanks , false armored cars , and other false targets .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
It is necessary to further clearly define the major objectives , basic tasks and major principles and policies for developing the minority nationalities areas , and promote population , resources , environmental , as well as economic and social development in a coordinated and stage-by-stage manner and with an objective in mind . "  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
We have attached great importance to developing good neighborly and friendly relations , as well as relations of all-round cooperation , with Vietnam ; and are willing to make common efforts with Vietnam 's new leading collective in opening up a brighter future prospect for the relations between our two parties and two countries .  
Those who truly base themselves on reality and on the long future have set their vision on some feasible aspects .  While improving their own techniques and management , they have established the systems of authentication , distribution , and security , in addition to developing in the direction of professionalization .  They have aimed at the identified market targets and actively opened up market space , and made a link between enterprises and enterprises and between enterprises and consumers with networks .  
Our stand of opposing " Taiwan independence " has won the support of all the Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots , and met with general approval in the international community .  It has also hit the sore point of " Taiwan independence " elements .  Therefore , some diehard " Taiwan independence " elements are not willing to see the cross-strait relations developing in the direction of the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation because of their natural instinct of " Taiwan independence . "  
He noted that for decades , this movement has adhered to the aims and principles of independence , autonomy , non-alignment , and non-grouping , always devoting its efforts to defending the interests of the many developing countries , and actively promoting the establishment of a new just and rational international political and economic order , in an outstanding effort to promote peace and development for the human race .  
During President Jiang Zemin 's trip to Japan in 1998 , he jointly formulated with Japanese leaders the fundamental policy on developing Japanese-Chinese ties gearing toward the future .  It indicated that Japanese-Chinese ties entered a new phase , and that both countries have established bilateral ties which were varied and mutually interdependent .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
Our experience for more than 20 years has proved that these measures and actions in afforestation and improving the environment conform to the reality that our country faces arduous tasks in environmental construction and lacks funds .  Through these measures and actions , the socialist system 's advantages are given full play , and at the same time , people from around the whole country have a heightened awareness of the need for afforestation .  These measures and actions are a lively implementation of patriotism and are worthy of our careful summing up and further perfecting and developing .  
He pointed out that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Cuba . The two countries ' relations have developed smoothly in recent years .  Particularly since the realization of the mutual visit between President Jiang Zemin and President Castro , the cooperation level between the two sides has risen ; cooperation areas have constantly expanded ; and the Sino-Cuban relationship has entered a period of comprehensive development .  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and Cuba .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
The building of party character and honest government has been a clear success , and we have formulated a complete set of guiding ideologies , basic principles , leadership system , and work pattern to fight corruption .  We have introduced a series of laws and regulations on honest government , and we have to different degrees solved some of the more serious problems the masses are most concerned about .  The struggle to treat the symptoms and the causes of corruption is developing in depth and is gaining breadth .  
Our Chinese ancestors settled on the Taiwan Island a long time ago .  They contributed a lot of hard work developing the land , and carried out unremitting and moving struggles defending this land against foreign aggressors .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
It should be pointed out that the noticeable difference between the developing countries and developed countries is that due to being exploited and controlled by colonialism and imperialism for a long time in the past and now being at a low level of economic development , the vast number of developing countries are bound to place their state sovereignty , survival rights , and development rights at priority positions .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
We are happy to see that Turkey 's people , with their own capable hands , obtained an outstanding accomplishment while in the midst of the process of building their own country .  The society is unceasingly progressing , the economy is rapidly developing , the living standard of the people is increasing day by day , and Turkey has already become a spectacular country in the international community .  
Empirical evidence shows that the peoples of ancient nations , as long as they positively bring into play the profound advantages accumulated from their culture and diligent , brave traditions , can also absorb modern scientific culture 's inventions and creations , keenly innovate , and unceasingly strengthen themselves , and thereby definitely have the capability , while on the road to developing themselves , of writing a new chapter that accords with the demands of the age .  
The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing long-term , stable friendly relations and cooperation with Greece and is ready to work together with the Greek side in further expanding and deepening cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields to constantly score new , great successes .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational , and new international political and economic order .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational and new international political and economic order .  
However , from a host of startling incidents that have been exposed , we have seen cases of many Falungong followers concealing their ailments , refusing to consult doctors , missing the chance of treatment , and ending up dead or disabled ; we have also seen cases of many Falungong practitioners believing in Li Hongzhi 's heretical arguments and fallacies , developing mental disorder , causing bodily harm to themselves or committing suicide , or even killing others , thus destroying family peace and social stability .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
As far as social supervision is concerned , what is most crucial is that supervision departments should earnestly change their guiding ideology for developing the capital market , really proceed from giving play to market functions and improving the efficiency of the distribution of capital resources , strengthen supervision over the " openness , justice and fairness " of market , reduce unnecessary interference , adopt measures to gradually release and curb market " bubbles , " and reduce the overall risk of market .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .  But this figure is still below the level of the world 's maritime economy , which accounts for 7 percent of the world 's total economic aggregates .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
[ Liu Shijin ] After we started the reform and opening-up drive , we reexamined and adjusted our previous strategy of giving priority to developing the heavy industry .  This resulted in the pattern of industrial development with emphasis on the textile and other light industries during the early and middle periods of the 80 ' s of the 20th century .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
While vigorously developing agriculture , the DPRK party and government have actively developed the agricultural sideline production and encouraged the people to plant mulberries to raise silkworms and to raise fish and pigs with a view to improving the people 's consumption .  In the meantime , the party and government have launched a nationwide lecture on popular science knowledge to disseminate the knowledge of growing cash crops and breeding animals with economic value .  
On the world political arena , China , as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and the largest developing country , has a weighty international status and a positive , major impact on peace and development for mankind , which have won high international dignity and honor for itself .  
This is not only beneficial to stimulating trade and international resources , but is also helpful in alleviating the contradiction of domestic oversupply .  It is beneficial toward developing an economy of scale and will help to effectively attract advanced foreign technology and management experience .  Moreover , direct overseas investment will be beneficial in terms of employee training and introduction .  
China has always devoted its efforts to international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy , advocating efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons .  But we should not ignore the legitimate right of all countries , particularly developing countries , to use nuclear energy peacefully , even less so applying a double standard , to exploit anti-proliferation as the means for restricting and obstructing cooperation by all countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
Foreign army materials show that the Russian Army recently formulated a basic concept for developing a command system at the current stage .  An important aspect was cutting back and readjusting fixed command facilities and building a field campaign command center equipped with various functions and capable of rapid response .  
At that time our country 's capacity for screening chemical compounds was less than one-tenth of that of a single US research institute .  Despite the circumstances , members of the project group were determined to carry out innovative research .  Eventually they triumphed over their powerful adversaries , smashed the preoccupation that " developing countries are unable to develop new drugs " and captured the world 's commanding height of developing the anti-malaria drug .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
However , in order to bring about a rapid economic growth of the national economy , the developing countries have generally selected the developed areas to implement a special opening up policy to promote further economic development of the developed areas by means of preferential policies and have regarded these areas as growth centers for promoting the overall development of the national economy .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
The $ 60-billion limited " Star War " missile defense , in US official language , is to counter the threat from so-called " rogue states " ( recently the United States has changed their names to " concerned countries " ) because those countries possess or are developing guided missile system and are threatening or will threaten the security of the United States and its allies within five years .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
Since large enterprises are not required to exercise the function of bearing the financial burden in supporting social undertakings , the surplus personnel they released have to be digested by small and medium-sized enterprises .  Many new service sectors , such as service units in cities and towns as well as community services , have also relied on the support of small and medium-sized enterprises .  As a developing and rising group , small and medium-sized enterprises have started to show their vitality .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
These principles have now become universal standards for country-to-country relations , playing a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the friendship and cooperation among developing countries in general , and they are and will continue to have an important impact on the promotion of the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .  In particular , they should increase their investments in education and science and technology , vigorously developing and training talented individuals , emphasizing the development of new and advanced technology industries , accelerating industrial upgrades , promoting the sustained and rapid development of the Asian economy in the new century and gradually enabling the people everywhere to affluent lives .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
All levels should regard improving leadership styles and doing well the positive three Stresses education as the concrete embodiment of carrying out the requirements of the " Three Representations " , as a real action of focusing on grassroots units and laying solid foundations , and as an important indicator of reinforcing and developing the achievements of the " Three Stresses " education held for Party committees at levels higher than the regiment .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
Among all sorts of comments , however , there is an overwhelming keynote : A crucial standard for judging the success or failure of the G-8 summit is what it has done for the developing regions , especially the poorest regions .  As the gap between poor and rich countries is widening and deepening , the G-8 is facing a grim challenge of the " digital gap " .  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
By saying that we should dare to say something new not mentioned by the old ancestors , he meant that as the times are moving ahead and practice is developing , new conditions and new issues will emerge in an endless stream , and it is impossible to find ready-made answers and solutions for our current issues from the works of the old ancestors .  We must work out solutions by ourselves by integrating the universal principles of Marxism with our current conditions and practice through studying new conditions , answering new questions , and blazing new trails .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
Second , major contradictions that can disrupt international security tend to become more strained .  For example , the contradiction between uni-polarization and multi-polarization , the contradiction between advanced countries and developing countries , and the contradictions between different nationalities and religions have all aggravated to different extents under the negative influence of economic globalization and as a result of the new interventionism practiced by the United States .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
Meanwhile , the current international situation remains relatively complicated .  While peace and development are the main themes at present , hegemonism and power politics still exist .  The unfair and unreasonable international economic order is still playing its role , and the wealth gap between developing and developed countries keeps widening .  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
From the start , JBIV has been rather attentive to drawing other news media 's development experience and paid attention to developing an internet medium by making use of its own traditional superiority under the conditions of insufficient personnel and funds and relatively weak technical support .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
In diplomatic work , Comrade Geng Biao was firm on matters of principle and flexible on matters of tactics .  He put forward his unique viewpoints and creative ideas in light of the developing and changing situation .  He displayed very strong grasp of policy and strong mastery of the art of struggle .  
This afternoon , ministers from some 40 African countries in charge of diplomacy and economic and trade affairs gathered together with their Chinese counterparts in the Grand Banquet Hall of Beijing Hotel for the China-Africa Cooperation Forum - - Ministerial Conference 2000 .  They held a candid exchange of opinions and discussions on the two major themes of this conference : promoting the building of a new international political and economic order through China-Africa cooperation and further developing China-Africa economic and trade cooperation .  
This is not only an inevitable choice that developing countries must make in order to seek development in the new century , but also a driving force for building at an early date a new international political and economic order that is just and reasonable .  
This humorous remark elicited warm applause of all participants in the forum , which expressed the strong aspiration of developing countries toward building a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
They said that China had for a long time provided unconditional economic assistance to the African continent , and even though China is not Africa 's major creditor , this action taken by China as a developing country is indicative of its sincere hope to join Africa in realizing the common development aspiration within the framework of South-South cooperation .  Plus , this will help prompt Western countries to take real action toward the relief and reduction of Africa 's debts , they added .  
During the 10-year calamity , our country suffered from leftist disruptions and deviated from the fundamental task of " developing social productive forces " ; as a result , the national economy almost came to the brink of collapse and the Chinese nation lost a valuable development opportunity .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
Li Zibin answered : The party Central Committee and the State Council have received a positive response from the people in the western region since they proposed implementing the strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  The vast masses of cadres and people in the western region are determined to seize this opportunity to bring about a leap in economic and social development .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
It is notable that while continuing to deepen bilateral military alliances with Japan , Australia , and the ROK , the United States is restoring and developing military ties with countries such as Thailand , the Philippines , Vietnam , and Singapore through a variety of military cooperation forms , such as gaining the right to use military facilities , agreements on military unit visits , joint military exercises , and so on , thereby markedly expanding its military presence in non-alliance countries and further increasing its military capability for intervening in Asia-Pacific affairs .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
Having witnessed improved economic life , people have started recognizing or supporting the SAR Government 's measures aimed at developing the economy , including measures for severely cracking down on illegal economic activities , for protecting intellectual property rights , for rectifying the market order , for building a much better international image for Macao , for raising the government work efficiency , for improving an internal investment environment , for inviting more outside investment or capital , and so on .  
It consisted of more than 5,000 people , making it the largest such delegation ever .  President Jiang Zemin met with the delegation and delivered a major speech on consolidating and developing Sino-Japanese friendship , which elicited positive responses among the people of both countries .  In October Premier Zhu Rongji paid an official visit to Japan and , in the spirit of enhancing trust , clearing suspicion , and expanding cooperation , engaged in wide contact with the Japanese government and all sectors of society .  
He discussed China 's principled stand on creating a new international political and economic order .  Like water pouring down a steep roof , his words powerfully reflected the heartfelt wishes of the peoples of all nations , particularly the numerous developing nations , for peace and development and were widely praised by the delegations .  
The draft has dedicated an entire chapter to the issue of national defense education for society , and formed stipulations respectively on the formats and demands for developing national defense education by state organs , enterprise units , social groups , committees for city residents , and committees for residents in rural areas ; and the formats and demands of conducting national defense education on militia and people on reserve duty by relevant military organs .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .  
Second , it is positively implementing strategic adjustment of the economic structure , and it is doing all we can to achieve comprehensive advancement of tertiary industries in the direction of speeding up the development of modern service industries , powerfully developing high-tech industries , and positively moving modernization of agriculture forward .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
During his visit Chairman Li Peng specially arranged to see the relatives of Dr . Kotnis , who sacrificed his precious life for the cause of the Chinese people 's liberation , and held extensive contacts and chats with responsible persons of Indian friendship bodies and figures in business , science and technology , and cultural circles , in which he conveyed to the Indian people the friendly feelings of the Chinese people and their sincere aspirations for developing bilateral ties .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
However , some local criminal and vicious groups are rapidly developing and their activities are becoming more and more vicious in recent years .  They have been using extremely cruel measures , which seriously undermine public security in society .  They have gradually become destructive and harmful criminal groups of Mafia nature .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
Vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is very important for us to live through the rigid test of reform , opening up and developing the socialist market economy and continuously advancing the current great project .  
The " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " was extended for an indefinite period with the support of many developing countries in 1995 , and the " Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty " was adopted by the United Nations in 1996 .  This is because the international community confirmed that the world would ultimately move toward a " nuclear-free " prospect and believed that the major nuclear arms powers would , in the end , gradually achieve balanced arms disarmament on the basis of cooperation among major powers .  
It has thoroughly given up the practice of either leaning toward the West or confronting the West , but has adopted an omnidirectional foreign strategy of conducting dialogue , laying equal stress on relations with the East and the West , developing relations with big powers , and strengthening bilateral or multilateral relations with other countries , aimed at protecting its national interests , particularly economic interests .  
Moreover , because its previous East European allies are now leaning toward the West , the pro-Western and separatist elements in the Commonwealth of Independent States are increasing , and Russia 's national strength is weakening , it can not afford much fund to help developing countries ; therefore its role in international affairs will be restricted .  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
These leaders should pay attention to study characteristics of these units , meticulously review positive experiences drawn from practice , and enthusiastically explore new issues and new problems that arise in the condition of reforming , opening up and developing a socialist market economy .  These leaders should closely associate the essence of the five-sentence general requirement and the " Program " with the reality of these " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units , work in a creative manner and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of our work .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
Persisting in focusing on economic construction and greatly liberating and developing the social productive forces are the largest political missions for China at the present time and reflect the basic interests of the people across the country , including the vast majority of members of the united front .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in the meeting of the national united front work that , only by persisting in developing the most extensive patriotic united front led by our Party and uniting the entire Chinese people to make joint striving to materialize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people , can we be certain of success .  
In recent years , as China has developed into a stronger China with continually enhanced international status , which the United States does not like to see , while strategically maintaining ties and economically occupying the China market , the United States has stubbornly played the human rights card , sowed discord between the masses and the government , and frequently caused trouble , interfering in , blocking , and sabotaging the cause of the Chinese people in following the road they have chosen and continually developing and growing stronger .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
As China is a developing country as well as a major country which brooks no neglect in the political and economic life in the world .  Because China conducts a lot of international trade , when the trade talks involve concrete conflicting interests among the parties , everybody wants to hold the negotiations in a more explicit and detailed manner .  
Since its establishment , the foundation has given full play to its own characteristics and advantages , and has , with the assistance of friendly organizations and enthusiastic people at home and abroad , dedicated itself to developing the cultural , educational , science , technology and welfare undertakings for children and promoting the healthy mental and physical development of children ;  
Jiang Zemin also extended congratulations to the newly formed Thai Government and expressed his appreciation of the Thai Government 's active attitude toward developing friendly relations with China . He said : China supports Thailand 's stand to promote friendly cooperation with its neighbors and to facilitate regional dialogue and cooperation .  Jiang Zemin said he believes that Thailand will play a positive role for regional peace , stability and development .

However , due to the irrational international economic order formed long time ago , various countries do not have an equal share of the benefits of globalization , developing countries are in a relatively unfavorable position in the process of globalization , and the wealth gap between the North and the South has been widened further .  
In order to provide market access opportunities for the undertaking of developing institutional investors on an usual scale and on the basis of strict self-discipline , the China Securities Regulatory Commission will adopt a series of measures including introduction of open-end fund , making preparations for and give approval to establishment of new fund companies , paying attention to relevant preparation work in terms of establishment of fund management companies of Chinese-foreign joint ventures , and conducting studies on proposals of innovation of various funding products which have been transformed from closed-end to open-end .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .

Wang Shijie stressed : In the new century , various countries should promote democratization of international relations and establish a new international political and economic order that is fair and just .  They should ensure that the broad masses of developing countries have the right to equally participate in the decisions on global economic affairs .  
However , owing to the irrational international economic order that has been formed for a long time , the benefits received by various countries in globalization are very unbalanced , the developing countries are in a relatively disadvantageous position in the process of globalization , and the gap between the poor and the rich and between the South and the North has been further widened .  
He said that under the current international situation of multipolarization and economic globalization , the developing countries should intensify unity and coordination , cope with all problems in a positive attitude , and make concerted efforts to establish a fair , reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : Countries in East Asia and Latin American are mostly developing countries .  They have common interests and tasks .  They are all exploring a path of development commensurate with their own national conditions and seeking a regional cooperation model in conformity with their own actual conditions , and striving to usher in a more stable , equal , and fair world .  We have a common wish to use each other 's experience as reference , learn from each other , and cooperate with each other .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
Brazilian Ambassador Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto said that Brazil and China are two important developing countries , adding that the two countries have had good ties of political cooperation and take an identical or similar stand on major international affairs .  He said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries would further cement bilateral relations and deepen mutual understanding and consensus between the two peoples .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
Personalities here believe that the benign interaction of the Chinese and Australian senior military officers will be beneficial to developing a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries and armies and to maintaining regional security as well .  
Developed countries , and even some developing countries , have invariably realized that a trial of strength in a future hi-tech war will first and foremost be a trial of strength over science and technology , and a comprehensive trial of strength over science and technology is , in the final analysis , competition over qualified personnel .  In a certain sense , it could be said that the outcome of today 's competition over qualified personnel will decide the outcome of tomorrow 's fighting on a battlefield .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .

Everybody who has little , elementary knowledge of the international law knows that the exclusive economic zone is the major outcome of the long-term struggle waged by numerous developing countries for their legal rights and interests after World War II .  
Although a number of developing countries or countries making an economic switch are practicing a market economy legal system , the market is unable to operate efficiently because the law and rule of law is not on a sound basis ; on the one hand lack of clarity in individual and enterprise property rights means that economic efficiency falls , contracts can not be effectively enforced , and disputes can not be settled in fair fashion ;  
To keep alive its advanced nature , our party should concentrate on developing the social productive forces , closely follow the major trend of development in the world in terms of science and technology and economy , take economic construction as the center , combine the advanced trends in the knowledge economy , science and technology progress , and social development in an organic way , and strive to serve well as the representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces .

Intensifying coordination and cooperation and deepening the strategic partnership between China and Brazil is of vital significance to augmenting the strength of the developing countries as a whole and giving impetus to the establishment of a fair , rational new political and economic order in the world .  
Jiang Zemin expressed his firm belief that constant strengthening of Sino-Brazil relations not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and their people , but also conforms to the common interests of the large numbers of developing countries , and definitely will make positive contributions to lasting regional and world peace and prosperity .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
Li Baodong pointed out : According to this strategy , the Chinese Government will appropriate huge amounts of funds for developing infrastructure facilities and basic industries in these areas , thus keeping the economic growth rate in these areas higher than the national average .  Last year , the economic growth rate in the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups reached 8.5 percent .  
At the ceremony marking the publication of the first report from the forum " China and Her Neighbors , " a joint effort of the Wilton Park Conference , an independent British academic organization , and the Hong Kong Superior Resources Group , Wang Zhile pointed out that , faced with economic globalization , the developed nations and the developing nations alike should readjust the angles and ways in which they view the issue .

The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
China attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Yugoslavia in the political , economic , cultural and educational areas .  China maintains that healthy development of Sino-Yugoslav relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Besides , it is also right and proper for " those who owe more to repay more ; " moreover , under the Kyoto Protocol , developing countries also accept the responsibility for curbing climatic change according to the principle of " collective but differentiated responsibility . "  The United States must not stare fixedly at the chimneys in other countries while turning a blind eye to the smoke surging from the far more numerous chimneys at home .  
Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .

It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .

Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .

He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
The Pakistani people are so full of wisdom .  His humorous words laid bare the fact that the United States keeps using its " 301 Article " against developing countries and tries to link the human rights issue to China 's permanent normal trade position .  Even the US representative could not help but force a wry and embarrassed smile .  
On 29 April , Li Ruogu , assistant president of the People 's Bank of China and deputy Chinese director of the IMF , called on developed countries to make greater effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , maintain the stability of exchange rates between major currencies , and thus create a better external environment for economic growth in developing countries .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .

Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .

The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .

Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .

we must adhere to the guiding principle of " one central task , two important jobs , and three assurances , " i.e . , we should regard economic construction as the central task , closely attend to maintaining stability and developing the economy , and ensure long-term social peace and stability in Tibet , ensure the rapid development of Tibet 's economy , and ensure notable improvement of the living standard of the people of Tibet ;  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .

We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .

Asia is the world 's most populous region where most developing countries are situated , which have numerous newly rising markets , various natural resources , and investment effect with unlimited potential .  
Third , as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the biggest developing country in the world , China has persistently pursued an independent and good-neighborly foreign policy , advocated engaging all-directional dialogues with all regions of the world , including Europe , and promoted the establishment of a fairer and more rational international political and economic new order .  
Here I would like to make a special explanation of one thing , that is , the " multipolarization , " which the Chinese people have often referred to , is based on a new understanding of the international relations in the new period or based on the philosophic and cultural theory that " the world is pluralistic and diversified in nature " rather than developing confrontation against a certain superpower or letting just a few big powers decide world affairs .  
At this critical moment for carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future , the party Central Committee and the State Council are holding a relevant meeting to summarize past experience and arrange the work for the next 10 years .  The current meeting will certainly have a profound impact on the work of aiding and developing poor areas for the new period .  
The great achievements made by China in supporting and developing poor areas have made important contributions to promoting economic growth , national unity , frontier security , and social stability , and to helping people to live a comfortable life on the whole . 
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
We must always uphold the guidelines for work in Tibet during the new period formulated at the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , which call for " taking economic construction as the central task ; firmly focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation ; and ensuring Tibet 's accelerated economic development , all-round social progress , lasting peace and stability , and continuous improvement of the people 's living standards .

We must never be unworthy of the concern and expectation of the central authorities and the whole nation .  We must overcome all difficulties , work vigorously to make the region prosperous , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , and produce brilliant results once more in the course of developing Tibet by leaps and bounds and ensuring lasting peace and stability .

When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .

This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
In a meeting today with Rupert C . Montanaro , commander of the armed forces of Malta , Chi Haotian , vice chairman of the Central Military Commission , state councilor , and national defense minister , said that developing healthy and lasting military ties between the two countries under the new historic conditions is the common wish of the Chinese and Maltese people .

In addition , some stress cooperation among the cities in the course of economic globalization in an attempt to " get rid of constraints imposed by states " .  Such a view is as a matter of fact an attempt to break down the existing legal system in various countries , which runs counter to the interests of developing countries and is not conducive to improving habitat conditions in those countries .  
Over the past century and half , it has kept advancing continually in practice , developing continually in practice , studying new situations , answering new questions , and continually incorporating , borrowing , and integrating various outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , thereby enabling Marxism to always maintain its vitality and to continually open new realms .

As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
The meeting was of the view that the WTO ministerial meeting to be held in November in Doha , Qatar , will be an important opportunity to start a new round of trade talks ; and that it is necessary to speed up WTO work , decide as quickly as possible on an agenda of talks that is balanced , maneuverable , and broadly based , and to show special concern for the interests of developing members .  
The ministers firmly committed themselves to pursue open regionalism , reaffirming APEC 's strong support for an open , equitable , sound , and rule-based multilateral trading system , from which all economies , developed and developing ones alike , stand to benefit .  
The ministers reaffirmed the statement of the Brunei Ministerial Conference and Informal Leadership Meeting on launching a new round of multilateral trade talks in 2001 , held that the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in November in Qatar represents a critical opportunity for the launch of a new round of WTO talks and that it is necessary to accelerate WTO work , speedily formulate a balanced , operational , broad-based agenda for the talks , and expressed particular concern for the interests of developing members .  
Berger was Clinton 's military advisor on foreign affairs and security questions , and was a motivating force for the United States and China developing " relations of strategic partners " .  At present , he still insists that " based on the United States ' principles of democracy and national security , the government is obligated to continue to carry out policies to maintain contact with China in principle " .  
Whether to let more countries , including developing nations , share the opportunities and benefits brought on by economic globalization , or to continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries is a choice that must be made in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations held by the WTO .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
For this purpose , President Jiang put forward four proposals , namely , " replenishing and developing the ' Shanghai Five ' mechanism " , " deepening cooperation in the security field , " " advancing bilateral and multilateral economic and trade cooperation " , and " strengthening cooperation on the international stage " .  
The military region party committee , maintaining that these personnel should contribute their talents and services to developing ways and means for winning future warfare , decided to turn them into highly proficient military personnel during the course when the armed forces were engaged in science and technology training .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
In its annual report released on 31 May the Defense Ministry of India once again spread the sheer fallacy of the so-called " theory of China threat " , alleging that there is an exceptionally great imbalance in nuclear power between China and India with China enjoying a huge superiority , that " all major cities in India are within the range of China 's guided missiles " and , fabricating rumors out of thin air , that China is assisting Pakistan in developing the latter 's missile and nuclear capability .  
Since the nuclear tests , India has stepped up the process to become nuclear armed in disregard of international community 's opposition .  Successively , it has established the " minimum nuclear deterrence " strategy , called for the establishment of a " three in one " nuclear strike system , frequently carried out various kinds of guided missile tests , and stepped up importing and developing advanced fighter planes .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
On the sound basis of political mutual trust , China attaches importance to developing economic cooperation with neighboring countries and has actively uplifted economic cooperation to a higher level .  
It speaks for equal treatment , seeking common ground while reserving differences , instead of using force or threatening to use force , or seeking dominance or even acting like a bully .  It strives to achieve cooperative security by developing extensive exchanges and cooperation .  In this way , it will benefit peace and development of the world .  
After the Bush administration came to power , it treated Russia as " the number one potential opponent " of the United States . It showed an extreme distrust of the Putin government and expressed strong disapproval of Russia 's developing military cooperation with Iran in addition to restoring and strengthening its relationships with some former Soviet Union allies .  
It is learned that because of the wide gap in the ratio of investment in offensive and defensive weapons , the national army is actively developing " defensive deterrence weapons system , " including secret development of the medium-range ballistic missile with a firing range from 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers , code-named " Tiching . " The army has reported the whole program to President Chen Shui-bian , who has asked the military to develop it as a priority key project .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
In discussing the bilateral military relationship , Chi Haotian said the Chinese armed forces are very positive regarding developing friendly relations with the British armed forces , with the frequent high-level exchanges of visits between the two countries ' armed forces in recent years , and constant progress in each area of cooperation and exchange .  
Use Marxist materialist conception of history to gradually weaken idealist theism , replace feudalism and superstition and ignorance and backwardness with modern knowledge in science and technology , divert the attention of religion believers toward developing the economy and improving living standard materially and culturally , and guide religion into categories compatible with the socialist society for the temples , monks and nuns to play a positive and useful role in social life .  
At the moment of commemorating the 80th anniversary of the party 's founding , we should seriously sum up the historical achievements of the united front and more profoundly understand its development regularity and historic mission .  This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .  
During those warring years , the reason for the strength of the party growing from small to big , the propositions of the party conforming with the popular feelings , and the armed forces of the party developing like a single spark starting a prairie fire was because the party regarded doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses in doing everything as its fundamental line .  As it could fulfill what it said and represented the fundamental interests of the people , it won the hearts of the people .  
The quality level in science has a great impact on the way people use knowledge to conduct scientific thinking and the way of improving science and technological innovation .  The level in science also greatly impacts developing productive forces and culture .  
I hope the masses of science and technology workers will stay on the cutting edge of the new era , closely integrating personal ambitions with the nation 's future and fate ; undertake the historical responsibility of promoting science and technology advancements and innovations ; and continuously contribute to developing China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized modern socialist country .  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
It also adopted the guiding principle and policy of " letting literature and art service socialism and the people " and " letting a-hundred flowers blossom and a-hundred schools of thought contend . "  Furthermore , it emphasized the necessity of developing a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  All this has shown that the CPC has always represented the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and that it has been making unremitting efforts to bring about and develop our prosperous and outstanding national culture .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
China started the use of foreign capital from scratch and saw an ever-growing increase in this aspect .  As of the end of 2000 , our country approved establishing more than 364,000 foreign-funded enterprises , contracts involving US $ 676.7-billion were signed , and US $ 348.6-billion foreign capital was actually used .  China ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of assimilating foreign direct investment .  
The 14th Party Congress called for developing the socialist market economy .  The foreign trade system has been reformed in an in-depth manner according to the orientation set forth at the 14th Party Congress - - " unified policies , relaxed management , equal competition , self-responsibility for profits or losses , integration of industry with trade , and implementation of a commission-based system . "  
Therefore , our party is required to deeply understand and acutely grasp the requirement for developing China 's advanced productive forces , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the direction for the advancement of China 's advanced culture , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people in China , to treat the three as an integrated whole , and to genuinely , effectively , and systematically represent them through a set of correct of line , principles , and policies and effective forms .  
Heroic models and advanced typical examples are valuable wealth of our party and the country .  Their lofty thinking is playing an increasingly greater role to influence and lead the people .  Their actions are of great significance to fostering healthy tendencies in the society , developing the spirit of our times and promoting reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
We have actively advocated and safeguarded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics with the strong domineering over the weak .  We have upheld principle and justice , striving to let justice prevail and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the vast developing countries , and pushed the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .  
It was precisely because of this that Dr . Sun Yat-sen emphasized the importance of developing our own culture while speaking about nationalism despite controversial views and the strong atmosphere of opposing what was traditional in the academic circles .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that China and India are two biggest developing countries of the world .  Both of them face the tasks of developing the economy and improving the people 's living standard and need a peaceful and stable surrounding environment .  
In meeting with delegates , CPC General Secretary and State Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed that adhering to carrying out the basic national policy of opening up to the outside , attracting more and better foreign capital and developing an open-style economy will be of major significance in furthering the continued rapid and healthy development of our national economy .  
In this speech , standing in the forefront of the times , setting his feet on new practice , and mastering the features of the times , Comrade Jiang Zemin applied the basic theory of Marxism to have studied and answered the important issues about the practice of building socialism , deepened the understanding about the laws governing communist parties holding power , governing the building of socialism , and governing the development of human society , thus making new contributions to enriching and developing Marxism .  
According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .  By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
Despite the fact that the current situation at home and abroad is favorable to us , we must soberly realize that China is developing its modernization program in a more complicated international environment .  Right now , the world is undergoing profound changes .  It is becoming more and more multi-polarized , and continuously marching toward economic globalization .  
Our workers in the field of philosophy and social science should follow Secretary Jiang 's demands and " take our direction from Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , planting our feet on the real achievements of constructing a Chinese-style socialism , setting our eyes on the progress of development of world social science and culture , and constantly developing healthy , upward striving , rich and colorful socialism with Chinese style and special Chinese characteristics . "  
Just after the Bush Administration was inaugurated , it adopted a rightist and extremist policy toward China , which not only was not in line with the norms of international law , but also eroded US consortiums ' interests in developing economic relations with China and ran counter to US allies ' middle-course and moderate policies toward China . The Bush Administration 's reckless moves were questioned and contained by people in the United States as well as US allies .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
This treaty will become a legal document guiding the development of bilateral relations in the new century , and it is bound to have a far-reaching positive impact on the two countries in developing enduring good neighborly , friendly , and mutual beneficial and cooperative relations .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
At present , both China and Russia are shouldering the heavy tasks of developing the domestic economy , maintaining national unity , defending independence and sovereignty , and safeguarding their respective proper positions and legitimate rights in the international community .  
Today 's Tibet is a picture of vigor and prosperity as the economy is developing , society is making progress , the various ethnic groups are united , the situation is stable , the border defense is solid and the people are leading a peaceful and contented life .  
Jiang Zemin said : China has always paid great attention to developing relations with Belarus and respected the choice Belarus made on its development approach and its internal and foreign policy .  China supports the efforts of Belarus to oppose any foreign interference and to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
The hosting of the Olympic Games and entry to the World Trade Organization are bound to redouble the strength of the Chinese economy , which is already developing in a sound and rapid manner .  China 's overall national strength and international status will certainly grow rapidly , thus laying a solid material foundation for the reunification of the motherland .  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
President Jiang Said : " In this visit to your honorable country , I want to increase my understanding of your honorable country ; to exchange deep ideas with president De Marko and other leaders of your honorable country concerning developing relations between our two countries , and international problems of mutual concern ; to have broad contact with people in various fields in your country - - doing all this to increase the friendship between the people 's of the two countries , and to propel the development of Sino-Maltese relations to a new standard . 
Despite Pronk 's proposal not being completely satisfactory , developing countries , keeping in mind the general interests of improving the international ecological environment , finally agreed to accept Pronk 's proposal in order to enable the " Kyoto Protocol " to go into force at an early date and to compel developed countries to take practical and effective measures to reduce greenhouse gases emissions .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Although it is extensively opposed by the international community , including US allies , development of the missile defense system is expected to require over $ 100-billion .  Despite the current unsolvable technical difficulty , the United States has hardened its determination to act its own way in developing and deploying the missile defense system .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
In order to further improve the global development environment , the developing and the developed countries should continue to promote reforms in the international financial setup , launch a new round of WTO trade negotiations , narrow the development gap between the developing and the developed countries , and work together to build a more fair and rational new international economic order .  
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
We must adhere to taking irrigation as the focus of basic agricultural construction , continuing the reform of mid-level production fields , developing high yield , stable yield , water economizing , and highly effective agricultural fields , effectively consolidating , protecting , and raising the production capabilities of China 's basic agricultural fields . b ) .  
Taking the overall interests into consideration under such circumstances , the Netherlands and other EU nations brought forward a compromise package proposal which , on the one hand , allows advanced nations to use the total area of green resources , such as forests and vegetation , to make up for their emission cuts ; on the other hand , the proposal also makes advanced nations promise to provide investment for developing countries for environmental protection purposes .  That was how an agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions was finally reached .  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
They should adapt to the new situation in the context of developing a socialist market economy and free themselves , once and for all , from the ideas , concepts , and approaches of work formed under the system of planned economy .  They should take a step further and change their function from predominantly regulating country markets to regulating the unified national market and from managing the market by mainly relying on administrative means to managing the market by law .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
An economic and trade delegation of the Chinese Government , headed by He Xiaowei , assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , paid an official visit to Macedonia on 29-30 July . During the visit , the delegation discussed with the Macedonian side on the issue of resuming and developing bilateral economic and trade relations , held talks with Mazuowa , undersecretary of the Macedonian Ministry of Economy , and also met Filipovski , deputy prime minister in charge of economic cooperation .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
It was an important material foundation for economic growth , technological progress , and social stability in the developed countries after World War II , where lay the crucial reason for the economic backwardness and social poverty of developing countries .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
He said , developing good neighborly and friendly relations between the DPRK and Russia is in the fundamental interests of both countries , and there are tremendous potentials for bilateral cooperation in the economic , military , and cultural fields .  
Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the vast number of intellectuals has demonstrated their unprecedented initiative and creativity .  Scientists and technical experts , taking aim at the world 's cutting-edge technologies , are working with daring in scaling the heights of science and technology ; and they have achieved great successes in developing proprietary high technologies , which are close to or have reached the world 's advanced levels .  
Government departments must concentrate their energy in doing well macroeconomic control and creating a fine market environment .  In accordance with the demands of government operations laws and economic development laws , we must adjust the direct intervention of government in economic activities , changing the scope of this involvement to a more rational level , such as primarily organizing the production of public goods , developing public benefit undertakings , and providing public services .  
We should learn from them their true political qualities of carrying forward and developing the glorious traditions of our party and our army , consciously resisting temptations , firmly holding the defense line , and always " resisting and keeping away from corrosive influences . "  We should learn from them their up-to-the-mark work style of running the inspection post strictly , ensuring a strict enforcement of the law , stressing on decorum , and observing discipline .  
Investment projects in these areas will include building roads and water and power supply systems in the rural areas , building permanent and semi-permanent housings for herdsmen in a way according to the local situations , intensifying comprehensive agricultural development , and developing the Brahmaputra [ the Yaluzangbu Jiang ] and two other rivers , as well as developing animal husbandry in northern Tibet .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .  
We must do a good job in resolving problems of the current livelihood and long-term production development for peasants where farmland is bring returned to forest , and support the peasants in developing industries for which there are strong local resources and which meet market needs ; through developing small hydroelectric stations , methane , and so on , we should resolve the problems of the peasants ' fuel and rural energy , prevent indiscriminate tree-felling , and protect the results of returning farmland to forest .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that speeding up the perfection of the social security system is the urgent requirement of preserving social stability and consolidating and developing the current good development momentum , and is also a strategic move for achieving lasting political stability .  
Moreover , the functions of the SDF 's weapons have also been changing rapidly from " defensive " to " offensive . "  Besides the weapons that will be researched and developed with major efforts as stipulated in the " Guidelines on R &amp; D Implementation , " Japan will regard developing its armament as its principal tasks in the future .  It will equip with highly mobile armored combat vehicles .  
Because Japanese society widely considers that neighboring countries all have requests and think that Japanese economic aid and science and technology are critical to many developing Asian nations , therefore even if people have been " offended " on the historical issue , this is of no significance and will not hinder Japan from becoming an " international country , " to the point of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council .  
He was very happy to learn that a large number of peasants had extricated themselves from poverty and become rich through growing Chinese medicinal herbs and promoting special livestock breeding .  Hu Jintao said : Yanbian is richly endowed by nature and enjoys good prospects in developing industries along specialized lines .  
The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
Indeed , the regiment 's " red unit " and " blue unit " managed to refine each other 's tactics step by step during each round of fighting , by exposing each other 's loopholes , refining each other 's tactics , improving each other 's training plans , developing new tactics , and conducting training in light of a real war .  
Zhang Deguang said , as a result of more than 10 years of accumulated experience , China and Russia have built a whole set of effective mechanisms for developing good neighborliness , friendship , and strategic coordination , from the periodic meetings of their heads of state and heads of government to bilateral direct contacts between counterpart departments .  These mechanisms involve various fields such as politics , economics , and science and technology , and they are being more and more perfected and standardized .  
He said : China persistently pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy , developing friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , treating each other equally , enjoying mutual benefits , and jointly forging ahead the cause of human progress .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
In respect of science , education , and qualified personnel , it is necessary to strengthen compulsory and elementary education , make a breakthrough in developing high-tech projects , import qualified personnel from other regions and , at the same time , train local talented personnel , bringing into full play the initiative of the existing talent .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
Those attending the forum said : President Jiang Zemin 's speech gave a systematic , complete , and incisive explanation on Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " and put forward an eight-point proposal for further developing cross-strait relations and promoting the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland in the current stage .  This fully reflected the determination and sincerity of the CPC and the Chinese Government to develop cross-strait relations and promote the reunification of the motherland and expressed all the Chinese people 's aspiration for reunification .  
The article stresses : As the " Taiwan Security Enhancement Act " bill has directly undermined all the efforts of China and the United States in improving and developing bilateral relations since they established diplomatic relations in 1979 , violated the " one-China " principled stand , and directly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  In reality , not only can Taiwan 's security not be ensured , but it will also intensify the situation in the Taiwan Strait and regional arms race and further push Taiwan toward war .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
According to the plan of the China Power Company , in the next 15 years , China will lay stress on developing hydropower plants in the western region .  The goal is to realize " sending electric power from the west to the east " and establish a national joint power supply network .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .  
Ye Xuanping also summed up the new progress made by the CPPCC National Committee in making the democratic channels unimpeded and reflecting the social situation and popular will , safeguarding unity and stability and developing the united front , unfolding non-government diplomacy and expanding friendly contacts , and strengthening its own construction and improving the work of its organs .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
Addressing a group discussion held by the Inner Mongolia delegation on the afternoon of 5 March , Buhe , vice chairman of the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee , said : Premier Zhu Rongji 's government work report stressed the strategy of actively developing west China and the issues of expeditiously developing central and west China . This is an important and very popular policy decision .  It has a strategic significance whereby if we can properly accomplish this task , other regions will also be invigorated .  
Minister Zhu said that the reason for prominently emphasizing further strengthening technological renovation and regarding technological renovation , developing high technology , and realizing the industrialization of high technology as work that has a bearing on the future and destiny of the country is closely related to the changes in the general international economic environment and the fact that China 's economy and technology have developed to a considerable stage .  
We should realize that more than half of China 's 20 [ as published ] or so counties are in financial dire straits and are economically backward .  If the county towns ' economies make some progress , there will be hope for radical improvement in the Chinese economy .  Therefore in the new round of economic development , we should put our energy into developing the county towns .  
By the end of 1997 , there were 7,617 environmental protection enterprises in China , with the total fixed assets amounting to 62.09 billion yuan .  They have formed a pattern under which the state-owned enterprises are developing alongside the township collective enterprises and private enterprises .  
In the developing countries , the rise of commodity prices as a result of the growing financial deficits is mainly attributed to the lack of material reserves .  In the mainland , the commodity prices are falling now , and the situation is different from that in other developing countries , because it has sufficient material reserves , which will not give rise to a new round of inflation .  There is not any sign of a new round of inflation in the mainland at present .  
Facts have proved that the " one country , two systems " concept is not utopia or an expedient measure .  It is a scientific idea with great vitality and more room for development .  It is the only way out for a developing country to settle the problems left over from history and solidify and arouse all forces that can be aroused to make the country more powerful and prosperous .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
emphasizing priority areas of scientific and technological development , an approach under which the state should give priority support to strategically significant technologies , support production enterprises with high and new technologies , and support , on a priority basis , the work of developing techniques with high technological levels which lead the world in the relevant research fields , which contain creative elements capable of establishing new scientific and technological bases , and which have been generally recognized at home and abroad .  
Since his assuming the post of the chairman of the government in September last year and becoming the acting president at the end of December , Putin has repeatedly expressed that he will persist in developing and deepening the Sino-Russia strategic partnership of cooperation [ zhong e zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi 0022 0192 2096 3970 0588 0155 0129 0133 7070 0190 ] and will consider Sino-Russian relations as the cornerstone of Russian foreign affairs .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
In agricultural production , on the basis of protecting the production capability of grain and other essential agricultural products , stress should be put on the optimization of varieties and the enhancement of quality and efficiency with a view to comprehensively optimizing crop varieties , painstakingly raising the quality of agricultural produce , positively developing animal husbandry and aquaculture , heightening the added value transformed from the processing of agricultural produce , and repeatedly increasing peasants ' income .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .  
That the United States has always ignored facts , played the same old tune , and slandered the situation of human rights in China and other developing countries is caused by its hegemonic mental state of Cold War mentality .  It has implemented its values and ideology with a strong sense of superiority , practiced dual standards on the human rights issue , and politicized the human rights issue .  
Narayanan said : India and China are the world 's two largest developing countries .  Strengthening bilateral cooperation is conducive to the development of the two countries and their mutual trust , as well as to the establishment of a rational international economic and political structure .  India and China both undertake major responsibilities in the world .  
The spokesman for the Great Hall Industrial Company pointed out : We have noticed that recently the US media have devoted lots of space to carrying reports which state that the US State Department claimed that in the course of developing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological assistance from the Lockheed Martin Company .  
On 6 April , the " Washington Post " " New York Times " and other media in the United States devoted a large space to the report that the US State Department claimed that in the process of developing and manufacturing the perigee solid satellite motor ( EPKM ) in 1994 , it is possible that China received technological aid from the Lockheed Martin Company , and this has aroused the concerns of the Chinese and US space technology circles .  
Both countries are developing counties ; and it is the hope of our both countries to give form to a peaceful , stable , fair , and rational international political and economic new order at an early date .  
He urged the US side to promptly complete a full and thorough investigation on the " bombing incident " and severely punish responsible persons so as to have a satisfactory answer to the Chinese Government and people and be conducive to ending the past and ushering in the future and creating a good foundation and atmosphere for improving and developing military relations between the two countries .  
We should discard as soon as possible the old method of relying on the pricing mechanism and replace it with a new strategy : increasing the input of production elements , including capital , manpower , science and technology ; developing high-yield , special , and fine-quality agriculture as well as environment-friendly green agriculture ; raising the per-unit-area output of farm produce ; lowering production costs ; increasing returns ; and boosting farmers ' income without changing the procurement prices for agricultural products .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
In respect of science , education , and qualified personnel , it is necessary to strengthen compulsory and elementary education , make a breakthrough in developing high-tech projects , import qualified personnel from other regions and , at the same time , train local talented personnel , bringing into full play the initiative of the existing talent .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
Those attending the forum said : President Jiang Zemin 's speech gave a systematic , complete , and incisive explanation on Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " and put forward an eight-point proposal for further developing cross-strait relations and promoting the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland in the current stage .  This fully reflected the determination and sincerity of the CPC and the Chinese Government to develop cross-strait relations and promote the reunification of the motherland and expressed all the Chinese people 's aspiration for reunification .  
The article stresses : As the " Taiwan Security Enhancement Act " bill has directly undermined all the efforts of China and the United States in improving and developing bilateral relations since they established diplomatic relations in 1979 , violated the " one-China " principled stand , and directly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  In reality , not only can Taiwan 's security not be ensured , but it will also intensify the situation in the Taiwan Strait and regional arms race and further push Taiwan toward war .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
According to the plan of the China Power Company , in the next 15 years , China will lay stress on developing hydropower plants in the western region .  The goal is to realize " sending electric power from the west to the east " and establish a national joint power supply network .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .

We must comport ourselves like Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , being undaunted by setbacks , not fearing any difficulties or adversity , staunchly developing the common ideal of socialism with special Chinese characteristics .  In the advance of reform and economic development , we must fully confidentially complete the lofty mission bestowed upon us by history and the times .  
Introducing the practice of a comprehensive agricultural development which mainly aims at strengthening the building of basic agricultural facilities , protecting and improving the ecological environment , and developing a high-quality agriculture with a high yield and a high efficiency conforms to the requirements of the WTO 's " green box " policy ; and is also an important way for the government to support and protect agriculture at a time when China 's agriculture is heading for internationalization , he stressed .  
Chi Haotian said : Since China and Azerbaijan established diplomatic ties , bilateral ties have developed smoothly .  The Chinese armed forces have paid attention to developing friendly ties with the Azerbaijani armed forces .  China would also like to develop multilevel exchanges between the two armies in various fields on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit .  
Without PNTR , China eventually will still join the WTO , but if following China 's WTO entry , such factors of disharmony still exist in Sino-US relations , China 's development after WTO entry will be subject to the negative impact of conservative forces coming from within the United States and from Congress , which is unfavorable to China in its bid to make better use of the opportunity of WTO entry to do such things as investing , developing foreign economic and trade connections , and system reform .  
On cross-strait relations , he attempted to avoid one China , which is " fundamental " and adopted some soft means to strive to create some " obscure and blurred space , " so as to resist the appeal of the mainland motherland for developing cross-strait relations and starting political negotiations under the principle of one China .  
The side of the mainland motherland has also repeatedly expressed welcoming the visits of all the political parties , organizations , and personages from all circles in Taiwan , so as to exchange views and enhance common understanding on jointly opposing " Taiwan independence , " developing cross-strait relations , and pushing forward the progress of peaceful reunification .  
She indicated that real strength is the key in participating in international competition , and that improving real strength , such as developing industrial and agricultural product quality , invariably relies on science and technology .  
On the other hand , the desire for peace , cooperation , and development has become an irresistible trend of the times .  The voice of the vast numbers of developing countries demanding dialogue and countering confrontation , safeguarding the purpose and principles of the UN Charter , and fighting against the use of human rights to meddle in the internal affairs of other countries , is running high .  
Wei Jianxing pointed out : China and Indonesia , both important developing countries , are facing the same tasks of invigorating the economy , improving people 's standards of living , and safeguarding the just rights and interests of developing countries .  There exist enormous potential and a bright future for their cooperation in wide-ranging areas .  
At the turn of the century , when the international situation is complicated and ever changing , strengthening and developing Sino-DPRK friendly relations not only is in line with the common wish and fundamental interests of the people of the two countries , but also is conducive to peace and stability in this region as well as of the world .  
Through structural adjustment , we need to improve grain production in both breadth and depth , to convert from common varieties to quality and exclusive varieties , from the single production of grain to the overall development of grain plus diversified operations , and from simply providing primary farm products to developing the intensive processing of farm and sideline products .  
It is in the course of developing normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries and in its struggle aimed at safeguarding China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that the Chinese Government has adhered to the One China principle and has won both understanding and support from a growing number of countries and international organizations .  
Li Peng , member of the Standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , stressed at the forum : In developing the western regions , we must properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; ensure a benign cycle for resources exploitation and ecological protection ; and leave our future generations with space for sustainable development .  
The path for carrying on and developing knowledge lies with grasping the scientific and technological achievements accumulated by our predecessors , developing what is useful and discarding what is not , and establishing new knowledge as well as spreading knowledge to society , continuing to successive generations , and a constant transformation into productive force and social wealth .  
Deng Xiaoping first readjusted the past practice of using the social system and ideology as a line of demarcation and advocated proceeding from the national strategic interests in handling state-to-state relations , transcending the similarities and differences in social systems and ideology , giving no thought to historical resentment , refraining from engaging in ideological disputes , and developing relations with all countries in accordance with the norms of international relations .  
Attention should be paid to increasing the proportion of the third industry , and greatly strengthening the economic vitality of the entire city , while at the same time putting a great effort behind promoting technological updates .  Enterprises developing new high technologies should be put in a prominent position , to allow manufacturing to develop in a reasonable direction .  
She pointed out : China hopes the US Senate will make a wise move to settle China 's permanent normal trade relations [ PNTR ] issue as soon as possible [ jin zao ] .  An early settlement of the issue will be conducive to smoothly developing Sino-US ties and to facilitating a smooth and healthy development of Sino-US economic and trade ties .  
At the Sino-DPRK summit , leaders of the two countries unanimously held that at the turn of the century when the international situation is complicated and ever-changing , consolidating and developing Sino-DPRK friendly relations is not only in accord with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the people of the two countries but also beneficial to peace and stability in the region and the world as well .  
Under the current social conditions where China is carrying out reform , opening up , and developing the market economy , the broad masses of academicians and scientists of the older generation should pay special attention to teaching , helping , and guiding the younger generation ideologies , work style , and academic attitudes .  They should teach them to inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of patriotism and to consolidate their determination to devote their lives to scientific undertakings and their confidence to attain new accomplishments .  
Li Lanqing said at the end : To popularize scientific knowledge across the whole society , to establish scientific thinking , to promote scientific spirit , and to publicize scientific methods suit the need for implementing the strategy of developing China through science and education , for upgrading the masses ' qualities , and for facilitating a healthy development in our socialist material and spiritual civilization construction .  The tasks also suit the need for eliminating the poison inflicted by ignorance , superstition , various pseudosciences , and antisciences ; for safeguarding social stability ;  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
To be sure , we are fully aware that China is a developing country with over 1.2 billion inhabitants , a weak economic base , a low per-capita output value , and imbalance between its different parts in their economic development standards .  Therefore , we have put forth an important strategy to promote the development of west China .  
As a result , although the labor productivity of agriculture in developing countries is the same as that of the industrial sector which is considerably lower than that in advanced countries , the domestic prices of primary agricultural products and their processed and manufactured goods are generally lower than the prices in the international markets , thus enjoying an absolute advantage .  
At the Foreign Ministry news conference held today , in responding to a relevant question raised by a reporter , the spokesman reiterated : The statement which says China has probably acquired technical assistance from Lockheed Martin in the process of developing the satellite perigee kick motor is entirely groundless .  
In international competition , he stated , the developing nations are subject to restrictions in their domestic systems , policies , and knowledge .  As a result , they are in an unequal status in the course of international competition and are usually fragile in the face of international financial market risks .  
Correctly understanding their distinctive mentalities and behaviors is the basis for setting the goals , assignments , and requirements and developing the methods for ideological and political construction .  It is also the premise for making ideological and political work more relevant , systematic , and creative .  
In the Drought Agriculture Ecology Laboratory , which is a key state project , a young professor gave Jiang Zemin an account of one of their scientific research achievements : In view of the unique drought and cold geographical conditions of the west region , Professor Zhao Songlin , the first director of the laboratory , proposed a brand new idea of developing " catchment type ecological agriculture , " which was successful in practice .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
It is not the product of wishful thinking that China and the United States should work for establishing a " constructive strategic partnership . "  It is based on their common needs .  It helps the governments of the two countries to grasp the major orientation in developing bilateral relations .  
At present the world situation is experiencing important and profound changes ; as two major developing countries , China and Iran are facing many common tasks and challenges , and share the same or similar views on many international and regional issues .  The Chinese side is willing to strive for new progress through joint efforts in the long-term and stable relationship of friendship and cooperation in the new century .  
In launching economic construction , the national defense mobilization systems of the various provinces and autonomous regions are participating in the setting of consolidated plans of large and mid-size cities and of plans for economic mobilization development .  They have developed 1,080,000 square meters of underground air raid shelters , and have newly constructed 170,000 square meters of air raid shelters .  Useful for developing commerce and trade , the projects have achieved annual production value of nearly 500 million yuan , and have provided employment opportunities for over 10,000 laid off or unemployed persons .  
through the struggle during the period of reform , our party did away with the shortcomings of the economic , political , science , educational , cultural , and other systems that were unable to meet demand of further development of productive forces , thus further liberating and developing productive forces .  
In the final analysis , all struggles carried out by our party were aimed at liberating and developing productive forces ; and all guiding principles and policies adopted by our party are aimed at eventually ensuring continuous development of productive forces , boosting national economic development , raising the overall national strength , building socialist material and spiritual civilizations , satisfying the people 's increasing material and cultural needs , and becoming more representative of the people 's fundamental interests .  
In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .  
As a matter of fact , it is impossible for the Chinese enterprises to head for the entire world without choice now .  We should first proceed from our own comparative advantages to select those regions that have their own comparative advantages , and make investment and set up factories there .  For instance , we should first gain access to the developing countries , the states of the former Soviet Union , the regions adjacent to West China , and so on .  
China today is still a developing country with 1.25 billion people .  Our economic foundation is still fragile .  Although our national strength has grown somewhat , I am afraid that we can not reach the level of an intermediate developed country until the middle of the 21st century .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
The criteria for judging all party tasks should be whether they are conducive to liberating and developing the productive forces ; to reinforcing the comprehensive national strength of a socialist state ; and to raising the living standard .  
integrated reform efforts , development speed , and social capacity for acceptance ; and formulated a series of principles and policies on developing the productive forces .  We should seize opportunities and advance in an enterprising spirit so as to secure a new great victory in reform , opening up , and socialist modernization .  
Chinese leaders have repeatedly pointed out that insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other " persistent economic ailments " are still obstructing China 's economy from developing in a sustained and healthy manner .  
China and Germany hold identical or similar views on a series of important international issues .  Our two countries are economically highly complementary to one another , and have established extensive and well-founded cooperation in many fields .  The potential of further developing friendly relations is huge and the prospects are broad .  
During her recent inspection tour of Guizhou , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , emphasized the necessity of seriously studying a series of important instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on developing the western region , firmly seizing the historical opportunity for developing the western region , further emancipating the mind , changing concepts , boldly using foreign and domestic funds , opening up wider , and promoting development .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .

The other characteristic is that industrial structural readjustment is carried out with a view to not only continuing the completion of industrialization and the shift of agricultural labor to non-farming sectors through industrialization but also propelling industrialization with informationization , transforming and upgrading the traditional agriculture and industry , and vigorously developing the modern tertiary industry that uses more science and technology and provides greater avenues for employment .  
We should take a lead in socialist spiritual civilization construction .  We should further foster close ties between the military and the government as well as between the military and the people .  We should continuously make new contributions in promoting coordinated economic and social development , in consolidating and developing China 's political stability , and in creating a good situation of social stability .

China has all along attached importance to developing friendly relations with Syria and has spoken highly of Syria 's long-term firm support for China on the issues of human rights and Taiwan .  
He said : While globalization is developing rapidly , the global management system is obviously lagging behind .  There is an urgent need for the international community to formulate coherent and effective management strategies , conduct reforms on current global economic system , so that the system will represent the interests of the great majority .  Accordingly , it will be guaranteed that all countries , especially the developing countries , will be able to enjoy the benefits fairly brought about by globalization , so as to realize the goal of eliminating poverty and achieving sustained development .  
Facing the increasing pressure , it is necessary that the developing countries make great efforts to overcome difficulties , base themselves on the specific national conditions of their own , adopt feasible development strategies , and work hard to eliminate poverty and achieve sustained development .  
On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
China has consistently attached importance to its relations with Mongolia , and is willing to make unremitting efforts for consolidating and developing long-term and stable Sino-Mongolian good neighborly and friendly cooperative relations which is healthy , based on mutual trust , and geared toward the 21st century .  
Wei Jianxing reiterated that the CPC is willing to develop fresh inter-party exchange and cooperation with the MPRP on the principle of independence and self-determination , total equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in domestic affairs , so as to make new contributions to developing Sino-Mongolian good neighborly and friendly cooperative relations .  
I hope the vast number of companies involved in every link of modern logistics , including procurement , manufacturing , storage , transportation , consignment , delivery , and marketing , would seize the good opportunity to learn from the advanced experience of developed countries in developing modern logistics , integrate the experience with China 's reality , work hard to explore , push forward the integration of modern logistics and E-Commerce in China , and raise the level of China 's modern logistics as quickly as possible .

"  The stability and continuity of the policy should be maintained .  
We should seize the two major opportunities where the state is implementing the strategy of actively developing China 's west regions and where Tibet is stable socially .  Furthermore , we should apply creative concepts and systems as well as innovative science and technology to attain economic and social progress by leaps and bounds .  To constantly represent the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , we have to carry out the following tasks : We should establish a Marxist cultural concept .  
We should persistently rectify and eliminate chaos and ignorance .  We should establish constructive models while eliminating negative ones in accordance with the policy of promoting positive examples while discarding bad elements .  We should correctly handle the ties between the inheritance and creation of nationalities ' traditional culture , increase cultural exchanges among fraternal nationalities , absorb the accomplishments of all the civilizations of mankind , and upgrade the educational level of Tibet 's various nationalities so as to provide powerful spiritual driving force and intellectual support for developing Tibet into a new socialist region .  
Li Peng pointed out : Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , guided by the basic principle of developing the socialist democracy and amplifying the socialist legal system proposed by the party 's central committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping , China 's legislative work has scored spectacular achievements .  
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .

Also , both China and Thailand are developing countries and both are facing the arduous tasks of developing our respective economies and improving our peoples ' living standard .  We hold identical or close viewpoints on many important regional and global issues .  
Shi Guangsheng added : APEC should impel the WTO to work out an agenda for the new round of talks , which will balance and reflect the interests of all parties , those of the developing member countries in particular , resolve the problems that the vast number of developing countries are concerned about , and strive to make the results of talks conducive to the establishment of a still fairer and opener multilateral trade structure , so as to play a positive role in promoting the economic development of all member countries .  
The important purpose of systemic innovation is to overcome the factors in the relations of production and the superstructure that hinder the development of the productive forces and to keep liberating and developing the productive forces .  We should uphold the basic economic system under which the socialist public ownership is dominant while economic sectors of diverse forms of ownership develop side by side ;  
He said that China and Sudan have a common language on many issues and are faced with the complex and ever-changing international situation ; the Chinese side is willing to continue increasing coordination and cooperation with Sudan and make concerted efforts to establish a new international political and economic order characterized by fairness and rationality , and to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries .  
The broad mass of developing countries face the arduous dual tasks of not only having to exert great efforts to transform their traditional industries but also striving to develop new industries , or it will be hard for them to realize virtuous development of their economies and to deal with harsh challenges brought about by the development of the global economy . 
Wei Jianxing added : China and the Dominican Republic are developing countries .  We are devoted to defending world peace , invigorating our national economy and improving our people 's living standard .  
They stressed that a healthy and fair multilateral trade system will improve the sustainable and stable growth of world trade and promote common prosperity for both the developed nations and the developing nations .  
As President Jiang Zemin pointed out , whatever difficulties there are in Sino-US relations , so long as the governments and leaders of the two countries have strong confidence and resolve in developing their bilateral ties , dare to face the challenges and difficulties , be bold in clearing away various kinds of interference and obstacle , hold firm to the main orientation of the development of their bilateral ties , maintain close contact , and stop up consultation , they will be able to push the continual development of bilateral ties .

Shi Guangsheng said that although the bilateral trade value still accounts for a small proportion in the current foreign trade volumes of the two countries , China and Bahrain have great potential for further developing trade , contractual projects , cooperative labor services , and investment .

The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
The Communist Party of China , which is now leading the Chinese people to carry out reform , opening up , and socialist modernization construction , is willing to continue developing friendly and cooperative relations with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the basis of the principle of " independence , autonomy , complete equality , mutual respect , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .

Shanghai 's decision-makers began to open the gate to liberalize their thinking and lost no time in coming up with a new industrial strategy to " give priority to developing the tertiary industry , readjust and transform the secondary industry , and steadily upgrade the primary industry . "  It boldly changed the several-decade-old " 2-3-1 " industrial development order to the " 3-2-1 " order .  
Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , considerable headway has been made in developing socialist democracy and perfecting the socialist legal system in China , and the framework of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics that takes the constitution as the core has shaped up , which has laid a solid foundation for the practice of governing the country according to law and the building of a socialist country ruled by law .  
With reference to these issues , the city party committee organized people concerned to earnestly study relevant documents and analyze the case example of former city mayor Mo Miaorong who took up the road of crime , and let the people concerned understand that under the new situation of carrying out reform and opening up and developing socialist market economy , in order to keep cool-headedness and withstand rigorous tests , leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy tendencies . 
With reference to the disastrous consequences brought about by the drastic changes in the former Soviet Union and East Europe to the countries and peoples there as well as the development of the socialist undertakings since the founding of PRC 50 years ago , especially the brilliant achievements attained since reform and opening up over the last 20 years in China , they more deeply understand that the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only correct road for consolidating and developing socialism in China , realizing national rejuvenation , and making China powerful and prosperous .  
As developing countries , China and Armenia should strengthen cooperation ; in light of their respective strong points , they should explore together new ways and spheres of economic and trade cooperation suited to their national conditions and also to the laws of market economy and international convention , and promote the all-round development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation . 
Long Yongtu said : The increasing flow of foreign capital into China is neither based on the condition of decreasing the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries , nor will it have a significant impact on the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries .  Currently , the world 's foreign capital is mainly flowing into developed countries .  
It is not likely that the additional foreign capital that has flowed into China will change the general pattern of the capital flow in the world , or affect the amount of foreign capital flowing into developing countries .  A large project given to China may give rise to the construction of supporting production networks in surrounding countries , thereby enabling these countries to obtain even more foreign capital .  This shows even more clearly the economic ties and complementary nature of China and other developing countries .  
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .

It is even more serious that where there is oppression , there is resistance , which is an ironclad law in history .  The waves of impoverished developing countries opposing the developed countries headed by the United States will certainly surge higher and higher , class struggle will move from a country to the entire world , and the era of peace and development will come to an end , which will be replaced by the new round of revolution and war on a global scale .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
As far as developing countries are concerned , the benefits brought by TNCs are plain to see ; for instance , they have made tremendous contributions to promoting economic development in the host countries , providing job opportunities , introducing advanced technology and management experience , stimulating the development of trade , perfecting the market structure , improving competitiveness , and so on , and many countries have enthusiastically opened their doors to these companies .  
In recent years foreign investment by developed countries has tended to be concentrated in a number of sectors which require small investment , yield high profit , and are regionally concentrated ; this not only runs counter to the goal of the host countries in making efforts to develop hi-tech industry , but is also extremely prone to result in foreigners controlling the pattern of industry and domestic market , and this directly endangers the economic lifelines of the developing countries .  
Sichuan has actively implemented the strategic policy decisions of the central authorities regarding the " great development of the western region , " and has put forth the overall working idea of building Sichuan - - with 10 years of struggle - - into an economic powerhouse province in China 's western region and an ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , of harmoniously developing the economy and society , and of realizing new strides . 
For one reason or another , however , underworld evil forces are still developing and spreading in some localities in these years , and they are swollen with arrogance .

With respect to the reform of the circulation methods , we must put the emphasis on promoting chain operations , material circulation and allocation and delivery , multi-formatted through-transport , and other organizational forms and service formats .  Today , it is especially important to pay attention to developing material circulation and allocation and delivery and use modern management methods and service techniques to transform traditional commerce and increase the technological content and raise service standard to promote the rise in the overall standard of the circulation industry .  
China 's economic development potentials and its vast potential market , the unique role it plays in Asian affairs , its political influence among the developing countries , its special geopolitical status and future prospects of " great China " [ da zhong hua ] , and the acceleration of its military modernization - - all these factors mean that the US government and public can not but attach greater importance to China 's weight in the future international political pattern and its influence in world affairs .

Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
An IQ of from 50 to 70 is considered mildly retarded ; the focus of education is similar to that of ordinary children , with more emphasis on practical applied learning . People with IQs from 35 to 50 are classified as moderately retarded , with the focus of education placed on taking care of one 's own daily necessities , communication with others , developing job skills , and basic knowledge .  
Given that in some areas of Taiwan local residents have made a killing by developing the seafood industry by raising fish in nearby shallows , Lu Tao fishermen are even more unsettled because they are restricted from doing the same by the environmental protection regulations of the ECNSAA .  
Wang Chen-yi , secretary-general of the Association of Taiwanese Ballads , who has been to the mainland many times , contends that as ko-tzai-hsihas been developing for less than 100 years , it has the special characteristic of being thoroughly plain and simple . For example , singing is done in a natural voice , with the transitions gentle . Movements are smoother , more suave , closer to the style of southerners .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
The National Film Archive took the films to a developing company , which gave them an ultrasonic cleaning , repaired the sections that were ripped and falling apart and then used all sorts of special printing machines and chemical techniques to blow up the negatives one frame at a time . Now the films look pretty much like they did back when they were released . All told , in personnel and materials , it cost about NT $ 400,000 to have these films preserved for another 50 years . "  
On the one hand he hoped that his eldest daughter , who once dyed her hair purple and even planned to get herself tattooed , would start acting less like a foreigner and more like a Chinese ; but more importantly , over the last decade the North American economy had been going steadily downhill , while Taiwan had been developing far better than he had ever expected , and with family and contacts here , he thought that if his children returned they would have better chances for the future .  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
When Lin Chung-cheng , an Academia Sinica researcher in social sciences , examined the early economic differences between native Taiwanese and mainlanders , he discovered that native businesses tended to take root among the general public and situate themselves in downstream manufacturing , while mainlander businesses were mostly developing upstream supply industries which could avoid the market weakness of insufficient human resources .  
Before the 1970s , ceramic art in Taiwan could only truly be considered a ceramics industry , and was still developing in terms of mass production . Not only was the pottery glazed with few colors , the rate of failure was high , and progress in design was halted at the stage of fake antique flower vases or exported decorative ceramic dolls .  
Later on , despite the establishment of formal governmental offices , the Ching court 's attitude toward Taiwan was merely " to insure that the island remained quiet and posed no threat , " but they had little enthusiasm for positively developing the island . This attitude is evident in the continuing ban on mainland Chinese emigrating to Taiwan even after the integration of the island into the imperial bureaucratic system . ( People got to Taiwan only because the law was not strictly enforced . )  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect . These laid the foundations for the transition from being a developing to being a developed country .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi . And so whether one suffers from a sore back , nagging sore throat , or weak blood and qi ; whether one is male or female , old or young ; there are appropriate prescriptions containing turtle shell that vary according to age and condition .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
When we sat resting on the limestone rocks , gazing down on the little winding path below the mountain and looking up to the blue sky and white clouds , I could n't help fantasizing big economic development schemes to help the people of these remote mountains , like manufacturing Lian Mountain mineral water , bottling fresh Lian Mountain air , building a heliport , or developing a tourist business .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
There are still many tasks for the future . Among the feasible directions for the gay movement would be establishing an information hotline especially for gay issues , making the homosexual movement broader and more in touch with the grass roots level , coordinating groups at various levels , and developing social commentary with a uniquely gay perspective .  
In order to achieve its new goals , the PRC has been buying or developing ( with the help of hired Russian experts ) SU-27 fighters , inter-continental ballistic missiles , and cruise missiles , and is forming a naval task force capable of independent operational capability . General Tang Fei , chief of the ROC general staff , judges that there are a number of objectives behind the PRC 's transformation of its military strategy .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
With its emphasis on " developing qi to relax the body , " and its loose , supple , slow physicality , taijiquan is a contrast to the usual types of exercise favored by today 's well-fed , sedentary city slickers with their hectic lifestyles-activities such as jogging , gym workouts , and aerobics , which contract the muscles and quicken the pulse .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment . Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . " CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
Born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth and well acquainted with the finer privileges in life , she never attended a single day of school in the regular education system , but that has n't kept her from developing into one of Taiwan 's best inkwash artists .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
Although nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases , the controversies that rage over the safety of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste are prohibitive ; nor does the COP encourage countries to develop nuclear energy . Thus , " renewable energy " sources such as wind and solar power , despite the high costs of researching and developing these alternatives , are inevitable . Next year Taiwan Power Company will finally take the plunge and invest a large amount of money in a wind power program .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
In recent years , the AVRDC has also stepped up the economic evaluation of its projects , to assess the socio-economic benefits of improved vegetable varieties and growing methods . One of the major reasons for setting up the AVRDC was the hope that it could promote the cultivation of vegetables of a high nutritional value , to improve the nutritional status and quality of life for the people of many developing countries , and promote those countries ' overall national development .  
As Li Chen-ching explains , the MOE has decided this year to begin a special program for developing short-term researchers in key technology areas . Thirty-five spots will be funded for doctoral candidates recommended by their universities to go abroad to do research in 12 key areas-including nanotechnology , biotechnology , computer science , and microelectronics-for one year . Students need only have their application accepted , and they will be exempted from the normal exams for government scholarships .  
From finding things unacceptable , indecipherable , harsh , and nightmarish , they have been able to put aside their old postures and really change themselves , learning to re-examine themselves and accept new ways of speaking and acting . With the additional help of meditation , visualization , and relaxation exercises , they 've broken through mere habit by developing their inner potential .  
But a year ago when RollCoCo launched another set of cartoon characters called CoCoPlay , featuring four cheeky children wearing animal-head masks , they immediately drew adverse comments such as " Not funny ! " or " Kill them off , do n't make any more ! " so they naturally stopped developing the characters .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time . Generally speaking , once infected , there is a roughly 10% chance of a person developing an active case during the rest of his life . Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
Wu Huang , deputy secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) , explains further : " Precisely because the range of renewable energies is so diverse , each country has to direct its limited resources toward the development of selected areas in which it has an advantage . Thus Germany is developing wind power and Japan hydroelectric power . In Taiwan we hope to achieve a balanced development of hydro , wind , geothermal , biomass and photovoltaic energy sources . "  
Last year , after staff from the Formosa Plastics Group on an overseas inspection tour learned of this mechanism , the company decided to assist Vietnam in developing clean technologies such as cogeneration ( combined heat and power ) and tree planting , and then sell the resulting greenhouse gas reduction credits ( valued at US $ 10 per tonne ) to countries that need them , thus developing a new line of business .  
Since the 1990s ecotourism has exploded , especially in developing nations in Latin America , Africa and Asia where there are rain forests . These nations have established numerous nature preserves and national parks , and their outstanding natural resources and unique cultures have attracted growing numbers of tourists from the developed world .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
She begins by developing their understanding of their bodies through drawing their genitals , giving self-evaluations , charting menstrual cycles , learning to put on a condom , and studying other contraceptive methods before moving on to the psychological side with work on self-affirmation and interpersonal relations . Ultimately , she asks the students to confront the issues of birth , aging , illness and death by having them interview elderly persons , share their feelings about caring for grandparents who have been the victims of strokes , and write a living will .  
According to the godfather of Taiwan 's community colleges , Huang Wu-hsiung , society-based courses ' goal of guiding and shaping their students relies on four things-participation in social activities , confronting the issues facing society , developing a concern for the community , and helping students advance through concrete examples of the ideas and theories taught . Thus the biggest challenge facing community colleges is finding how to bring in people out of the workaday rat race and from sectors of the public who have never really given any concern to civic affairs .  
In order to maintain this environment while also developing the level of the more academic courses we provide , we 've decided that the best choice is to follow the example set by overseas adult education providers and adopt a " twin-track " system .  
" Back in the 1960s and 1970s , increasing food production was an important target of economic planning , " says former Council of Agriculture chairman Peng Tso-kwei . Developing mountain and marine food sources and developing marginal land were central to achieving this objective . The government even established a special Bureau of Mountain Agriculture and Animal Husbandry , as well as another agency to develop land reclaimed from the sea .

On the external debt issue , she said as many developing countries are still faced with the difficulties caused by heavy external debt burdens , it is imperative that further measures aimed at a comprehensive , effective and durable solution of the problem should be explored  
qian noted that the two countries differ greatly in population and size but both , situated in asia pacific region , are developing countries and are confronted with the common task of safeguarding the regional peace , developing their own countries ' economies and raising people 's living standards  
Non governmental exchanges will help establish direct links between cultural groups of the two sides who have common interests However , he added , ethnic characteristics in various cultures must be preserved during the process of developing friendly relationship

Economic services rather than social services constitute the predominant functional category of developing countries ' expenditure , reflecting the overriding priority assigned to economic growth as a major policy goal .  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
With increasing diversity and rapidly changing patterns of international relations , adjustment and economic policy reform for sustained development in developing countries will be a more complex task in the decade ahead .  
We Colombians , for example , have in just a few years achieved significant political , economic and social changes aimed at developing a new democratic century that is more open , more participatory , more pluralistic , more decentralized and more just .  
The economic crises in the developing world have been greatly aggravated : unemployment and economic stagnation have been compounded by persisting problems in international trade , by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials .  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
As has been observed , ethnic tensions have become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies all over the globe - the advanced , the developing , the relatively stable and the unstable alike .  
However , it was observed that developing countries were facing exceptional difficulties in reaching compatible levels of technological development , without which effective and widespread regional science and technology cooperation could not occur .  
In the spirit of developing endogenous capacity , maximum possible use is being made of local consultants , local organizations and local mechanisms , within the overall local social , economic , cultural and political setting .  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Indeed , the promise of global peace and security and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by political and ethnic conflicts , economic and social disorder , and deepening poverty , particularly in developing countries .  
More sustained and intensified international cooperation to provide logistical assistance to developing countries and practical measures against the laundering of drug money are fundamental to effective action to combat drug trafficking .  
For the developing countries , the primary concern is to achieve steady and sizeable rates of economic growth for a better standard of living for their growing population .

A dozen countries in Asia and Latin America , characterized by financial analysts as " emerging markets " , received most of the capital inflow , while the vast majority of developing countries have not been touched by the growth in net financial transfers .  
The globalization of industrial production is likely to proceed at rapid pace and innovative responses will be required to counter growing unemployment and associated social unrest in both industrial and developing countries .  
Despite a renewal in economic growth world wide , the number of people living in absolute poverty has increased in developing and developed regions alike .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into during the recent years was based on the provision to the developing countries of substantial , new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
Most developing countries had implemented economic reforms on the advice of the developed countries and international financial institutions , but at great social and political cost .  
The probability of sustained current recovery in the industrial countries would be greatly enhanced if the international community could take credible actions to realize the tremendous growth potential of developing countries .  
At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
Official development assistance , so important for developing countries that were unable to attract private financial flows , continued to decline both in real terms and in proportion to the gross national product ( GNP ) of developing countries . 
While national Governments were primarily responsible for implementing Agenda 21 and other environmental instruments the developing countries lacked the financial resources and technology to do so without continued and enhanced international cooperation .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
Such cooperation was aimed at preserving the marine environment and living resources , disposing of toxic wastes , developing coastal infrastructure and taking joint action to promote sustainable development in border areas .  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
The international economic situation was such that the efforts made by the developing countries to develop longterm development strategies and lay down sound economic foundations were doomed to failure , thereby exacerbating political tensions .  
It was essential that the international community should recognize the decisive role it had to play in the creation of a favourable external economic environment and improving market access for products from the developing countries .  
An alarming trend was emerging whereby the developed countries were defending civil and political rights , whereas the advocacy of the right to development was being left exclusively to the developing countries .  
As the growing financial obligation which Member States must bear for peacekeeping operations was of vital importance , all countries , developed and developing alike , were encouraged to pay their contributions on time in accordance with their capacity .  
Noting further that the future course of the net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growthoriented supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
" Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
Noting that the future course of the net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growthoriented supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The first involved more efficient prevention , especially to address the problems of victims of internal conflicts , actual or potential victims of the situation in States that have recently emerged from authoritarian rule , and citizens of developing countries in flight from inhuman poverty or socio-economic instability .  
As the international community is aware , the Agreement signed at Chapultepec , Mexico , in January 1992 put an end to the armed conflict in El Salvador , marking the conclusion of the first phase of the peace process but the beginning of a complex and difficult period of transition during which the commitments made served as the framework for a developing political , economic and social process , which we are convinced will culminate in the consolidation of democracy . 
The development of the human and technical resources that are indispensable for the improvement of information and communication systems in developing countries and support for the continuation and strengthening of practical training programmes , such as those already operating under both public and private auspices throughout the developing world ;  
Recommends that actors at all levels , including non-governmental organizations , the private sector and , in particular , local and regional governments , be involved in the development and collection of indicators to meet local needs and monitor local conditions , and that national Governments maintain an enabling and coordinating role to permit the full utilization of local capacity in the process of developing , maintaining and using indicators as part of policy monitoring and evaluation ;  
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
We believe that the gap which exists , in the areas of economic growth and social advancement , between the wealthy industrialized countries , with their enormous economic resources , and the developing countries , is among the most chronic and significant problems that face the international community .  
The recent Conference of non-aligned countries held at Jakarta issued a renewed call for a new orientation between developed and developing countries whereby constructive dialogue and partnership were emphasized , based on a mutuality of interest and benefit , genuine interdependence and shared responsibility .  
What we have in mind is striking the necessary balance between the developed and the developing countries , by reinforcing the Council with a number of developing countries that are capable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable of having the necessary impact at the regional and the international levels , in a manner that would make the Council more representative of international reality and , thereby , much more effective in dealing with international issues .  
There is a need , as a matter of priority that should be addressed with courage and creativity , to reformulate policies and solutions to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries that would help create a climate of equal opportunity amongst peoples and nations and make use of the latent potential of many parts of the world in paving the way towards balanced and comprehensive development at the threshold of the twenty-first century .  
In addition , it is necessary to deal with unjust practices in international economic relations such as coercive economic measures , including boycotts , the freezing of assets , the confiscation of property and the prohibition of the export of spare parts , which has been applied by certain developed countries against a number of developing countries , including my own .  
This remains a major preoccupation , as events since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil conflicts and political instability in many countries , particularly in the developing world , have become endemic , with grave consequences for international peace and security . 
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
Nevertheless , we continue to hold the view that unless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the international community , no meaningful progress for the next 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future by the developing countries , especially the least developed among them .  
The process should be orderly and informed by solid analytical work , with decisions based on rigorous evaluation of the mandates and performance of affected institutions and their relevance to the changing demands of developing countries .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
The United Nations is to be credited with impressive accomplishments in strengthening international peace and security , marshalling the efforts of the international community to put an end to colonialism and apartheid , ensuring the independence and sovereignty of developing countries and supporting their socio-economic development , advocating human rights and fundamental freedoms and protecting and preserving the environment , as well as in promoting education , culture , science and health .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
The pious promises of the developed world to allocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the provision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to non-fulfilment ; the thought of the strong economies helping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun .  
The Republic of China 's standing as the fifteenth largest trading nation in the world , with the twentieth highest gross national product and the largest foreign-exchange holdings , its continuing assistance to many developing countries and its efforts to strengthen international economic cooperation are obvious and can not be ignored by the world 's highest forum .  
Moreover , while the threat of a major international confrontation has receded with the end of the cold war , a host of other problems , including an upsurge in inter-State conflicts , international terrorism , growing poverty and marginalization of vast segments of humanity in the developing countries as well as within affluent societies , are coming to the fore .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
To this end , an institutional infrastructure was developed to promote economic and social development for our peoples through the establishment of a new international economic order , one that would generate more favourable conditions and opportunities for the developing countries to make progress , thus setting in motion a process of evening out the major imbalances between North and South . 
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
In addition , at a time when the North-South gap continues to widen on a daily basis , the world economic trend , manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries , also tends further to debilitate the potential of the developing countries to deal with the adverse impacts of international economic development .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
The content of the statements made at the highest level during the debate at the Special Commemorative Meeting and the Declaration adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations again demonstrated the need for the international community to give the economic and social development problems of developing countries the attention they deserve .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
It is equally important to realize that restructuring alone can not accomplish much in the area of socio-economic development without a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries , as called for in resolution 48 / 162 .  
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
They now face the challenging tasks of reviving and modernizing national institutions , designing and developing both the human and the physical infrastructures , and rebuilding the economy by revitalizing agriculture , industry and trade and social services all with extremely limited resources and formidable impediments . 
While some developing African countries and regions have undoubtedly benefited from the economic take-off of the last decade and applied positive structural adjustment policies , the results of Africa 's socio-economic development during this last period in particular in sub-Saharan Africa , where a large number of the least developed countries are concentrated have been universally acknowledged as disappointing .  
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
Given much-needed support to the developing countries as they reactivate their economies and creating a favourable external environment for them are not only important conditions for the shared economic growth and common prosperity of all countries , but also a crucial guarantee for lasting peace and stability throughout the world .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
The reciprocal commitment by developed and developing countries to allocate an average we would say a minimum of 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets , respectively , to basic social programmes has yet to be fulfilled .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
In pursuit of that objective we have contributed to the exchange of information and expertise in the various areas of development ; we have opened our markets to free international trade ; we have established the Abu Dhabi development fund to make concessional loans to developing countries ; and we have participated in the provision of assistance through regional and international bilateral and multilateral development institutions .  
The implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action will require mobilization of new and additional financial resources at the national and international levels , better and effective utilization of the existing resources , enhanced assistance from the developing countries and a substantial reduction in their debt burden .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
One of the most concrete outcomes of Copenhagen was the adoption on a voluntary basis of the 20 / 20 principle , which calls for interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
As members know , the working papers prepared by the Secretariat inform us that the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are developing successfully and thus moving towards self-determination only where there has been the active involvement of foreign economic entities through substantial foreign investment .  
The figures speak for themselves : some 1-billion people live below the subsistence level ; half of the world 's population may not have access to safe drinking water ; three quarters of the developing world do not have adequate sanitary facilities ; while at least 200-million people lack basic shelter .  
In the preambular paragraphs , the General Assembly would note with satisfaction that the programme has trained an appreciable number of public officials selected from all geographical regions represented in the United Nations system and also that many officials of developing countries have acquired expertise through the training programme .  
These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at providing the United Nations system , on a stand-by basis , with specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation , and , in this regard , notes with satisfaction the establishment , in particular in developing countries , of national volunteer corps ;  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
The potential contribution of improved efficiency in meeting growing needs for energy services in a sustainable way in the rural areas of developing countries can be substantial , especially at the point of end use , by introducing new , efficient , low-polluting technologies and systems and by upgrading existing , inefficient systems .  
Many representatives considered that it was essential to look into the special needs of developing countries and the extra funding needed for implementing measures if the critical areas of concern identified in the Platform for Action were to be addressed effectively .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
To identify and strengthen or develop , as required , in particular in developing countries , the appropriate institutional , legal and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policy and its implementation are a catalyst for sustainable social progress and economic growth .  
Governments , according to their capacities and available resources and with the cooperation of the United Nations and other relevant organizations , should promote centres of excellence for training in hazardous waste management , building on appropriate national institutions and encouraging international cooperation , inter alia , through institutional links between developed and developing countries .  
To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
This would encompass the preparation of national strategies and actions for meeting basic learning needs , universalizing access and promoting equity , broadening the means and scope of education , developing a supporting policy context , mobilizing resources and strengthening international cooperation to redress existing economic , social and gender disparities which interfere with these aims .  
National and local educational authorities and relevant United Nations agencies should expand , as appropriate , the use of audio-visual methods , especially in rural areas in mobile units , by producing television and radio programmes for developing countries , involving local participation , employing interactive multimedia methods and integrating advanced methods with folk media ;  
Furthermore , it had been decided that an executive session of the Board would be held at the earliest possible opportunity to address the modalities for dealing with the implications for trading opportunities of developing countries and countries in transition concerned of new and emerging issues on the international trade agenda . 
UNCTAD , when carrying out technical cooperation , should exploit its comparative advantages , ensure complementarity with the related work of other international organizations , intervene on strategic and catalytic grounds and allow for the differentiated needs of developing countries with a particular focus on the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , in accordance with the Cartegena Commitment .  
In August 1993 , IMF wrote to ministers of finance , central bank governors and heads of national statistical offices in a number of industrial and developing countries to seek their comments on the terms of reference of the Task Force ; on the role of international organizations in developing standards for finance statistics ; on current arrangements for data collection and sharing ; and on the findings of the questionnaire .  
The Task Force has reviewed current arrangements for the reporting and sharing of finance statistics by international organizations , and notes that there appears to be a considerable and probably increasing degree of data sharing of finance statistics among international organizations , especially through the use of electronic media , which have replaced the use of report forms in the industrial and major developing countries .  
The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
The procedure includes a series of visits by IMF staff to the main international organizations concerned and to official agencies in a number of selected industrial and developing countries , as well as the distribution of an annotated outline of the manual to all member countries for comment .  
An earlier report of the Secretary-General ( A / 45 / 274-E / 1990 / 73 and Corr . 1 ) , submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session through the Economic and Social Council , had stressed the need to adopt comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures in order to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , including new and renewable sources of energy .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
The debate on the issues raised within the Agenda for Peace evoked , and in fact continues to evoke , mixed reactions within and outside the United Nations , developing into a continuing debate as the issues raised deal with questions of international peace and security , with substantial focus on the United Nations peacekeeping activities .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
Priorities have to be assigned , using the Programme of Action as a guide , among potential topics - for example , certain aspects of human sexuality , sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS , preparation for family life , promoting the status of women , developing among girls a positive and future-oriented self-image , the dynamics and implications of rapid urbanization , male responsibility and so forth .  
A projection of collective and global resource requirements , presented by the organizations to their respective governing body , based on approved and planned programmes , taking into account the needs of developing countries , their absorptive capacity , the themes and programmes of action agreed at world conferences and other forums , and the ability of the organization to deliver the proposed programmes ;  
Either of these modalities , together with strong political support for operational activities , could provide a better system with more assured , predictable and increased levels of resources to meet the needs of developing countries .  
Welcoming the increased role undertaken by the United Nations system to support activities in economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and stressing the importance of continuing to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to foster international cooperation in order to address fully the wide range of issues pertaining to development and the growth of developing countries ,  
Many of those weapons are being bought , from developed countries , by developing countries that can least afford to dissipate their precious and finite assets for such purposes , and the volume of the trade in light weapons is far more alarming than the monetary cost might lead one to suspect . 
We are now in the process of developing permanent mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and collective security based on a regional commitment to a system of shared democratic values .  
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
Note : The words in brackets and in bold are pending ; a proposed alternative was to retain only the words " developing countries " and to insert a new sentence : " Radical political , social and economic changes in the countries with economies in transition have been accompanied by a severe deterioration of their economic and social situation . "  
Protecting the [ traditional ] rights to land and other resources of pastoralists , fishery workers and nomadic and indigenous people and strengthening land management in areas of pastoral or nomadic activity , building on traditional communal practices , controlling encroachment by others , and developing improved systems of range management and access to water , markets , credit , animal production , veterinary services , health including health services , education and information ;  
Expanding basic education by developing special measures to provide schooling to children and youth living in sparsely populated and remote areas , for children and youth of nomadic , pastoral , migrant or indigenous parents , and for street children , children and youth working or looking after younger siblings and disabled or aged parents , and disabled children and youth ; establishing , in partnership with indigenous people , educational systems that will meet the unique needs of their cultures ;  
Supporting academic and research institutions particularly in the developing countries , in their contribution to social development programmes , and to facilitate the mechanisms for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of social progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about economic and social development ;  
Implementation of the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of the small-island developing States , in particular by providing effective means including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for social development programmes in accordance with the Barbados Declaration and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Programmes of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Inviting the international community , including the international financial institutions , to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development without falling into a new debt crisis ;  
United Nations development efforts should be supported by a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as stated in resolution 47 / 199 ;  
According to the Human Development Report 1994 , Chile had ranked eighth out of 97 developing countries in 1992 in the human development index , which took into account such indicators as infant mortality , daily caloric intake , adult literacy and average number of years of schooling .  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
UNESCO is developing its own electronic network and information service on biosphere reserves and ecological sciences ( MABNet ) , as well as its own database on national and cultural world heritage sites .  29 .  WCMC continued to compile and update substantial databases on habitats and threatened animals and plants for the red data books and biodiversity status reports that it publishes .  
The support units seem widespread - they are responsible for developing local guidelines for national execution , training line ministries on national execution procedures , preparing the required national execution reports , facilitating contractual arrangements with cooperating and implementation agencies and generally providing support to the technical ministries hosting nationally executed programmes .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
Establish a group of eminent persons selected through a consultative process and balanced between developed and developing countries , as well as equitably representing all interest groups and the forest products trade , with a mandate to chart a path towards steady progress in international trade in forest products from all types of forests based on sustainably managed forests and the application of criteria and indicators to measure and monitor such management . 
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
Russia was prepared to seek mutually acceptable decisions with regard to security guarantees for the non-nuclear States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , which would create favourable conditions for the development of broad international cooperation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes , taking duly into account the needs of the developing countries .  
The Committee recommends that the State party strengthen the coordination between the different governmental mechanisms involved in human rights and children 's rights , at both the national and local levels , and ensure a closer cooperation with non-governmental organizations , with a view to developing a comprehensive policy on children and ensuring an effective evaluation of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the country .  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , and especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development ,  
Thus , it was stated that the establishment of an international criminal court , with the subsidiary organs mentioned in article 5 and other infrastructures , would entail an enormous financial outlay which might be an extra burden for developing countries .  
The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly the developing countries ,  
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
Stressing the importance of trade as a major instrument of economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries and the need to find solutions to microeconomic issues of international trade which can significantly contribute to more open , dynamic and efficient trade relations ,  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .  In some developing nations , especially in Africa , the situation was further aggravated by a decline in commodity prices .  
Recognizing the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , including , inter alia , developing basic infrastructural facilities , promoting social development , combating socio-economic disparities and poverty , preparing , as appropriate , conditions for the private sector and protecting the environment ,  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
In synthesis , the fifth country programme aims at developing , piloting and building within six local impact areas , capacities and systems for a participatory approach to development that will enable the poor to benefit from basic social services , resources and advice necessary for the enhancement of their productivity and improvement of their standard of living .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
The new forces of modern science and technology , if harnessed properly and applied in accordance with each country 's particular socio-economic and cultural circumstances , offer immense possibilities for solving many of the complicated problems that are currently impeding economic , social and environmentally sound and sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
A problem shared by developing and industrialized countries alike is that most current training programmes and institutional structures are sectoral and disciplinary and do not address the complex interactions among people , natural resources , technology , environment and development .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Recognizing the high costs of research in biotechnology , several existing agricultural research institutes have strengthened or initiated new biotechnology programmes to address the common elements of research and development as well as the training needs of developing countries in many areas outlined under programme area E , with support from financial institutions , foundations and , to a lesser extent , the private business sector .  
The economic returns resulting from those biotechnology applications that have been supported by venture capital have encouraged a steady increase in investment in biotechnology , yet the beneficial results of applications in developing countries and the benefits derived from such applications are not perceived to have extended much beyond the business community .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
By its decision 16 / 25 of 31 May 1991 , the Governing Council set the following long-term goals for the work of ELI / PAC : ( a ) a coherent body of international law in the environmental field ; ( b ) national environmental laws adopted and institutions established in developing countries ; and ( c ) an operational comprehensive database on national and international environmental law . 
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
Nevertheless , several countries state that in order to have a more sustainable impact , legal literacy should include developing an awareness of rights in general and of existing national statutory rights in particular , since penal and civil codes protect everyone .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
This was accompanied by a dramatic fourfold increase in developing countries and substantial increase in the former centrally planned economies ( by a factor of 2.4 ) .  7 / In per capita terms , the absolute consumption of fossil fuels in developed countries outstripped by a factor of 9 the consumption level in developing countries , as is evident in table 3 .  
Despite encouraging progress achieved over the past two decades in energy efficiency , especially in industrialized countries , global demand for commercial energy is projected to continue to grow in the coming years , with the main momentum coming from developing countries .  
Environmental monitoring data and other relevant information , including consumer information , which are currently lacking in many developing countries , need to be developed urgently so as to provide a sound information base for policy formulation and decision-making on changing the current unsustainable production and consumption patterns .  
In the rural areas , where they are predominantly located in most of the developing regions except Latin America , they are the landless or near-landless illiterate agricultural workers , nomads , fishermen , pastoralists and forest dwellers who eke out a subsistence income from seasonal agricultural employment or from marginal lands and forests or from low-income non-farm work .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
It is generally recognized that the capacity of agriculture to absorb the growing labour force on a long-term basis is limited in most of the developing countries with a high incidence of rural poverty by the sheer unavailability of additional arable land . 
The latter 's objective is to enable people with low incomes in the Appalachian region successfully to enter the economic mainstream by , inter alia , organizing cooperative ventures among small firms to produce for niche markets , mobilizing financial resources on behalf of the region from outside , creating learning clusters in conjunction with other communities in the country , providing transitional support for people moving from welfare to work , and developing production and leadership skills .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
According to the World Industry Council for the Environment ( WICE ) , 39 / inbound foreign capital only accounts for some 3-4 per cent of total domestic capital formation in developing countries , the vast majority coming from domestic savings .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
The United Nations needed to be more competitive in the international professional market and the current salary package fell particularly short in respect of nationals from both developed and developing countries who had other options for employment .  
The consensus 9 / adopted by the Conference views environmental degradation as having many causes , including irrational development patterns , inappropriate technologies and consumption patterns , mainly among industrialized countries and privileged minorities in developing countries , and worsening standards of living for vast sectors of the population .  
For clusters of indicators , various organizations will have the task of assuming a leading role in a transparent consultative process for the purpose of further developing the indicators , as relevant , including the underlying methodology , and of analysing the data availability for each indicator in order to provide a full description of each indicator in a set of methodology sheets .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
Despite the cyclical fall in contributions to multilateral institutions , developing countries ' receipts from this source were cushioned to some extent by the fact that the multilateral institutions , especially the international financial institutions , can draw on income from previous years to make their current disbursements .  
To support private pollution abatement investment , Governments in OECD countries , economies in transition and developing countries have used a wide range of policy instruments , which may be divided into three main categories : directed credit programmes , financial incentives , co-financing arrangements and venture capital funds .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
Many representatives considered that it was essential to look into the special needs of developing countries and the extra funding needed for implementing measures if the critical areas of concern identified in the Platform for Action were to be addressed effectively .  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
They note that an informal round table that includes representatives of all agencies , as well as members of the academic community and relevant non-governmental organizations , is useful for the purposes of developing innovative ideas and concepts relating to how development communication should be understood , as far as this concept has not yet been defined according to one universal standard .  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and that they are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  See E / CN . 17 / 1994 / CRP . 2 .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
The broad mandate outlined in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action has sometimes tended to be measured in terms of the number of experts from developing countries working on projects , the frequency of meetings to promote TCDC and the level of procurement from the developing countries , instead of being seen as a rational imperative for ensuring the full integration of TCDC into the wider conception of operational activities in support of the overall development process .  
In particular , the more economically advanced developing countries are in a position to transfer to other developing countries the skills and experience , including new and innovative techniques of industrial organization and production and the creative application of technology , that have proved so successful in increasing the productivity and competitiveness of their own economies .  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Although progress towards universal education and literacy has been impressive in recent times , the number of illiterate people will continue to grow and many developing countries are likely to fall short of universal primary education by the year 2000 .  Three main concerns regarding current systems of education may be expressed .  
Efforts should be made to remove those unreasonable restrictions on transfer of nuclear energy technology so as to help the developing countries master the technology for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to create favourable conditions for the establishment of a new international cooperative relationship in the field of nuclear energy .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In response , the Special Unit has prepared a report which contains a number of recommendations designed to promote and implement a more strategic approach to technical cooperation among developing countries in an effort to make it a dynamic instrument in support of development in the context of the changing realities of multilateral development cooperation .  
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
As Chief of the Section the incumbent would be responsible for developing comprehensive country-based and regional humanitarian strategies , ensuring proper measures are taken for effective coordination of all aspects of humanitarian assistance programmes in those regions , including support on the ground , fund-raising initiatives and consolidated inter-agency appeals .  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
A second programme : " Applications of biotechnology for development " is presently a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life . 
The additional post of Economic Affairs Officer requested will be the focal point essential to mobilize the existing expertise and research capabilities required to guide developing countries and least developed countries and strengthen their understanding of these matters and the competitiveness of their enterprises in increasingly globalized world markets and marketing requirements .  
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
The increase of $ 31,600 is required for the broader scope of information to be covered , such as new market potentials for products from developing countries , emerging new trading areas in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim , environmental aspects of international trade , women in development ; increased prices and shipping costs and the high prices of machine-readable data increasingly replacing traditional publications on the information market .  ( a ) Services in support of :  
Within the framework of existing guidelines , individual technical cooperation activities under the regular programme are determined by the nature of requests received from developing countries , the recommendations of intergovernmental legislative and expert bodies , and the approved work programmes .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
The programme comprises four interrelated and mutually supportive functions : ( a ) developing statistical concepts and methods for use by Member States ; ( b ) collecting , processing and disseminating integrated statistics ; ( c ) promoting the coordination of international statistical activities ; and ( d ) supporting technical cooperation in statistics and statistical data processing , including informatics .  
The activities to be carried out in the biennium 1996-1997 under the three subprogrammes of programme 12 of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised ( A / 47 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , will emphasize assistance to developing countries in improving their development planning systems and policies in support of national development through provision of advisory services to Governments upon their request and substantive and operational support to technical cooperation projects .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
An innovative programme has been designed to assist indigenous peoples in developing their own strategies , based on traditional knowledge , for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and habitat preservation while yielding economic benefits for the support of local populations .  
Initially created to foster the economic empowerment of women in the developing world by improving their access to credit , productive resources , training and opportunities for income - generation , the Fund 's scope of work over the last two decades has expanded to include the promotion of women 's social and political empowerment .  
The Commission noted the importance of developing , among the organizations of the United Nations system , a common or compatible system of access to their respective databases , in order to share data fully , to streamline the collection and interpretation of data and to identify data gaps , for the purpose of providing more comprehensive and integrated data to decision makers at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Russian Federation remains faithful to the principles of equitable international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and providing assistance to developing countries and regions of the world in satisfying their wishes on the basis of non-discrimination , if they are legitimate and do not run counter to the Treaty .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The transfer of environmentally sound technology , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 , in accordance with chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , is highlighted by the Commission as having a particularly important role to play in realizing the goals of sustainable development .  
The Commission recognizes that in pursuing studies on economic instruments , innovative mechanisms and the " matrix approach " , full consideration should be given to the concerns of developing countries stated above , including the mobilization of resource flows , and to promoting national capacities and capabilities , taking into account the social , economic and distributional impacts of policy options and keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The Commission emphasizes that strengthened international cooperation in harmonizing criteria for the setting of voluntary product standards , with due regard to the specific environmental , social and economic conditions in developing producer / exporting countries , should take into account concerns about market access and the competitiveness of products and services .  
For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
The main areas of focus involve debt and resource flows ; commodities and diversification ; structural adjustment programmes and policy reforms ; sustained and sustainable development ; population ; environment and development ; regional cooperation and integration ; export performance ; and problems of the least developed , land-locked and island developing countries , as well as related technical cooperation activities .  External relations .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
Such an attempt would be at least partly speculative , but the attempt would be incomplete if it ignored some of the key factors that are bound to influence future international economic relations and , inevitably , the economic well-being of the peoples of developing countries .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
A coherent national policy would enhance the managerial capability on economic and technical cooperation among developing countries within government and could enable developing countries to take maximum advantage of their participation in cooperation activities and speed up the implementation of relevant decisions and programmes .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
It also suggests an approach that consists of a careful selection of specific activities within the sector , followed by interactions among developing countries on the conceptual plane in the first instance , moving on to detailed technical work involving programme / project preparation , analysis and implementation .  
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
Examination and recommendation to developing countries on a continuing basis , in the light of changing circumstances and emerging conditions of specific areas and capacities relating to economic cooperation among developing countries and to technical cooperation among developing countries for absorbing lessons from the success of other developing countries .  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
The national committees for the Decade and related technical agencies of the industrialized countries have remained active in the respective countries and have pursued a variety of collaborative relationships with neighbouring countries , and supported disaster-reduction initiatives in developing countries .  
The objective of the Decade remains , as originally stated , " to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters " .  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
The wealth of knowledge of social and economic priorities and expanded networks of relationships with politicians and technicians in the respective regions offer an impressive potential for leadership in the United Nations system , as well as for developing networks and partnerships for selecting development priorities and designing programmes and projects .  
While welcoming the decision of JCGP to set a target date for this exercise , the General Assembly in resolution 47 / 199 emphasized that that process should be achieved in cooperation with host Governments in a way that increased efficiency , such as by means of the consolidation of administrative infrastructures of the organizations concerned , and with no financial increase in the cost of operations either to the United Nations system or the host developing country .  
Several delegations considered that UNEP 's regional offices could play a useful role in helping developing countries to strengthen their capacity to implement Agenda 21 .  5 / Some delegations stressed that the role of UNEP in providing information on sustainable development should be concentrated on environmental aspects of such development and that such information should be prepared upon the request of Governments .  
In many developing countries there is an apparent lack of a " critical mass " of qualified managers , technicians , and skilled workers needed to support basic levels of public sector activity .  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
UNDP had encouraged resident coordinators to strengthen and establish thematic working groups on HIV and AIDS and to ensure their effective functioning ; invited JCP / UNAIDS and its co-sponsors to attend UNDP training workshops ; participated actively in global - and regional-level activities to develop a strategic plan of action for JCP / UNAIDS ; and was working with staff of JCP / UNAIDS responsible for developing the programme 's approach at country level .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
Secondly , the Indian Administrative Service ( IAS ) has established a professional corps of educated public administrators who share a common background of professional training , accept a common set of responsibilities towards developing the capacities of the citizenry in their jurisdictions , and represent a strong presence of the national Government in state and local jurisdictions .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
International economic , trade and development cooperation : As the world 's fourteenth largest trading nation and the sixth largest outbound investor , the Republic of China on Taiwan is willing to share its own development experience and achievements with the international community and has already offered to developing countries financial and technical assistance for development projects .  
In developing the standards in appendix II , five principles were followed : ( a ) performance statements were made functional and not equipment-specific ; ( b ) fairness was achieved by establishing a high but equitable level of performance ; ( c ) a firm baseline for a minimum acceptable level of performance was set ; ( d ) the standards must themselves be verifiable in the mission area ; and ( e ) the standards must be at a level and expressed in terms that are acceptable to all Member States .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
The main development objectives of UNDP 's third country programme for Tokelau ( 1992-1996 ) focused primarily on developing a national identity and assumption of a greater degree of self-government ; improvement of living standards on the atolls ; ensuring the equitable distribution of resources ; and encouraging the active participation of the people in the development policy process .  
One delegation offered three principles to expand net income from the private sector in developing countries : the income generated should be additional to the general resources country programme allocation ; the strategic importance of the decentralized operations of the regional support centres in Rio de Janeiro and Singapore should be maintained ; and there should continue to be investments from FDP .  
The Director of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , UNDP , said that in the light of the processes of globalization and economic liberalization , the intensification of South-South cooperation has become a major imperative both as a development strategy and as a means for ensuring the effective and equitable integration of the developing countries in the new global order .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
In the meantime , in order to address the urgent problems facing the repatriation of refugees , it may be useful to convene , at the earliest possible date , a regional meeting aimed at developing concrete measures to implement the commitments embodied in the Nairobi Summit declaration of January 1995 , the Bujumbura Action Plan of February 1995 and the tripartite agreements signed by UNHCR , Rwanda and neighbouring countries hosting Rwandan refugees .  
The Director of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , UNDP , said that in the light of the processes of globalization and economic liberalization , the intensification of South-South cooperation has become a major imperative both as a development strategy and as a means for ensuring the effective and equitable integration of the developing countries in the new global order .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
Encourage national implementation of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management and study the feasibility of further developing internationally agreed upon criteria and indicators against which progress towards sustainable forest management of all types of forests could be measured , taking into account the specific regional and subregional conditions of forests and the diversity of economic , social and cultural environments .  
Thus , the data and information management component of the Division of Environment Assessment is operating a computerized catalogue ( " meta-database " ) on environmental data and information , developing critical datasets for assessments and assisting and supporting national Governments , regional data networks and other programmes in their efforts to improve access to and management of relevant and meaningful data and information on the environment .  
The Consultative Committee also published the outcome and proceedings of the special meeting on developing legal and institutional guidelines for privatization and post-privatization regulatory framework , held at Tokyo in January 1994 , which included the draft text of such guidelines .  
The meeting reviewed the global observances of the Year and their implications for national social policies in the process of sustainable development ; considered concepts and forms of international cooperation on family issues , with particular emphasis on assistance to developing countries ; and identified strategies and recommendations regarding national , regional and international follow-up to the Year .  
We are fully cognizant of the fact that the shared historical and cultural heritage of the States , countries and territories of our Association provides a solid basis for developing our efforts at cooperation and concerted action , particularly in the areas of tourism , trade and transportation , as well as for enriching our future to the benefit of all our peoples ;  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
FAO regards South-South cooperation as a key element in the developing countries ' search for collective self-reliance and an essential contribution to the necessary structural changes required for a balanced and equitable process of world economic development .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
Most ECDC / TCDC promotional and supportive programmes / activities involve twinning of industrial research institutions ; identification and strengthening of centres of excellence in developing countries to provide industrial training and expert advice ; promotion of joint research and development programmes and linking of chambers of commerce and industry , industrial associations and other relevant institutions in various developing countries .  
It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
Also , in this regard , following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ( April 1994 ) , which included agriculture for the first time in a substantive fashion , there has been a growing interest by developing countries in coming to grips with the changed international trading environment for agriculture and FAO has been developing a programme to respond to this need .  
The work deals with comparative experiences in the privatization of water supply , focusing on private sector participation in urban water utility operations in industrialized , developing and transitional countries , an important area of intergovernmental policy discussions , including those relevant to Habitat II .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .  
Capital has become more mobile than ever across the world , owing to a combination of policies that encourage foreign investment in many developing economies with the rapid advance in computer-based telecommunication technology ; and the growth in the size of institutional investors ( mutual funds , pension funds , and so on ) .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
Models of international trade and the experience of fast-growing developing countries also imply that in order for the transition economies of central and eastern Europe to achieve long-term growth rates significantly higher than those of the developed economies , which by now have become their major trading partners , continuous and rapid improvement will be needed in their exports . 
There is much potential for further sweeping changes and geographical shifts in the loci of production , as the developing countries adapt to technological advances , especially large countries with a latent export potential , and as the economies in transition begin to expand , especially those situated in proximity to major world markets .  
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Strengthening national capacities in developing countries to implement the Platform for Action will require striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , as well as increasing the share of funding for activities designed to implement the Platform for Action .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes should take into account a gender perspective .  
With the increased importance of NGOs in the United Nations system , this constituency and the scholarly community have a major role to play in channelling relevant information and research results , developing teaching materials , engaging in advocacy and sponsoring fruitful technical assistance activities , as the correctional training initiatives have recently demonstrated .  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
The Panel stressed that all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings and expert consultations in support of the work of the Panel should ensure the transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives as well as a balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
One of the major objectives of international cooperation must be to create greater harmonization in criminal justice systems , by improving the standards of countries with weaker criminal justice systems in general or by developing national legislation specifically directed against organized crime .  
In most developing countries and countries in transition , however , various factors , ranging from lack of adequate resources to recent rapid political and economic developments and changes , have slowed down or inhibited the process of attaining a thorough understanding of the situation .  
The accumulation of theoretical knowledge has irreplaceable value for the purposes of educating younger generations and the public in general and for devising strategies and developing measures to counter the corrupting effects of organized crime on societal values .  
In the absence of specialized theoretical and practical knowledge , and in view of the difficulties faced in obtaining such knowledge , as well as the results of the experience accumulated in other countries , the elaboration of strategies and their implementation through legislative and regulatory measures are daunting tasks for many countries , particularly developing countries and those with economies in transition .  
The Government of Cuba stressed that despite the end of the cold war , certain Powers , based on their predominant position in the world economy , have continued to use coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
The Government of Cuba is concerned that , despite relevant resolutions adopted in recent years by the General Assembly on the use of coercive economic measures against developing countries , which provide a clear mandate , the United Nations Secretariat has still not identified specific activities within the medium-term plan and programme budget for the proper implementation of those decisions .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has consistently rejected any unilateral promulgation and application of laws such as those referred to in resolution 49 / 9 because such measures are inconsistent with the general principles of international law and violate the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular paragraph 2 on developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Furthermore , with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , a national transport policy framework has been drafted , which aims at developing a coordinated transport system , in a market-oriented approach , and a sound base for the various carriers to provide reliable , efficient and economic services to the people .  
It is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .

NULLIt is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .  
NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
NULLAlthough the case of Mexico had several unique features , once the crisis began international securities investors suddenly reassessed their risks in all the emerging market economies : the contagious effect of the Mexican crisis left no developing country untouched in the short term . 
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
Most recently , on the heels of the Mexican payments crisis and the contagion factor described above ( see paras . 40-43 ) , the Governments of the major creditor countries have sought to bolster international confidence in developing economies through a strengthened early-warning system based on enhanced surveillance of economic policies .  
Developed country representatives underlined their support for the process through contributions to the two funds : they are both considered important , since it is essential that the high quality of Secretariat work be maintained ; and necessary that developing countries , in particular least developed countries , be well represented at forthcoming sessions of the Committee .  
Issues addressed here are closely related to those being considered by the General Assembly at its current session with respect to international cooperation in the eradication of poverty in developing countries , the International Year for Poverty Eradication , the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development , the coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences and the comprehensive policy review of operational activities .  
NULLWhile it is true that a high rate of investment is not by itself sufficient to bring about sustained development , no developing country has achieved sustainable , vigorous economic development with low rates of investment .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
NULLIn the light of those findings , the Working Group , in its general conclusions , confirmed that efforts towards promoting technology transfer and technological capability-building in developing countries and countries in transition need to be coupled with market-based trade and investment policy and pricing systems , and with a stable macroeconomic environment for business activity conducive to overall economic growth and employment . 
Priorities included : ( a ) regaining access to civilian populations in areas controlled by factions ; ( b ) preparing a new appeal for humanitarian assistance requirements ; ( c ) meeting the emergency needs of newly displaced populations ; and ( d ) developing a cohesive and shared strategy to meet the needs of the greatest possible number of affected civilians .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
NULLThe Panel recommended to all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings or expert consultations relevant to the work of the Panel to ensure the open-ended , transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives and the balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
" In addition to international developments related to the elaboration of the 1982 Convention , FAO continued to stress , in fisheries policy and technical advice provided to its developing members , that the implementation of conservation and management measures in exclusive economic zones would be unlikely to bring sustained long-term benefits in the absence of sound , reliable and cost-effective MCS systems . 
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
The event could also include an exposition of traditional and improved farmers ' instruments , artisanal products of rural communities from various parts of the developing world , a photo exhibit , stands for publications , a video show and a musical programme , while the African and international media would cover the event through national and satellite television networks .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
NULLThe budget of UNDCP has two separate and complementary parts : the regular budget concerned with treaty implementation and legal affairs ; and the Fund budget supported by voluntary contributions and geared to assist developing countries in drug control .  
In practical terms , the campaign against racism and xenophobia must be carried out by developing educational programmes , punishing those responsible for such practices , opening up new opportunities for members of racial and ethnic minorities and ensuring , at all levels , respect for human dignity .  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
Promotes regional and subregional cooperation on modalities for addressing critical issues faced by disadvantaged groups in societies undergoing rapid change , with particular consideration to technical cooperation among developing countries through the organization of national and subregional training workshops and field study-cum-seminar programmes ;  
It assists in increasing the statistical capacity of developing countries in their efforts by improving the quality of demographic , social , economic and other statistics in a form suitable for retrieval and dissemination .  
Even in normal times , particularly in developing countries , the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes , and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution , water supplies , health-care services , waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world .  
During 1995 , the UNICEF Regional Office continued to work with the secretariat in developing analytical materials on major issues affecting southern African children , including human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and is exploring possible collaboration with the human resource development sector in the area of basic education .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
Among the 15 requirements to achieve this objective is agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ( ibid . , para . 88 ( c ) ) .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
The legitimate world-wide concern for social development and environmental protection should not be allowed to degenerate into additional conditionalities imposed on developing countries from abroad .  
In order to secure global peace and prosperity , it was essential to close the widening gap between the developed and developing countries and to ensure that development was equitable and sustainable .  
Not only were developing countries affected , given the unfavourable economic international climate , but also industrialized countries , where immigrant communities were increasingly the target of xenophobic , racist and intolerant acts .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
There is clearly an inadequate level of implementation of existing conventions and of international rules , regulations and standards , as reflected in the insufficient adaptation of national legislation and procedures , the inefficiency of enforcement and the increasing gap between developed and developing countries in their capacity for implementation .  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
In parallel , UNIDO is preparing a manual for self-diagnosis of critical technological needs for sustained competitiveness at the plant level , the core of which could be applied to all developing countries .  
Of particular significance among these are the facilitation of technical and financial support for developing country parties , as required by the Convention and called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 195 , as well as the role played by the secretariat in coordinating the in-depth reviews of the national communications received from annex I parties .  
64 A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national , social and economic development programmes .  
Emphasizes the need to broaden appropriate cooperation among monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to encourage the establishment of preventive consultations between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Reaffirming its resolution 48 / 165 of 21 December 1993 on the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership and 48 / 166 of 21 December 1993 on an agenda for development , Reaffirming also the urgent need for a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is required to contribute to a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also with concern the urgent need to fully address the problem of the combined external debt stock of developing countries , bearing in mind the special and critical situation of the most indebted developing countries in Africa and the least developed countries ,  
Expressing its concern that , despite the determined efforts undertaken by developing countries in terms of implementing continuous economic reforms and structural adjustments , the burden of debt and debt service of these countries continues to be a major obstacle to their sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Recognizes that a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries will have a substantial impact on sustaining the strength of the global economy and will greatly contribute to efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
In that regard , the meeting focused primarily on policy and management issues involved in national , regional and international space programmes , and on how those issues related to the exploitation of space technology for sustainable development , taking into account the social and economic conditions of the developing countries concerned .  
6 Presentations delivered during the Symposium addressed the issue of how satellite remote sensing and satellite communications could provide accurate and timely information considered to be essential for policy formulation and effective decision-making in developing countries .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
integral part of international cooperation on concrete issues in the economic , environmental and social fields to support plans and priorities of developing countries in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community to promote a supportive international economic environment by adopting favourable macroeconomic policies for promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development , so as to allow and sustain the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action by the developing countries ;  
The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .  
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
The representative of the United States of America said that at the Conferences held at Rio de Janeiro , Vienna , Cairo , Copenhagen and Beijing , Member States had been developing a blueprint for economic , social and environmental action that recognized the important linkages among the various issues considered .  
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
Its members were all developing countries ; the mandates of its legislative bodies called for the promotion of economic , social and cultural cooperation among Member States ; and its subsidiary organs , agencies , affiliated institutions and international universities were geared towards the sharing of capacities and strengthening of cooperation in different spheres of socio-economic activity .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
The Committee 's deliberations therefore had to take account of the fact that the Organization 's political mandate needed to be coupled with effective funding based on realistic considerations rather than short-term assessments that would further weaken emerging democracies or the struggling economies of developing countries .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
stressed the need for strengthened international cooperation which should be reflected in appropriate financial and technological resources to enable developing countries to implement their national plans .  
Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on the urban transport , communications and energy sectors , and particular attention should be devoted to environmental policies and programmes in the developing countries with a view to improving and developing sustainable transport and communications systems , bearing in mind the respective social , economic and environmental requirements of those countries .  
tendency to impose unrealistic standards and requirements on the industries and products of developing countries and to propose or adopt financial policies which were detrimental to those countries ' economic and social development , under the pretext of environmental protection , was therefore inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of environmental agreements , including the Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
While stressing the crucial importance of controlling greenhouse gases , he noted that setting reduction objectives without taking into account the possible negative economic impact on developing countries to which the Convention gave special attention could not be regarded as a comprehensive approach for the implementation of the Convention .  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
The report on international cooperation for the eradication of poverty in developing countries ( A / 50 / 396 ) was valuable overall and responded generally to resolution 48 / 184 of 21 December 1993 ; however it lacked details on specific actions undertaken by United Nations bodies with respect to the role and needs of women living in poverty or the actions taken to improve social services in deprived urban areas .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;

most disadvantaged developing countries were the most seriously affected by the reduced United Nations programmes in particular , where net flows of official development assistance had decreased ; those of sub-Saharan Africa received only an insignificant proportion of direct foreign investment devoted to developing countries and were suffering a continued decline in exports . 
emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing countries ,  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular , the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes with a time-frame for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit-transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 27 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Also invites the international community to make substantial contributions to the special trust fund established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in order to facilitate the preparations for and holding of the World Food Summit as well as to facilitate the full and effective participation of representatives of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , both at the preparatory meetings for the Summit to be held in January and September 1996 and at the Summit itself ;  
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Over the years , UNCTAD has become the main forum for North-South debates , and played a crucial role in the establishment of the generalized system of preferences ( GSP ) , a maritime shipping code , and in setting international aid targets to help developing countries , particulary the least developed among them .  
addition , being aware of the need for concerted efforts on the part of all States , Belarus was actively developing its bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the fight against crime and had already signed , or was preparing to sign , agreements on the subject with various countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and others in Eastern and Western Europe .  
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
overwhelming majority of the world 's population lived in developing countries and for them , while political and civil rights were important , economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to subsistence and development , were paramount .  
was not mere rhetorical emphasis to say that the developing countries - regardless of their good will and sense of responsibility - faced a difficult choice between paying their debts to the Organization or attending to their own basic needs .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
Ever since its independence , Algeria 's principal aim has been the establishment of the institutions that make up a solid State , a State that endures beyond the realm of events and individuals , a State that has been given the weighty task of laying the groundwork for an economic and social machinery geared towards recovering and fully developing the nation 's wealth so as to meet the needs of its people .  
The imperatives of reducing budget deficits and the desire to achieve operational efficiency shared by us all could not possibly be the basis for a universal conclusion favouring the diminishment of the State or the systematic dismantling of public administration at the cost of inviting the disruption of networks that provide structure and sustenance to economic and social life in many developing countries .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
On the question of the funding of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , of particular importance to developing countries is , first , the new appeal for a substantial increase in resources for these activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and for intensified efforts to mobilize the political will to achieve this .  
The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
Honduras , like all other developing countries , is deeply committed to processes designed to combat poverty and underdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of its peoples and resources in order to attain speedy , fair and sustained growth , working jointly to enhance the effect of national efforts through solidarity , cooperation and mutual confidence .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
In this context , the Sultanate of Oman , as a developing country , has been looking forward to receiving the global support and assistance which , under the generalized system of preferences , the international community extends to developing countries to help them address the challenges posed by economic reforms and structural adjustment .  
The international community , which is still plagued by persistent violence , organized crime , drugs and terrorism , must translate these recommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable economic and social development and the free flow of trade between the developed and the developing countries .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
Allocating of resources to support the development of developing countries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and multilateral international cooperation for development are wise investments for peace and for the shared future of all of our societies .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
Aware that they are primarily responsible for promoting their own development through sound and consistent economic and social policies , the developing countries involved in structural adjustment programmes have made enormous sacrifices , which , unfortunately , have not yet achieved the desired results .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
They should , inter alia , pave the way for the active and global participation of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , in the work and procedures of the United Nations , including the Economic and Social Council , bearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these countries in the economic and social challenges facing today 's world .  
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
My country calls on the international community to ensure an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the new international trading system .  
We wish to stress the urgent need for the international community , particularly donor countries and international financial institutions , to adopt an effective , comprehensive and equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the debt problem of developing countries .  
If the developed countries are demanding protection for their sensitive domestic industries , then similar demands by developing countries with respect to their domestic industry should not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or inconsistent with current international trends .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
Thus , we are in no way , and to no degree , inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound reflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing States particularly those in the Caribbean region , where prominent among the features characterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present vulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread devastation resulting therefrom .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
We are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints faced by various developed countries , clarification of foreign aid objectives , revised conditions governing the granting of assistance , and the heightened competition among various regions for aid packages constitute a serious challenge for developing countries such as mine .  
The world was presented with a shocking and unfamiliar picture of my country , erasing the efforts of the national community to turn its back on its past and wiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devote themselves , within the framework of their sovereign choice , to the search for the means of developing the Central African Republic , with its vast potential in mining , agriculture and livestock and with its abundant rainfall .  
The Agenda for Development will be of no practical value to the developing countries if it limits itself to an analysis of the world economic outlook while failing to put forward specific action-oriented measures for implementation in an integrated and coordinated manner .  
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 161 reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Only when the international economic situation is conducive to development and international cooperation for development strengthened will the developing countries be in a realistic position to achieve any meaningful and lasting progress .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
I am pleased to say that , through decisive action rather than words , we have made genuine strides in enlarging our dialogue and cooperation with friendly nations worldwide , developed and developing alike .  
Brazil is one of the world 's largest democracies , a dynamic and diversified developing economy , an attractive opportunity for productive foreign investment and a market of huge potential in a word , a country capable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
There are still many who need to be convinced that nuclear technology is the inevitable option for satisfying the energy needs of developing countries and that it is worthwhile supporting nuclear-technology based programmes and activities also in the fields of fresh water , food , health and the environment .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
The Italian proposal addresses and reconciles the two major changes that have occurred on the international scene since the end of the Second World War : first , the emergence of a group of countries with considerable economic and political capacities , including Italy , which by 1 January 1998 will be the fifth largest contributor to the United Nations budget ; and secondly , the emergence of the developing countries , which are far more numerous and important today than they were in 1965 , when the Security Council was enlarged .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
I therefore wish to express Colombia 's support for the draft resolution before us , based on our commitment to the principle of respect for international law and to help promote freer , more vigorous and more transparent international trade allowing developing countries to strive for economic and social development .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
The Assembly has adopted a number of resolutions that have reflected its grave concern over the harmful effects suffered by the economies of developing countries and their developmental efforts as a result of these coercive economic measures , and over the negative effects of these measures on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to establish an open non-discriminatory trade system .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
At their annual meetings in 1996 , foreign ministers both of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77 called for the immediate elimination of all forms of coercive economic measures with negative , extraterritorial impact on the development of developing countries and which undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law and the free flow of trade and investment .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
The transformation of the international economy and accelerated trends towards globalization have , to be sure , resulted in new , more complex relations , but have also , due to certain harmful side effects , aggravated the imbalances and the dependency of many developing countries , whose courageous economic reforms , achieved at the highest of costs , still confront a hostile environment .  
In this new era of heightened interdependence , a lack of solidarity still characterizes international relations , and self-interest is persistent in terms of both security and development , emphasizing the lack of a mechanism that can effectively narrow the growing gap between developed countries ever more prosperous and stable and a developing world faced with poverty and disorder of every sort .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
While welcoming the Secretary-General designate , the Asian countries would like to pay tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , for his valuable contribution in guiding the work of the United Nations in the pursuit of its noble aims , finding just solutions to disputes , developing international cooperation in various fields , proposing the concepts of preventive diplomacy and post-conflict peace-building , and for his evolutionary vision of development , which have been duly reflected in the Secretary-General 's reports on an Agenda for Peace and on an Agenda for Development .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation . 
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development [ 7 ] / it is pointed out that although the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community ,  
Decides that the basic problem of improving the capacity of developing countries and economies in transition to capture the maximum sustainable economic and social benefits of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session , and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a discussion paper on this topic , with the assistance of members of the Committee .  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
Provide assistance to and involve in the implementation of the programme partners in related fields who have developed or are developing skills related to communication , local enterprises whose practical knowledge and technique on communication have been tested and confirmed , and training and research establishments that constitute regional or national centres of excellence .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
Thus , aware of the delicate situation in this regard faced by the Republic of Georgia , we wish to express our firm support for the activities of the Special Envoy and his resident Deputy , and for the initiatives of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mr . Ayala Lasso , as well as for the cooperation in this regard of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which is developing a programme specifically to deal with these urgent tasks .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
As industrialization proceeds in the dynamic developing economies and middle-income developing countries , rising standards of living and rapid urbanization will contribute to strong growth in electricity demand and petroleum consumption will rise from an increase in private motor transport .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
Electricity has increasingly assumed greater importance in the total energy mix of developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as being central to economic and social development .  
Energy is a critical factor in sustainable economic and social progress and development and , this being the case , developing countries are concerned about having secure and affordable sources of energy .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
The Council acknowledged the need to facilitate access for developing countries to energy-efficient technologies and research , and called upon the international community , including developed countries , to make technologies and financial resources available to the developing countries to enable them to fully develop their potential capability in the field of new and renewable sources of energy , including their vast hydropower resources .  
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
Other recommendations included the need to identify pivotal countries to serve as catalysts for promoting and implementing TCDC , the promotion of triangular cooperation arrangements under which donors agreed to fund exchanges among developing countries , the identification of subject-specific TCDC products , the expansion of TCDC-INRES into a multidimensional database , including information on several relevant centres of excellence , expert services and project experiences , as well as supporting the already existing institutional capacities in the developing countries .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the tenth session , as approved at the ninth session , taking fully into account the results of the ninth session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
One important achievement in 1995 was the continued operation within a relatively modest budget of a space network ( comprising telecommunications and television , the Mir manned orbital station , space research and technological development , navigational safety , tracking of vessels in distress , topographic geodesy and cartography , and remote sensing of the Earth ) designed for the purpose of implementing the Russian national space programme and aimed at achieving greater economic stability , further developing science and technology , improving the country 's security and intensifying its international cooperation activities .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
Recognizing that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Commending continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies . 
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
His delegation rejected the draft resolution , particularly the provisions concerning the deployment of human rights monitors throughout Iraqi territory , since those provisions violated the principles of national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States and might set an alarming precedent for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .

Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
Due to tight budgets in developed countries , developing countries and economies in transition , policy makers are showing increasing interest in saving on scarce budgetary resources by launching reviews of existing subsidy regimes .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
A wide variety of product and material taxes have been employed in OECD and developing countries to encourage more efficient use ( e.g . , pesticide taxes in Indonesia , fertilizer taxes in Scandinavia ) , to discourage / phase out certain substances ( e.g . , taxes on PVC and CFCs ) or to discourage the use of disposable products ( e.g . , plastic and paper tableware in Denmark , throwaway razors in the Netherlands ) .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and in this context , the proposal of the Government of Norway to host a meeting in 1996 among interested countries and representatives of relevant international institutions , with a view to considering how the 20 / 20 initiative can be applied operationally , is welcomed ;  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects , benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , viz . , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
From 1980 emphasis has been placed on the role of the public sector in promoting the economic development of developing countries , with auxiliary activities concentrating on the role of qualified national personnel in the social and economic development of developing countries , and specialized topics such as the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade , the development of human resources , or United Nations programmes of action for African economic recovery and development .  
For the past 45 years , pursuant to its various legislative mandates , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
Current assessment of most developing and transitional economies demonstrates that national Governments may need international support and cooperation in improving their public administration systems and training their personnel for initiating and implementing dynamic social programmes .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
Noting the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , concerning the problem of internal displacement ,  
Concerning the definition of an aerospace object , while we agree generally with question 1 , which considers the twofold capacity to travel and to fly into orbit as a specific characteristic of the aerospace object , we nevertheless admit that this interpretation is closely linked with the developing technology , and therefore we advise , in view of a possible legal definition consistent with the technological evolution , to thoroughly examine the aerospace object requisites . 
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
ITU had been instrumental in the establishment of the World Telecommunication Organization ( WorldTel ) , a cooperative body financed by private investors from industrialized countries which assisted developing countries in providing access to telecommunication facilities for a large segment of their population through the introduction of cost-effective technologies and the creation of a liberal economic environment .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
The General Assembly in resolution 50 / 146 , paragraph 9 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly UNDP Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Furthermore , the General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services , stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , and expressed its appreciation for the provision of the services of two interregional advisers .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
It emphasized that the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility for developing and developed countries , as outlined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , should be applied in any development of measures to protect the atmosphere on a global scale .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
The greatest relative potential for improving efficiency exists in the developing countries , followed by the transitional economies , because of the prevalence of traditional economic patterns and inefficient energy end-use technologies in those areas .  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
In developing demand management policy , a water agency must choose among combinations of numerous legislative , regulatory , technological and behavioral measures , each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages .  
Both sides believe that it is necessary for the United Nations to formulate an Agenda for Development based on General Assembly resolutions and hope that the conclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development will help the international community achieve the objective of sustainable development , contribute to the economic growth and social development of the developing countries and promote international cooperation and global development .  
ACC members shared the position expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , cited in paragraph 1 above . a / The General Assembly in paragraph 42 of resolution 47 / 199 , recognized the cost factor and indicated that common premises and the consolidation of administrative infrastructures should be achieved without increasing the costs for the United Nations system or for developing countries .  
The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development it is pointed out that while the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , and particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community , 
Decides that the basic problem of improving the capacity of developing countries and economies in transition to capture the economic and social benefits of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session , and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a discussion paper on this topic , with the assistance of members of the Committee .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .  NULLOrganizational approach to developing a multiple agency ,  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
Interested developed and developing country partners should reflect their mutual commitment by allocating , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance , including contributions through multilateral organizations and non-governmental organizations and 20 per cent of the national budgets ( net of aid ) , respectively , to basic social services , as soon as possible and preferably by the year 2000 .  
The meeting invited interested developing countries and donor Governments and multilateral organizations to review policy frameworks , plans of action and basic social services programmes , with identified national and external financing requirements , in all appropriate forums , in particular consultative group and round-table meetings .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in developing the necessary capabilities to enable public administration to implement the commitments agreed upon at major United Nations conferences in an effective and coordinated manner , ensuring the maintenance of essential basic government services and functions during times of crisis and developing strategies for rebuilding a viable public administration in countries undergoing post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
In its decision 96 / 15 , entitled " Allocation of resources to country programmes of the United Nations Population Fund " , the Executive Board reaffirmed that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there was a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
As is strongly reaffirmed in paragraph 5 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 , the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 50 / 120 .  
Also , while trying to reconstruct their economy and lay the foundations for their future State , the Palestinians were aware of the need for eventual integration into a larger economic context and developing mutually beneficial ties with countries of the Middle East , North Africa and the Mediterranean basin .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
The importance of closer cooperation is recognized by all Governments , although some developing countries - while encouraging this development - are concerned that it might lead to new conditionalities and make operational activities within the United Nations system subject to the restrictive policies normally attached to loans .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
From 1973 to 1992 , the total official development assistance for all developing countries registered a remarkable stability ranging from 0.32 per cent to 0.34 per cent of donor gross national product .  
Island developing countries should seek to exploit fully , within the limits of sustainability , their agricultural potential and marine resources in the exclusive economic zones by enhancing relevant skills and carrying out specialized studies on the conservation , management and surveillance of these resources .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
UNCTAD , in its field of competence and in collaboration with relevant regional and international organizations as well as non-governmental organizations , should be prepared to extend to island developing countries its technical cooperation capacity in respect of policies for sustainable economic development .  
The FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 1995 endorsed the creation of a Fisheries Technical Assistance Programme for small island developing States , focusing on the following priority areas , as identified by countries : institutional strengthening and capacity-building ; conservation and management of fisheries in the exclusive economic zone ; improved post-harvest management and marketing ; safety at sea ; strengthening the economic role of national fisheries industries ; and aquaculture and inland fisheries conservation and management .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
Thus , an advanced and prosperous State using flooding as a means of irrigation may be required to develop a more efficient , less wasteful system ; on the other hand , a developing State using the same method may be granted additional time to obtain the resources needed for the required improvements .  
In accordance with the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space concerning the development of indigenous capabilities , General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in which the Assembly endorsed the recommendation of the Committee that the United Nations should lead , with the active support of its specialized agencies and other international organizations , an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology in existing national / regional educational institutions in the developing countries , and resolution 50 / 27  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
The report highlights important findings announced at the London meeting , namely , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominately cereal diets of most developing countries .  
The following narratives of ESCAP assistance to the concerned countries include : ( i ) adoption of the international standards and practices of countries with market economies , ( ii ) analytical activities , policy advice and technical assistance to the economies in transition , and ( iii ) possible ways of enhancing economic and technical cooperation among countries with economies in transition and with developing countries , in particular through cooperation with regional and subregional groupings .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 reflects the following priorities : maintenance of peace and security , promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective response to humanitarian emergencies ; and promotion of justice and international law .  
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
By its resolutions 44 / 215 , 46 / 210 , 48 / 168 and 50 / 96 , the General Assembly urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
The Panel recognized the importance of international cooperation for the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , particularly in developing countries , in spite of the fact that it was each country 's responsibility to develop policies that would create an enabling environment for private , bilateral and multilateral investments in the forest sector .  
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
During its sixteenth session , in January 1996 , the Council decided to give priority , in its future activities , to regional and subregional projects , and reaffirmed its support of projects aiming , in particular at improving the quality of communication for development ; promoting freedom of the press , pluralism and independence of the media ; promoting democracy and human rights ; supporting activities for broader participation of women in the media ; and developing community media etc .  
As reported in the annual overview report for 1993 , the information received regarding additional measures or special assistance in response to the immediate hardships encountered and urgent needs faced by the affected countries was largely of a preliminary nature , which reflected the need to assess the extent of the impact of sanctions on the economies of the affected countries in order to assist them in developing appropriate policy responses and in preparing financial requirements for remedial measures . 
In its resolution 50 / 203 , the General Assembly reaffirmed that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , would also be required . 
The prospective growth environment for developing countries will depend not only on their continuing significant policy adjustments but also on sustained and strong momentum in global trade liberalization leading to rapid growth in world trade .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Apart from considering substantive issues related to the integration and more active participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system , this meeting also demonstrated the strong will of the above organizations for joint cooperation and a tangible manifestation of complementarity among them .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
Activities being initiated include reviewing the current state of interpreting modelling work for sustainable development ; formulating recommendations for improving existing integrated modelling work for sustainable development ; developing a linked set of models for integrated global and regional assessments of sustainable development ; stimulating the development and use of integrated models in developing countries ; and providing support to relevant activities of different bodies . 
It will also draw up specific programmes as follow-up to the decisions taken in Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable Development regarding the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional financial resources to developing countries , and mechanisms for the transfer of technology to those countries , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed in paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 " .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
In response to the Summit 's call for increased cooperation at all levels , the regional commissions are expected to play a major role in supporting the implementation of the objectives set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action , in particular to assist developing countries , Africa and the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition .  
In its resolution 50 / 161 , the General Assembly reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
The Ministers agreed to reduce dependence on the information and cultural media of the industrialized nations by initiating and supporting cooperative activities through fresh and dynamic approaches to programming , message content and networking in the media systems of non-aligned and other developing countries .  
The Ministers emphasized the need for information and communication strategies to be rooted in deep historical and cultural processes , and urged that the views , models and perspectives of the media of developed countries not be allowed to determine to an undue extent the style and orientation of media policies in developing countries .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 49 / 108 on industrial development cooperation , inter alia , stressed the importance of industrialization to the economic and social development of developing countries ; emphasized the importance of industrial development cooperation ; reaffirmed the central coordinating role played by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) in the United Nations system in the field of industrial development in the developing countries ; and welcomed the process of reform and restructuring of UNIDO .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
We express our commitment to the elaboration and implementation of a strategy for the physical integration of the region , aware of the urgent task of developing an adequate transport and communications infrastructure , and we therefore call on the competent national authorities to pursue their efforts in that direction . 
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
In 1994 , the United States of America , Canada , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Australia experienced relatively strong economic growth ; economic recovery accelerated in continental Europe ; Japan started to show signs of improved economic activities ; and the developing economies experienced above average growth rates .  
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1566 ( L ) , the Council considered that the ultimate goal of the work of the Commission should be the achievement of an integrated system in the collection , data processing and dissemination of international statistics by the organs and agencies of the United Nations system with special regard to the requirements of reviewing and appraising economic and social progress , taking into account the needs of the developing countries . 
To promote awareness , both in developed and in developing countries , of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , of the human rights aspects of family planning , and of possible strategies to deal with them , in accordance with the plans and priorities of each country ;  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .  
The Assembly requested relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions to strengthen their efforts to assist interested developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national water policies and strategies , and called upon the international community to give special attention to the revitalization of economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries , through , inter alia , a more diversified food and agriculture sector .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
Furthermore , the Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services , stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , and requested the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen the Programme by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandates . 
Governments recognized UNCTAD 's technical cooperation programme as an important element in providing practical assistance to developing countries , especially those with the greatest need , and committed themselves to strengthening its effectiveness and impact as an essential complement to the institution 's policy-oriented analytical and deliberative work .  
Nevertheless , there were some problems of a more fundamental nature , such as the facts that full and prompt delivery of revenues was not possible because of late payments by many Member States , that a number of Member States were deliberately violating the obligations entered into under the Charter with regard to the operation of the methodology and that severe imbalances in the distribution of revenue-sourcing were inevitable while so many developing countries continued to be impoverished by the existing economic system .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
At the same time , in many developing countries , the formulation of coherent and implementable national strategies is contingent on adequate international support , technical and financial .  
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation also expressed the urgent need for the international community to call upon certain developed countries immediately to eliminate laws and regulations with adverse extra-territorial impacts and other forms of coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation called for urgent and immediate generation of political will in the international community to follow up and implement the recommendations of recent United Nations conferences , in particular commitments to new and additional financing for development and creation of a favourable international economic environment , inter alia , through transfer of technology and enhanced trade access of products from developing countries .  
They expressed their concern over the deterioration of the food and agriculture situation in developing countries , reaffirmed the need to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural policies as fundamental objectives of development and asserted that the right to food was a fundamental human right , the respect and promotion of which constitute a moral imperative for the international community .  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
Mr . MAHUGU ( Kenya ) , after endorsing the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that while current economic indicators revealed widespread world economic growth , with the developing countries having registered an aggregate GDP growth of over 5 per cent , that growth rate concealed sharp regional , subregional and national differences .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
Further deepening of the development process would require an internationally agreed framework that would facilitate the stable , non-discriminatory and reasonable access of developing countries to technology , on the basis of a more transparent , critical and objective evaluation of the restrictions imposed on the grounds of alleged " dual use " .  
Like many developing countries , it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries ' failure to contribute , in clear and specific terms , the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Third , the multilateral system should be strengthened ; in that regard , the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , to be held in Singapore , would focus on improving market access for developing countries and on the contribution of regional cooperation to the global integration process .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
Mr . MWAKAWAGO ( United Republic of Tanzania ) said that the international community was looking forward to the twenty-first century with a mixture of hope and despair : hope for the opportunities created by the liberalized and globalized markets of the future , and despair over the persisting high levels of poverty , especially in developing countries , which could undermine the advantages deriving from expanded markets and global partnership , unless the vicious cycle of poverty was broken and a process of economic recovery and growth was initiated .  
Also reaffirms that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there is a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , and calls upon those countries in a position to do so to increase their contributions to the United Nations Population Fund ;  
In a statement of 23 April 1996 on the situation of human rights in Colombia , the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to proceed , upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing , to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country , making analytical reports to the High Commissioner .  
In 1994-1995 , following the support provided in the area of health policy and planning as well as in definition of proposals for decentralized projects through bilaterals , WHO 's work focused on the following : definition of a post-war strategy for rehabilitation of the public health sector and sustained development ; definition of possible health-care financing alternative ; technical support and training of nationals in developing a health insurance scheme ; completing policy frameworks on resource allocation and urban health care ; and providing technical support in the areas of health insurance .  
In 1995-1996 , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 's ( UNIDO ) technical cooperation programmes with the front-line States focused on , inter alia , the following : developing support strategies and formulating policies for accelerated industrial development ; providing support for developing existing industries and industrial infrastructures ; private sector development with emphasis on strengthening private sector institutions ; small and medium enterprises development ; and industrial information investment and technology promotion .  
The issue of resources for operational activities , however , was particularly important because , in the view of her delegation , if resources could not be increased on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired , developing countries ' development programmes would be jeopardized and , in the long run , international development cooperation would be affected .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Are convinced that sustainable development and the utilization of solar energy would be enhanced by local and national capacity-building , policy reform and technology-sharing among nations , with an emphasis on coherent efforts towards technology acquisition and development in the developing countries . 
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Urges all States to strive for effective and harmonious international cooperation in carrying out the work of the Agency , pursuant to its statute ; in promoting the use of nuclear energy and the application of the necessary measures to strengthen further the safety of nuclear installations and to minimize risks to life , health and the environment ; in strengthening technical assistance and cooperation for developing countries ; and in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards systems of the Agency ;  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Urges all States to strive for effective and harmonious international cooperation in carrying out the work of the Agency , pursuant to its statute ; in promoting the use of nuclear energy and the application of the necessary measures to strengthen further the safety of nuclear installations and to minimize risks to life , health and the environment ; in strengthening technical assistance and cooperation for developing countries ; and in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards systems of the Agency ;  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
That being said , it was obvious that there were still dramatic variations between regions , and the question was whether the current relatively robust growth in the developing countries as a whole would translate itself into a widespread improvement of living conditions and especially into poverty reduction worldwide . 
The United Nations system had been a major actor in promoting a holistic approach to development - linking social , economic and environmental considerations - in all the developing countries , as evidenced by the organization and outcome of a number of international conferences , especially the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the International Conference on Population and Development , the World Summit for Social Development , and the Fourth World Conference on Women . 
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
Now that the countries of the Rio Group had implemented the adjustments and modernizations required for their social and economic development , and in order to achieve the objectives of the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation and the International Development Strategy , it was to be hoped that the developed countries would also assume their responsibility to create a favourable international environment for cooperation and economic development , especially with regard to the developing countries .  
Although each country was responsible for its own economic policy , the reactivation of economic growth and development in all countries required a coordinated effort by the entire international community ; accordingly , particular attention should be paid to the needs of countries with economies in transition , without thereby reducing assistance to developing countries . 
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Welcomes action at the national and regional level by small island developing States , and invites all Governments , with the assistance of international and regional organizations , to continue to support and to provide information on all of their major activities under the Programme of Action so as to enable an adequate review of the aforementioned action taken at the national and regional level ;  
To initiate action , including consultations with Parties and relevant international organizations , inter alia , taking into account the ongoing work of the Climate Technology Initiative , to identify existing technology information activities and needs , with a view to developing options for building on existing specialized information centres and networks to provide fast and one-stop databases relating to state-of-the-art , environmentally sound and economically feasible technology and know-how in a manner that would be readily accessible to developing countries .  
In providing the financial resources needed by developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 4.1 of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.3 , take steps to facilitate this provision of financial resources , including the enhancement of transparency and the flexible and pragmatic application of its concept of incremental costs on a case-by-case basis ;  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
India fully supported the need for global efforts to address the whole range of refugee-related problems , including their security and protection , international solidarity and burden-sharing , supporting the capacity of host States to receive and protect refugees , seeking sustainable solutions to refugee problems within countries of origin in order to prevent new exoduses , developing durable solutions and creating conditions for the repatriation of refugees in a manner that ensured their safety and their effective reintegration .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Although the special circumstances of developing countries are recognized in many specific instances throughout the revised version , there is no separate chapter or annex devoted to those circumstances ( as in the previous version ) .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Portugal 's domestic legislation provided for the criminal responsibility of legal persons , including that of the State , and there were merits in developing the concept of international criminal responsibility , but the draft articles did not include specific consequences attached to a crime as opposed to a mere wrongful act .  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
His delegation in principle supported the standby arrangements and felt that developing countries , in particular , troop-contributors , should be well represented in the composition of a rapidly deployable headquarters team , which would enhance broad international support for its effective functioning .  
It looked forward to working with the Netherlands and the Russian Federation towards the development of the programme 's substantive content , and stressed the importance of developing activities to commemorate those occasions at the regional as well as the global level .  
The President of Mongolia , in his address to the General Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , had emphasized the importance of developing a set of ground rules for the pacific settlement of disputes , an idea further developed by Mongolia 's Prime Minister in his recent address to the General Assembly when he had called on the international community to elaborate the guiding principles for conducting international negotiations .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
It was paradoxical that those States which were the most vocal critics of the developing countries ' record on human rights were silent upon the subject of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The purpose was to provide graduates , sponsored by their Governments , with the opportunity to work in the field under the direction of senior experts or senior staff members of the United Nations in order to assist developing countries through the implementation of technical cooperation projects .  Over the course of time , a number of such associate experts have been assigned to functions carried out by offices at headquarters , usually in economic and social research and analysis ; those at headquarters offices are also sometimes referred to as " junior professional officers " .  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Concessional , bilateral contributions from the developed countries were crucial in that regard , as was a favourable international economic environment , characterized by improved access to markets , stable exchange rates , effectively managed international interest rates , increased resource flows and access by the developing countries to technology .  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
Other issues that must be addressed included the problems faced by developing countries , particularly those in Africa , concerning access to markets , capital and technology , unfavourable institutional arrangements and inadequate capacity for their meaningful integration into the world economy .  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
Rejects coercive extraterritorial measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women and the elderly ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments ; thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
The key factors which contribute to inefficient energy-use in the transport sector are growing road congestion in urban areas , increasing dependence on cars , and use of vehicles which are not fuel efficient coupled with poor vehicle and road maintenance in developing countries .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The General Assembly could not remain silent at the gross and systematic violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of the populations of developing countries caused by such measures , which were in flagrant violation of international law .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments ; thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
The coming to power of the coalition of the right-wing Likud with other extreme forces a few months ago led to the application of their declared programme , which aims at increasing Jewish immigration , consolidating , expanding , developing and increasing the number of settlements , and imposing land seizures and forceful expropriation .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Reaffirms also the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ; 
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular , to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
He was delighted to see that UNCTAD activities which were of importance to his country - such as assistance to developing and transitional economies in integrating into the international trade system , restrictive business practices and competition issues , trade in services , the interrelationship between trade and environment , and the impact of economic regionalization on the multilateral trade system - were duly reflected .  
Commenting on the need to assist many developing countries , especially the least developed countries , with the promotion of exports , he said the EU had taken note of the suggestion in the Trade and Development Report 1996 for establishing an international marketing and information service , but was of the view that such assistance should take place at a level as close as possible to the relevant industry and be based upon detailed understanding of export capabilities .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
While welcoming the increase in the share of technical cooperation accounted for by services infrastructure and trade efficiency , as well as the continuing positive trends in the area of global interdependence , including debt management , the African group was preoccupied by the weakening of programmes on commodities , science and technology and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
Much remained to be done to advance the cause in terms of the tasks assigned to the Commissions and expert meetings , for the main challenge ahead was to perfect a pragmatic approach that would enable the international community to deal with the development problem in a globalized world economy and to endow UNCTAD with efficient and modern instruments for helping the developing countries to meet this challenge .  
The issues of the environment and development required a global rather than a selective approach ; for the developing countries , the eradication of poverty , together with economic and social development , remained the first priorities and should be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development .  
" Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments ; thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Decides to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
" Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
A solid scientific , technological and industrial capability accumulated in developing detection and mine-clearing equipment allows us to participate in promising international programmes in the field .  
Letter dated 20 November 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Zimbabwe to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General , transmitting a joint communiqu entitled " The current international trading system and prospects for the promotion of trade among developing countries " , released at the sixth meeting of the Summit Level Group of Developing Countries , held at Harare from 3 to 5 November 1996 ( A / C . 2 / 51 / 10 ) .  
" Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
" Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
At the end of the first preambular paragraph , the words " other relevant international agreements concerning international cooperation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries " were replaced with the words " the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summit meetings held since the beginning of the 1990s " ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
" Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action , with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
In addition , the Secretary-General considers that , in developing criteria for accelerated promotion called for in recommendation 1 ( h ) and paragraph 78 of the JIU report , demonstrated mobility should be among the main criteria , bearing in mind , of course , those categories or occupational groups of staff which are not expected to be mobile ( e.g . staff in the General Service and related categories ) , or for whom mobility opportunities are limited .  
For the appropriate management of high seas fisheries as well as that of the exclusive economic zones , the developed countries should transfer the necessary technology to developing countries to enable them better to conduct scientific research , handle data and pursue fisheries operations in a more responsible manner .  We now face the formidable task of implementing the comprehensive global framework of ocean management .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries domestic resources for the financing , management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
Schools , universities , professional and vocational training programmes and institutions should be encouraged and assisted in developing human rights curricula and corresponding teaching and resource materials , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes , for incorporation into formal education at the early childhood , primary , secondary , post-secondary and adult education levels .  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
Each national focal point should be charged with identifying national human rights education needs , developing a national plan of action , raising funds , coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade and reporting to the High Commissioner for Human Rights on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade ;  
Following the decision of the Committee to promote international cooperation in space science and technology , the United Nations Programme on Space Applications was established with the objective , inter alia , of providing scientists from developing countries with educational programmes in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communication and basic space science .  
Because of the increasing number of developing countries that are actively engaged in space science research , the United Nations , through the Programme and the Committee , has in recent years placed increased emphasis on promoting education and research in space science and technology and , in particular , planetary exploration and astronomy ( topics covered in a guidebook3 published for International Space Year , 1992 ) , comprising what has come to be known in the international space community as basic space science .  
The increasing costs of big science projects and a changing international research atmosphere have fostered the trend in the scientific community to focus on the development of large , internationally funded facilities capable of taking advantage of the climatological and geographical attributes of any country , particularly developing countries .  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that BOT and other forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to re-allocate resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
In its resolution 1996 / 27 of 29 August 1996 , the Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General , in accordance with Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 290 , to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions and its relationship to internationally recognized human rights , with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions , and to submit the report on the seminar , together with the guidelines , to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
The same can be said of the pioneering efforts under way towards linking international organizations , both governmental and non-governmental , with national and private multinational banks in order to provide the funds and services which small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in transitional and developing countries require for sustainable development activities .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
Also , both the Teledesic Corporation and Sky Station International declared that they would provide some of their telecommunications capacity free of charge to developing countries , meaning several regions and countries would have free access to some of the fastest communications available for health or educational purposes .  NULLBecause of the tremendous advances in telecommunications technology , a new global community is emerging .  
The Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held at Bridgetown , Barbados , in 1994 , noted that small island developing States are prone to extremely damaging natural disasters , primarily in the form of severe weather , volcanic eruptions and earth-quakes ( A / CONF . 167 / 9 ) .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The instrument should be developed in such a manner as to recognize ongoing activities on persistent organic pollutants and other related issues and institutions , as well as differing regional and national conditions and taking into account the special concerns of developing countries and countries with economies in transition ;  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The technical cooperation programme has focused on incorporating international human rights standards in national legal systems , developing policies and practices and building national capacities and regional structures for the promotion and protection of all human rights , democracy and the rule of law .  
Reaffirms the great potential of technical cooperation among developing countries , which has now gained widespread acceptance as an innovative and effective instrument of technical cooperation , and urges developing countries that have not yet done so to elaborate national policies and strategies for technical cooperation among developing countries so as to give full effect to this form of cooperation ;  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
That desire becomes even more urgent given that the boundless mind of man has produced numerous miraculous inventions , opening up a new era called the post-industrial era or the information age , while more than a quarter of the developing world 's population still lives in poverty , some 840-million go hungry or face food insecurity , and even in industrial countries more than 100-million people live below the poverty line and 37-million are jobless . 
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
The struggle of developing countries to eradicate poverty , achieve economic and social progress and attain conditions of sustained economic growth and sustainable development has as a prerequisite sine qua non the establishment of a more propitious and dynamic economic environment .  
Two years ago , during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we committed ourselves not only to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , but also to rededicate our efforts to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness for our universal Organization , with a view to enabling it to play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable development , particularly in the developing countries .  
Cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU requires for its continued success an effective , vibrant , modern and reformed United Nations , responsive to the concerns of the vast majority of its Members , the developing countries .  
The task of developing a culture of peace would require comprehensive educational , cultural , social and civic action based on a commonality of interest and shared goals .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
The Agency justifiably has a strong reputation for generating ideas and initiating practical actions aimed at enhancing nuclear safety and security by undertaking the dual functions of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime and developing peaceful cooperation in the use of atomic energy .  
Despite the negative public perception created in some countries and the fears aroused about the dangers of nuclear proliferation , nuclear energy remains a viable and attractive energy option for many countries , and particularly for the fossil fuel-deficient developing countries .  
I have already stated that the United Nations must play a constructive and catalytic role , within its macroeconomic policies to facilitate economic growth for sustained development , thereby enabling developing countries , which constitute the vast majority of the Members of the Organization , to have an equal share in the opportunities for wealth creation .  
In fact , we are aware and convinced that merely meeting the requirements of the ritual of holding periodic elections is not enough and can in no way be considered decisive in establishing and guaranteeing lasting democracy in a country , particularly in a developing country such as my own , which is classified among the least developed .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
The United Arab Emirates pins great hopes on international development assistance in support of plans for the establishment of national Palestinian institutions and for developing the local technical capacities of the Palestinian people in order to enable it to implement its economic and social development plans with a view to its proper integration into international trade .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
Contributing to the widening economic and social gap between the developed and the developing States , these phenomena in no way help to further the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a new international economic order that is both equitable and just and that could serve as a solid and reliable foundation for peace , security , stability and development throughout the world .  
Regional and international arms races and military expenditure do not merely threaten international peace and security and the stability of States ; they also absorb tremendous amounts of national economic and financial resources , particularly in the developing countries that so sorely need those resources to achieve their aspirations to economic and social development .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .  
While we recognized that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations , it was also recognized that meeting the environmental objectives in Agenda 21 would place additional , even onerous , burdens on developing countries .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Strengthened international cooperation and the application of appropriate national policy will also contribute to ensuring a stable environment conducive to promoting social development , including reduction of unemployment and generation of productive employment in developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
In most developing countries , the formal sector is incapable of providing a sufficient number of jobs to meet existing and future projected requirements .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
In the context of reform of the United Nations in general and of the regional commissions in particular , the role of statistics divisions should be enhanced towards more efficient monitoring of progress in global and regional developments , as well as towards assisting the national statistical organizations of developing countries to become more responsive to national and international needs for timely and efficient statistics .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
In this sense , international cooperation , including financial and technical support , is a duty of States in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic and industrialized countries are encouraged to act in a spirit of solidarity in assisting developing countries to meet the challenges of implementing the Guidelines .  
A partnership for development should be forged in which developed and developing countries would undertake , in a framework of growing interdependence and joint responsibility , to establish sensible national policies and an international climate conducive to sustainable and accelerated development .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
In the fourth review and appraisal , representatives of non-governmental organizations have been included in 31 ( 72 per cent ) of the national coordinating mechanisms : 48 per cent in developed countries , and 62 per cent in developing countries , a slightly higher level than that reported in 1992 .  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
For the present report , data were sought through UNFPA 's network of offices in the developing countries via a concise questionnaire , realizing that , given the small size of UNFPA field offices and the fact that field offices do not have a data-collection function as part of their regular responsibilities , the data gathered would be preliminary and fragmentary in nature .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
The ban on the export of hazardous products , including those intended for recycling , which has now been imposed by the Basel Convention would remain a dead letter if it were not accompanied by practical measures for the detection of illicit practices .  This can be achieved only by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
In this regard , the promulgation of strict legislation to control transboundary movements of dangerous wastes should be continued and , in particular , encouraged in the developing countries in order to reduce the discrepancies between the national legal norms applied in the developed and the developing countries .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
This involves improving competitiveness in telecommunications , continuing with the technological development of Earth observation , developing advanced scientific instrumentation , carrying out work in orbital infrastructures and acquiring techniques for future launchers .  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
Taking into consideration the overall needs of the country , the expected core resources of the United Nations agencies and the unique operating environment , the United Nations , together with non-governmental organizations spent the latter half of 1996 developing a joint strategy for efficient and targeted assistance in four main areas : emergencies , reintegration , rehabilitation and governance .  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
While welcoming the existence of government bodies competent to deal with the welfare of children at the national level , the Committee expresses its concern at the insufficient coordination between these bodies as well as between national and local bodies in developing a comprehensive approach to the implementation of the Convention .  
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .  
It serves as an expert facility and repository of technical information relating to the sustainable development of small hydropower operations as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy , particularly in rural areas of developing countries .  
The Philippines - as expressed in previous comments - favoured the draft minimum rules and stated that the Department of Justice of the Philippines was developing several activities intended to improve the capabilities of prosecutors and enhance the working relations among law enforcers and trial court judges , in order to fulfil the desired goals set by the draft minimum rules .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
Observing scientifically the changes in the international situation , Mr . Deng Xiaoping led us in the reshaping of an international strategy adhering to an independent foreign policy of peace , safeguarding world peace , promoting world development and opposing hegemonism and power politics , thus opening up a new situation in China 's relations with foreign countries in a new era , and making historic contributions to developing and strengthening China 's friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
The central collective leadership , with President Jiang Zemin at its core , will lead the Chinese people in carrying forward the behest of Mr . Deng Xiaoping , advancing the great cause pioneered by him : building China into a prosperous , democratic and civilized socialist country , and developing friendly relations of cooperation with all countries in the world , thus making more , and greater , contributions to peace , development and the progress of mankind .  
The arming of Armenia on such a large scale and the sharp build-up of its military might in violation of international legal norms , at a time when relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation are improving and steadily developing , poses a real threat to the entire region .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The ultimate objective of BITs from the point of view of developing host countries is to contribute to a favourable investment climate , with a view to attracting more FDI flows and , ultimately , advancing the economic and social development of the host countries involved .  
WWhat are the lessons to be learned from BITs as regards increasing the quantity and quality of investment flows and advancing sustainable social and economic development in host developing countries ? 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Even though there was no specific mention to this effect in the response received from the Netherlands , it is known that the country , along with other developed countries , such as Japan , participates in triangular arrangements , whereby the services of suitable developing countries are utilized to deliver a technical cooperation input to another developing country .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development , and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Emphasizes the need for new flows of financial resources to the indebted developing countries , and urges the creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase financial assistance on favourable terms as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty , and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
The view was expressed that reference to practical problems in the implementation of equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit presupposed that there were no prior legal problems in the implementation of equitable access , particularly for the developing countries .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Recognizes that institutions responsible for sustaining the rule of law play an important role in removing the causes of mass exoduses and , in this context , calls on the High Commissioner to continue his efforts , at the request of the Governments concerned , to reinforce national legal , judicial and administrative capacity , including training opportunities through technical cooperation programmes in countries of origin as well as host countries , particularly developing countries ;  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
An important dimension implicit in regional and subregional operational activities , that of the practice and potential for technical cooperation among developing countries , needs to be made more explicit so that more opportunities for such cooperation can be exploited .  
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
The deferral of two expert group meetings , one on the macroeconomic effects of drug trafficking in selected developing countries and economies in transition and the other on new forms of international cooperation in law enforcement with particular reference to the problems of transit States , has affected the level of understanding of drug trafficking patterns in the geographic areas in question . 
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the least developed and landlocked developing countries have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and other international declarations .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the Pacific island developing countries related to their isolation , small size and vulnerability to environmental hazards have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and other international declarations .  
Convinced that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic , social and related fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of its subsidiary bodies located in the developing regions ,  
Nevertheless , these decisive changes did not come about easily and had to make their way within an extremely hostile international setting marked by the cold war , and at a time when the so _ called national security doctrine was becoming established in many developing countries and across virtually the whole of the American continent .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
Stress that no discriminatory environmental instrument or agreement should be enforced regarding elimination of persistent organic pollutants in the absence of viable inputs vital for sustained increase in food production in all developing countries , including the SAARC countries , and that all efforts should be made to provide alternative chemicals and technology for production of these alternatives on non-commercial terms to enable developing countries to phase out the elimination of such persistent organic pollutants ;  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The Secretariat will further be required to assist developing country Parties , on request , particularly those in Africa , in the preparation of their national , subregional and regional communications ; to analyze , collate and present those communications so as to facilitate their consideration by the COP ; to facilitate the consultative and coordination processes as set out in the relevant regional implementation annexes ; to ensure coordination with the secretariats of other relevant bodies ; and to assist in promoting public awareness of the Convention to Combat Desertification ( CCD ) .  
We thank the UNCTAD secretariat for having convened this Expert Meeting , as well as for the preparatory work and the documentation , all of which is contributing to a more profound analysis of trade in relation to health services - an area in which many countries , largely developing countries like Cuba , are striving to become competitive in an international market dominated to all intents and purposes by the large transnational corporations . 
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
Many States have successfully implemented comparatively rapid procedures at points of entry which ensure a fair and competent assessment of the need for international protection , and UNHCR encourages States to ensure the rights of the individual through proper legal safeguards , in developing such procedures .  
The contribution which foreign direct investment can make to development is widely recognized , including as a source of capital as well as of managerial , technical and marketing know-how necessary for the development of new and viable manufacturing , services and resource-based industries in developing countries .  
The transfer of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies to developing countries relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms . "  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
As for trade statistics , the mission focused attention on : ( i ) ascertaining the technical capabilities and work plan of the PCBS with regard to the compilation , processing , analysis , and dissemination of Palestinian foreign trade statistics ; ( ii ) identifying the nature and extent of needs of the PCBS for technical assistance in the area of international trade statistics ; and , ( iii ) developing relevant proposals for manpower training .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
The draft resolution was essentially a procedural document dealing with institutional links between the United Nations and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the necessary financial support , but listed in its preambular part the main events that had occurred during the year pursuant to the Convention , which was of crucial importance to many developing countries . 
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
The terms active or productive ageing are currently used in two ways : first , to describe , and thereby to support , the importance of the many socially and economically productive roles open to ageing individuals in developing countries and , secondly , as an attempt to reverse the phenomenon in developed countries whereby retirement from the formal economic sector automatically negates the formal acknowledgment of the unpaid productive roles of many older persons . 
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
The granting of preferential access to external markets , through bilateral , regional and international agreements , would greatly enhance the investment promotion efforts of developing countries , particularly smaller economies , as a minimum market size is an important prerequisite for many investors .  
In its resolution 50 / 119 of 20 December 1995 , entitled Economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to present to it on a biennial basis a report entitled State of South-South cooperation containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in that regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
That training is implemented in cooperation with the five education development centres , one in each Field , and covers a wide range of courses of one - , two - or three-year duration aimed at certifying unqualified elementary and preparatory teachers or vocational training instructors , meeting curricular changes and developing the supervisory and leadership skills of senior education staff .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
However , foreign direct investment in developing countries , as well as the recent parallel surge in international portfolio investment , has been concentrated in the more advanced economies , the larger economies and those with high rates of economic growth .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in science and technology of developing countries , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The need for an integrated and intersectoral approach to health strategies has been recognized , as well as the importance of strengthening national and international efforts to prevent and combat epidemics and other diseases that are endemic in many developing countries , and in particular to address malaria and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) more effectively .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
The Seventh United Nations International Training Course on Remote Sensing Education for Educators , held at Stockholm and Kiruna , Sweden , from 5 May to 13 June 1997 , was organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Application in cooperation with the Government of Sweden . The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce remote sensing courses in their respective academic institutions .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
While the formulation of common standards for prudential oversight and management of risk situations and efforts to involve developing countries and countries with transition economies were welcome , States remained responsible for the establishment of a stable and predictable national environment for foreign investment .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
Given that the five Central Asian Republics are landlocked , in search of world markets and in need of developing new transport corridors to improve trade performance , UNDP is providing support to the Government of Tajikistan to pave the way for a modern system of transit procedures and ensure adherence to international customs conventions that simplify border crossings among the five Central Asian Countries , resulting in reduced transport costs , increased competitiveness , expanded trade potential and augmented economic growth .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .  
Throughout the session , intensive consultations , both formal and informal , were held under the authority of the successive Presidents with a view to clarifying positions and developing a minimum common ground which would allow the Conference to discharge its mandate as the sole multilateral negotiating forum of the international community in the field of disarmament .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Despite their economic limitations , the developing countries had made strenuous efforts to achieve the objectives of the Programme , and in particular to integrate more fully demographic changes and the development processes , since population programmes were accepted as a fundamental component of any viable strategy for sustainable economic and social development .  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
As many here are aware , it is this objective which has led to Canada and others developing a comprehensive programme for Ottawa this December , when other practical measures will be further elaborated in such fields as demining , victim assistance and social and economic rehabilitation .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
It was emphasized that the original raison d \ x { 76bb } re of trade preferences in providing developing countries with preferred market access to their major markets is even more relevant in the present world of heightened global competition juxtaposed with continuing supply-side difficulties in developing countries .  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The key role of the United Nations , which is central to the process , is therefore one of providing expert assistance , drawing on the extensive experience of the international community in developing and implementing such integrated humanitarian mine-action programmes .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts , including bilateral cooperation , in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 , within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building of developing countries in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
Taking note also of the Declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their twenty-first annual meeting , [ 3 ] held in New York on 26 September 1997 , in which the Ministers emphasized the increasing importance and complementarity of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries as a means of supporting and broadening the global partnership in international development cooperation ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that various forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to reallocate the resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
Some other delegations considered the draft declaration to be a relevant , realistic and timely proposal , reflecting the need for consolidating and developing a proper legal basis and procedures for peacekeeping , preventive and other relevant operations of the United Nations .  
He stated that with the apparent weakening of the commitment to development cooperation on the part of the traditional partners , TCDC and South-South cooperation represented the best hope for the developing countries in the context of the emerging global order , although it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional development cooperation .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions , both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings , but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
We firmly believe that the aims of any reform designed to restructure the Organization and rationalize its expenditures can be attained only if due account is taken of the interests of the developing countries and , above all , if reform provides for a solution to their economic and social problems as well as the provision of material and technical means required for these ends .  
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
Such rampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the currency and equity markets of developing countries , at a time when they are still feeling their way in a world of fierce global competition , would trigger off a defensive reflex on the part of the affected countries , thereby arousing anti-liberalization , which would be detrimental to free trade .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
We are fully aware that at the level of the United Nations , there have been a number of initiatives designed to help address the economic and social problems faced by developing countries and to mitigate the effects of poverty and the impact of those conditions hindering the realization of sustainable economic development .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
As a least developed country itself , the Republic of Yemen expresses its concern regarding some indications in the report that the United Nations role in the field of development may be reduced and its responsibilities limited in the field of social justice and the task of narrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and developed industrialized countries all on the pretext that some of these responsibilities have been shifted elsewhere . 
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
As regards debt , a genuine obstacle to development for many countries of the South , my delegation supports any initiative aimed at finding effective , fair , lasting and development-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign debt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries .  
In concluding , let me say that while Indonesia will continue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level to translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development into genuine social progress , we will also continue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable position for the developing countries within the international community .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
We are confident that the Secretary-General will ensure the continuing institutional capacity of the Organization to respond adequately to the needs of States , newly established institutions and other competent international organizations by providing advice and assistance , taking into account the special needs of developing countries .  
I can not conclude this brief statement without drawing attention to the equally deplorable activities of some industrialized States , which dump toxic and hazardous wastes , especially in the waters of developing States , or carry out other forms of pollution through the deliberate discharge of pollutants such as oil and oily wastes , noxious liquids or solids , and sewage or garbage .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
It is in this context that Central America is developing a complex and lasting network of reciprocal cooperation for development which includes extensive and ambitious projects such as the privatization of public enterprises or the implementation of reforms intended to make its production systems more flexible , as well as the concerted decision to boost competitiveness and take measures to preserve and support its institutions .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
To most developing countries , the sustainable development approach , as emphasized by most of our developed partners , is considered restrictive , limiting economic growth to social development and protection of the environment .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
I am especially pleased that the General Assembly has elected to this very responsible function a very competent representative from Ukraine , a friendly country with which the Republic of Macedonia is developing successful cooperation .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
In discussing its terms of reference , Committee members attached particular importance to ( a ) assessing world development trends and prospects ; ( b ) identifying national and international policies that would enhance the ability of developing countries and economies in transition to participate effectively in a globalizing world economy and achieve the goals agreed at United Nations global conferences ; and ( c ) undertaking periodic reviews of the list of least developed countries and the criteria used for identifying them .  
The Committee agreed to examine the following issues related to the impact of globalization on development : ( a ) globalization trends in trade , capital flows and technology transfer ; ( b ) factors leading to a homogeneous policy regime and its implications for development ; ( c ) implications of globalization for the international economy and international governance ; ( d ) recommendations for national policies , institutions and governance in developing countries ; ( e ) recommendations for policies in developed countries ; and ( f ) recommendations for policies of international organizations .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
While the proportion of people in absolute poverty may have been reduced as a result of rapid economic growth in some very large low-income developing countries ( notably China and India ) , the process of globalization has been accompanied by an increasing economic gap between the high and middle-income countries and the least developed countries . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
The constraints on tax administration in developing countries include insufficient skilled personnel , inadequate equipment , problems of supervision and motivation of public sector employees , inadequately defined or overly complex tax rates , difficulty in identifying taxpayers and in punishing tax evaders , and inadequate accounting practices .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries . 
The Committee agreed that the independence and extensive experience of its members in a wide range of development-related fields provided it with a comparative advantage as a forum for the discussion and review of emerging development issues facing developing countries , particularly where such issues were cross-sectoral or cut across the responsibilities of various international bodies or agencies .  
Convinced further that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic and social fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of Headquarters and the subsidiary organs located in the developing regions ,  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
The main activities are aimed at , inter alia , raising public awareness , improving understanding of money-laundering , promoting the adoption of relevant legislation , improving law enforcement capacities to combat money-laundering , training and developing infrastructure for the implementation of an effective money-laundering strategy .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
The potential danger posed by the frequent passage of commercial vessels , and on occasion vessels carrying hazardous , toxic and radioactive wastes through the high seas surrounding a number of small island developing States , continues unattenuated .  
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
The disappointing results in the utilization of renewable energy sources are attributable mainly to a lack of information on the economic and technical viability of the technologies in small island developing States , and unaffordable prices of existing technologies , especially solar energy technology .  
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
One set of concerns focuses on the environmental , economic and social consequences of the resource-intensive consumption patterns of the developed world - and , increasingly , the rapidly industrializing countries - another on the multiple problems bound up with economic stagnation , poverty and environmental degradation in some developing countries .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
The Conference of the Parties decided that the restructured GEF should continue , on an interim basis , to serve as the institutional structure on an interim basis , and in its decisions II / 6 and II / 7 instructed GEF to facilitate urgent implementation of articles 6 and 8 of the Convention by making available to developing country Parties financial resources for projects in a flexible and expeditious manner .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
In the initial consultations between UNESCO , UNEP and IUCN on developing a broad international alliance for education for sustainable development , the crucial role of non-governmental organizations and other major groups was stressed .  
The changes called for - reforming educational systems , rethinking the outcomes of education , developing an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that reflects the complexity of the notion of sustainable development , agreeing on the key messages , changing attitude , lifestyles , and so on - will require time and the concerted effort and support of all sectors of society .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
In addition , it is often argued that minimum wages in developing countries are distortionary , because they are set too high relative to the average income , thus raising production costs in the formal sector and discouraging employment .  
Moreover , family allowances are not common in developing countries , unemployment insurance rarely exists , and social security contributions are generally lower than in OECD countries . 7 Therefore , while some parts of the labour market regulations in developing countries are no longer compatible with today 's economic situation , whether or not there is a need for reform has to be ascertained from a specific examination of the empirical evidence . 
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
One such initiative was the establishment of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples , which had recommended that aboriginal women should be specifically included in any process to define the powers of aboriginal governments and should be assured of full and equal participation in decision-making bodies responsible for developing and implementing measures to ensure their physical and emotional security . 
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , in particular , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
Finally , while FDI has contributed positively to the economic stability of many developing countries , the increasing importance of international portfolio investment has raised concern about the possible negative effects that such volatile investment could have for the stability of developing economies that are exposed to such flows .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
It requested the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of the phenomena and to include in her next report information on countries and enterprises engaged in the illicit traffic , as well as information on persons killed , maimed or injured in developing countries through this heinous act .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
Since UNCTAD did not have the resources to handle all the legal issues relevant to international trade and trade-related services , it could focus on a number of priority areas such as assisting developing countries in the modernization of trade-related national legislation , organization of educational programmes , preparation of information handbooks on legal aspects of international trade , advising Governments on measures to overcome legal impediments to the use of EDI , disseminating information on legislative reforms on issues such as electronic commerce and trade-related services , and legal assistance to Trade Points .  
ITC and UNCTAD have anticipated this trend , and our cooperation in the area of trade efficiency has been the sine qua non for the effective contribution we have been able to make in a practical , result _ oriented and business _ like fashion for making international trade transactions more efficient , less costly , and therefore more affordable to developing countries and their enterprises .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .  
The primary objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference would be ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular developing countries , to use the applications of space research for economic , social and cultural development .  
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
On the basis of a comprehensive review of the activities of the Programme , the High Commissioner has developed the following policy orientation : the Programme focuses on countries in transition to democracy and less developed countries ; priority consideration is given to programmes addressing mandates emanating from the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action and from resolutions of United Nations organs , such as strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights , the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights , developing national plans of action , and building national institutions .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Encourages further technical , educational and economic cooperation among States , in coordination with the United Nations Children 's Fund , other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , towards the development of human resources by nurturing the talents and potentials of children with disabilities , the development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and know-how , and the development of common standards for the national evaluation of childhood disability , with due regard for the situation of poor or developing countries ;  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking on behalf of the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
States should cooperate in facilitating more rational and equitable international economic relations and in encouraging structural changes in the context of a balanced economy in harmony with the needs and interests of all countries , especially developing countries , and should take appropriate measures to this end .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
As a result , the underlying concept of " Vienna " was that concerted governmental action at both international and national levels was required in order to build up endogenous capacities within developing countries .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in those areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , particularly in developing countries .  
Further action at the international level includes recent decisions of the UNEP Governing Council and of IFCS at its second session to prepare for the expeditious conclusion of conventions on prior informed consent and persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) , bearing in mind the need for a comprehensive approach to the control of such pollutants , including necessary international mechanisms to assist developing countries and economies in transition in implementing such conventions .  
External assistance for the building of requisite infrastructure and national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Unpaid work in the household and in agriculture , and volunteer work should be measured and valued using improved methods including regular time-use studies , and international organizations and research institutions should provide technical assistance to developing countries in valuing and making visible women 's unpaid work . 
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Considers that it is necessary , within the ongoing process of the restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights , to take urgent , concrete and immediate steps to change the prevailing distribution of posts of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights in favour of an equitable geographical distribution of those posts in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter , particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries , including to key posts ;  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Global Knowledge 97 will address a fundamental challenge facing developing countries and the international development community in the information age : given the vital role of knowledge in economic and social development , how can developing countries , and in particular the worlds poor , harness knowledge for development , participate in the global information economy and gain access to new tools for life-long learning ?  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
The documentation received from the Economic and Social Council and its bodies is of great interest to World YWCA and is shared as appropriate with newly developing and member national associations in 95 countries through specific correspondence , general mailings of reproduced United Nations information / publications , the monthly publication Advocacy and Briefing Notes and quarterly publications with more extensive coverage of selected issues .  
In view of Egypt 's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation , we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti , and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors , namely , elections , economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Invites States , intergovernmental organizations and all those participating in the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to provide technical and financial assistance , including national capacity-building , to developing countries to support global and regional observation systems and research , including the dissemination of data on El Ni �� , to prevent , mitigate and redress the negative effects of the phenomenon ;  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , including bilateral cooperation , to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport , and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries , and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
The topics discussed included the varying experiences of world regions regarding mortality , epidemiological and health transitions ; the problems faced in measuring mortality levels and mortality by cause of death , particularly in developing countries ; the various approaches to the measurement of health status and their limitations ; the health and mortality situation in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries ; and the relevance of risk factors underlying major causes of death for the formulation of health interventions .  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
He called on the international community to take effective measures to remove the root causes of hegemonism , the inequitable international economic order , the widening gap between rich and poor countries , and war , poverty and discrimination ; to end the neglect of economic , social and cultural rights , which were of concern to developing countries ; and to implement the long-delayed right to development .  
The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Loss of experienced personnel and skilled labour , declines in productivity , the need for increased resources to hire and retrain replacements , increased absenteeism and labour turnover , increased health-care costs , coupled with the human and social costs endured by the individuals and communities affected by the pandemic are imposing heavy burdens , particularly on developing countries with limited resources .  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites the Commission on Sustainable Development , the United Nations Environment Programme and other relevant United Nations bodies , funds and programmes , and the World Tourism Organization , to urgently develop strategies with existing national , regional and subregional tourism organizations in small island developing States to further facilitate sustainable tourism development as an essential element towards an action-oriented international programme of work on sustainable tourism ;  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
The conferences , held in South Africa , focused on reorganizing the judiciary ; adopting a bill of rights ; developing affirmative action programmes ; designing a nationwide public defender service ; comparing institutional models for enforcing a constitutional guarantee of gender equality , and evaluating electoral systems .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
This is achieved by analysing and understanding the key elements of international transactions , including the relevant elimination of constraints ; developing methods to facilitate transactions , including the relevant use of information technologies ; promoting both the use of these methods and associated best practices through channels such as governmental , industry and service associations ; coordinating and integrating the work under the subprogramme with other international organizations ; and securing coherence by cooperating with other interested parties in recognition that the work has broad application in the areas beyond global commerce .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
Although , in the Declaration adopted by the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore , Ministers rejected the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes and agreed that the comparative advantage of countries , particularly low-wage developing countries , must in no way be put into question , the continuing calls for higher labour , social and environmental standards are seen by many in developing countries as a way of promoting new and disguised forms of protectionism .  
These conflicting perceptions and the underlying policy dilemmas could be reconciled better in the context of a more comprehensive and global policy dialogue designed to promote coherent policies in all countries for more balanced growth and development and to reduce unemployment in developed and developing countries . 
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
The Presidents reached agreement on the main tasks for further developing and deepening Russian-Ukrainian ties , and stated that the paramount task was to ensure the practical implementation of the provisions of the new general political Treaty signed during the visit .  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
IS3.18 Requirements of $ 33,500 , reflecting a reduction of $ 22,600 , would cover travel for promotional and representational activities with respect to establishing cooperation with national postal administrations , maintaining contact with international and national philatelic organizations , developing new sources for the distribution of United Nations postage stamps , representation at major international philatelic shows and for coordination meetings of the activities of the three offices .  
Moreover , the major donors stated in 1995 that the role of external partners is to help strengthen capacities in developing partner countries , and that the dominant conception of the mission of development assistance is to help countries and societies to strengthen their economic , human , social and institutional capacities for self-sustaining development .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
As in most developed-country markets , there are regulations which specify the types of packs that are acceptable and the information that labels must contain , and health regulations which are often justified both in terms of hygienic conditions and the use of harmful chemical additives , pesticides and fertilizers , but which can be so complicated and restrictive that they act as barriers for developing country suppliers .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
In the area of reproductive health and family planning , the Population Division of ESCAP has initiated a regional project to strengthen monitoring and information systems to provide accurate and timely indicators and has been assisting Governments in developing and strengthening policies for involving the elderly in social and economic development .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries to improve energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ; "  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
Members will recall that , on the occasion of that historic event , the debate about our common future was often polarized into the choice between rural sustainability and urban migration , between the green agenda and the brown agenda , between developed and developing economies .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
We need solutions that can be attained only with deep and enlightened research and that are based on scientific fact , solutions that aim to be balanced and that take into consideration the international economic system and the interests of the economies of the developing countries in particular .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
Given the extent of violations of the right to a healthy environment , the international community expressed its profound concern , at the 1992 Earth Summit , noting that some international movements of toxic wastes were in contravention of national legislation and existing international instruments , seriously damaging the environment and public health in all countries , particularly the developing ones .  
The wealthy Powers preferred to embark on an insane and increasingly expensive arms race which geared their economies to military objectives and diverted funds from aid that could have helped the developing countries .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .  
In order to facilitate the review of the progress in the development of transit systems by the above mentioned meeting of governmental experts convened pursuant to paragraph 11 of General Assembly 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD made arrangements , with the financial support of the UNDP , to undertake comprehensive regional and subregional analytical studies which highlighted recent developments on the transit transport sector of land-locked and transit developing countries and made recommendations for future action .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
The Ministers reviewed the activities of CPLP , with special focus on the plan of action of the Executive Secretariat , as approved by the Ministerial Meeting held in New York on 26 September 1996 , and they reaffirmed their confidence in CPLP as a privileged instrument for consolidating , developing and enhancing their common historical ties , on the basis of the shared principles of peace , democracy , social justice and economic progress . 
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
While saluting the efforts of the document 's authors , his delegation considered that it might be possible to make a less rigorous procedure for access to the geostationary orbit available solely to systems intended exclusively to serve the territory of a specific developing country and not to provide an international link , but not to the so-called " paper " satellite systems . 
Whilst the environmental objectives of MEAs have received broad public support , it has been increasingly recognized that MEAs involve important economic and developmental issues , and that compliance costs may differ widely across developed and developing country parties , thus raising issues related to equity .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
The committee has formulated a programme of activities with the following main features : ( a ) coordinating all actions launched at the national level ; ( b ) promoting income-generating projects , housing , education and health programmes and involving women in the process of development ; ( c ) developing an employment scheme taking into account the resources and potentials of the informal sector and the need to provide support to women involved in self-employment activities .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
Where developing countries have been watchful of the cost of incentives and applied them within an outward-oriented approach , microeconomic measures addressing specific supply constraints have helped build supply capabilities which the private sector could not have accomplished as rapidly by itself . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 24 \ x { ffff } .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
COPUOS should play a greater role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , strengthening the international legal order in space , stimulating scientific and technological progress in the developing countries and helping them to share in the spin-off benefits of space technology .  
Recently , many developing countries have abandoned the policy of supporting industrialization by maintaining agricultural prices low across the board and left prices to be determined on the market , expecting that resources would thus be allocated efficiently and market opportunities would be exploited .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
Based on the lessons drawn from those experiences , UNICEF had concentrated its activities , throughout the preparatory process for Habitat II and during the Conference itself , on putting children at the centre of the concerns of Habitat II , identifying poverty as the main cause of ill health in urban children , developing policies that led to a better distribution of the fruits of economic growth , reaffirming housing rights and defending the role of cities in guaranteeing the well-being of their inhabitants and not merely economic growth . 
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .  
He urged the international community to adopt specific measures to stabilize the international economic environment , thereby supporting the developing countries in their efforts to mitigate the political and social costs of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms , rather than simply limiting themselves to the re-establishment of their credit ratings and the liberalization of their markets at all costs .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In view of the limited budgetary resources allocated to development , some sectors had shown a marked interest in broadening the purview of the financial institutions and intergovernmental organizations with respect to development issues , which would , in the long run , have the effect of reducing still further the participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process , contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the global dimension which should characterize the solution of the world 's problems .  
With regard to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , the developed countries were apparently unable to fulfil their commitments regarding emissions of greenhouse gases within the agreed time limit , and the situation in developing countries , considering their limited technical and technological capabilities , was likely to be the same .  
Other activities included working jointly with the World Bank on ( a ) a revised and updated Glossary of the legal and economic terms fundamental to competition law and policy ( to be published in 1997 ) , an earlier version of which has been translated into several languages , including Russian and Spanish ; and ( b ) a Competition Manual for transition and developing countries ( to be published in 1997 ) .  
Up to 40 missions to Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request and in cooperation with United Nations agencies and regional commissions , related to formulation of strategies that promote sustainable development , including financing of sustainable development , use of economic instruments and building relevant institutional capacities , including for monitoring and assessment , as well as related to the management of mineral , water and energy resources ; ( ii ) Training . 
While it was currently agreed that economic globalization and the laws of the market had become the new rules of the game , the conditions in which the game was played were far from equitable and had aggravated the economic disparities between developed and developing countries .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
Since debt problems varied considerably from country to country , debt relief measures needed to be adapted to the needs of each case ; to that end , through an evolving debt strategy , the international financial community had contributed significantly to the introduction of improvements in developing countries based on sound economic policies and programmes of adjustment and reform .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
Despite the political and economic development achieved at the regional and international levels , the establishment of economic groupings and the expansion of free trade , there had been an increase in poverty , diseases and illiteracy resulting in a deterioration in the standards of living of developing countries .  Moreover , economic barriers continued to be erected against developing countries .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
She hoped , however , that the international community would not limit its efforts to the application of that initiative but would also propose solutions that were suitable to the developing countries , especially the least developed ones , so that they could use their national financial resources to undertake economic reforms that were vital for their development .  85 .  Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .  
Other critical factors needed for effective dialogue include : ensuring the promotion of an entrepreneurial culture in developing countries in general ; addressing ideological resistance to the transition from a command economy to a market economy ; and putting in place measures which foster the integration of informal sector enterprises into the formal sector of the economy .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
The objective of the colloquium was to draw upon the real experiences of high-level executives from developed , developing and transitional economies , in order to extract comparative lessons on impediments to successful public-private partnerships worldwide .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
The difficulties faced by developing countries in seeking access to trade , labour and finance flows were exacerbated by protectionist barriers raised by the advanced countries because of the unfounded fear that globalization was one of the major causes of the high unemployment rate and growing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled labour . 
Co-operate in developing at the national and , where appropriate , regional level , systematic observation and data archives , scientific and technical research , and support for improving endogenous capacities and capabilities to participate in international and intergovernmental programmes , conferences , meetings and seminars related to the climate system , and the enhancement of access to , and exchange of , data and analyses thereof , obtained from areas beyond national jurisdiction , taking into account the particular concerns and needs of developing country Parties in implementing Article 5 of the Convention .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
Iraq is a developing country that is suffering greatly as a result of the coercive economic policies and measures exemplified in the complete economic embargo imposed on it more than seven years ago that affect the health of the Iraqi people and every aspect of its economic , social and cultural life .  
On the contrary , the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela has expressed in numerous statements its categorical repudiation of unilateral coercive acts that adversely affect the economies of developing countries , on the ground that such acts contravene the basic principles of coexistence and international economic cooperation and the world consensus regarding the need for a non-discriminatory and open trading system .  
The concept of coercive economic measures embraces a variety of issues related to : ( a ) identification of essential elements , distinctive features and limitations of a definition of such measures ; ( b ) specification and classification of motives and policy objectives of sender States in resorting to economic coercion against target States , in particular developing countries ; and ( c ) categorization or selection of specific types of relevant measures , as well as analysis of their anticipated and actual effects .  
It recommended that analytical and conceptual work be carried out both at the specialized level ( e.g . , through continued efforts for developing methodologies and criteria for impact assessment ) and on an interdisciplinary scale ( i.e . , interrelationship between the political , legal , economic and social dimensions of the problem ) .  
National coordinating agencies will receive guidance and advice in mobilizing private-sector investment , conducting feasibility studies , developing marketing strategies , identifying effective credit schemes , organizing international round tables , negotiating debt swaps and assisting national authorities seeking extensions or enlargement of current international preferential trade arrangements for selected Andean exports . 
This set of activities also includes acquisition and distribution of reference samples of drugs under international control , their metabolites and of controlled chemicals and precursors to national laboratories in developing countries , drug-testing laboratories participating in the international collaborative exercises , regional training centres and collaborating institutions ; production and distribution of drug and precursor identification kits to law enforcement agencies ; and organization of expert group meetings on laboratory methodologies and standard guidelines .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
But for many developing country enterprises , quite the opposite may also be true : exposed to international competition , or to domestic competition from firms established with the help of FDI , they may be unable to compete .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
On the eve of the new millennium , I am still quite dissatisfied with the level of attention the world community is paying to the severe economic , environmental and potential political problems that threaten small island developing States .  
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
Intensified cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is essential for an effective , vibrant , modern and reformed United Nations which is responsive to the concerns of the vast majority of its Members the developing countries .  
Although foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have been increasing , the opposite has been the case with Africa , where even the little that has been directed to the continent has been decreasing over the years .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .  
For Malaysia , as a developing country , economic , social and cultural rights , articulated through the larger framework of the right to development , are as important as civil and political rights .  
From the time Kyrgyzstan became independent , we have pursued a policy of developing and strengthening broad regional and international cooperation in specific areas , including the control of narcotic drugs .  
He hoped that the international community would assist Equatorial Guinea in the task of developing civil , political , economic and social rights , which were indispensable if democracy was to be strengthened .  
A whole range of interrelated factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature contribute to the emergence and development of the movement of toxic wastes and dangerous products between the industrialized and the developing countries .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , smaller countries and developing countries may never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
In addition , the formulation of national plans and their implementation would help create a favourable social , economic , political , health , educational and family environment for children , in both developed and developing countries .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
Given the demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce as a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
These institutions succeeded where traditional public programmes failed , and she supported UNCTADs initiative aimed at creating an essential direct link between private investors and micro finance institutions in developing countries . 
The recent increase in mineral investment in developing economies provides an opportunity to develop creative partnerships at the local level to integrate mine development into a wider regional strategy for improving economic and social conditions .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The variables were standardized and equal weights assigned to them in the computation of the composite vulnerability index , which confirmed that small island developing States were generally more vulnerable than larger countries . 
Partnerships between the public and private sectors , which are becoming common in many developing countries , ensure that essential skills and theory acquired through formal education are complemented by enterprise-based practical training .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
Such assistance represented 8.4 per cent of its gross national product , one of the highest rates in the world , and reflected its concern to raise the standard of living of the developing countries by helping to strengthen their economic infrastructure .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
He urged the international community to increase direct foreign investment , especially in Africa , as it was insufficient despite the structural adjustment programmes undertaken by the developing countries in order to create a favourable economic environment . 
To date over 80 bilateral agreements covering the economic , trade , scientific , industrial , technical and environmental fields had been signed with developing countries and countries in transition .  
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
With the encroachment of agriculture on natural or quasi-natural ecosystems , plant and animal genetic resources are being lost , modern cultivars are replacing local ones and intensive livestock production systems are developing .  
The experiences of small island developing States to date suggest that institutional and administrative capacity-building is a protracted and complex process that requires sustained political commitment and sufficient resources .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
Further , widespread discrimination based on gender , ethnicity and religious belief is reported daily and extreme poverty and marginalization is the fate of many in both developing and developed countries .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
However , the unique demographic , economic and geographic constraints faced by small island developing States call for a strengthening of the concerted efforts at human resource development .  
Given demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce to be a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
AOUIJ said that , although the extent to which political power was shared between women and men in Denmark constituted a model for developing and developed countries alike , economic power was not shared to the same extent .  
In developing a national legislation , it has been found convenient to first construct an umbrella or a framework environmental law which lays down the basic legal principles without attempting to codify all relevant statutory provisions .  
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
In adopting its agreed conclusions on the subject in 1995 , the Council took a major step forward by providing a coherent set of guidelines for developing a coordinated response to this global agenda at the intergovernmental as well as the inter-agency level .  
Pursuant to various legislative mandates , the United Nations Programme in Public Administration and Finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The other half include mainly fuels , minerals , wood , other basic commodities and intermediate inputs required by industry , as well as certain tropical and fishery products of substantial export interest to a wide range of developing countries .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Tax administrators from developing and transitional economy countries encounter considerable difficulties in understanding the controversial taxation issues involved in , for example , transfer pricing mechanisms and innovative financial instruments .  
With rising worldwide demand for mobile satellite services , especially in developing countries , which often lack an adequate terrestrial telephone line infrastructure , planned LEO and MEO systems will supplement GEO satellite communications services .  
A new multimedia central editorial board will be established , with the objective of developing and maintaining a timely and more effective news gathering and delivery capacity , tied as much as possible to the global daily news cycle .  
His delegation believed that two factors were essential for that revitalization , namely , the adoption by developing countries of sound , sustained internal policies and the existence of a favourable global economic environment .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
He remarked that urgent measures should be taken to erase the external debts of the developing countries , many of which were so crippled by debt servicing that they were unable to provide basic economic and social services .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
In addition to the more obvious manifestations , developing countries practised more subtle forms of racial discrimination through immigration laws based on ethnic and regional considerations .  
Principle 11 of the Rio Declaration stated that environmental standards applied by some countries might be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries , in particular developing countries .  
We also believe that countries with sophisticated and effective early warning systems have a crucial role to play in providing adequate and timely information to allow developing countries to prepare for impending disasters .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
However , the implications of that approach as it applied to economic , social and cultural rights , development and the sharing of obligations at the national and international levels were less evident , particularly in the case of developing countries .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
Thirdly , rather than providing temporary services for the poor , the main objective of IFAD is to develop viable and financially sustainable rural financial systems , especially for the very poor living in remote areas in many developing countries .  
All staff with supervisory / managerial responsibilities are required to have additional goals that relate to managing human and financial resources ; leading , motivating and developing staff ; and demonstrating gender and cross-cultural responsiveness ;  
One expert from a developing country which had announced the introduction of a GSP for LDCs raised the question of the proper legal accommodation under WTO rules for autonomous preferential market access for LDCs .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
In parallel , the system of international cooperation must be strengthened in order to transfer the financial , technological and scientific resources of the most highly developed economies to the developing countries .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
It was also stated that for a number of developing countries there was still a crucial need for continued ODA flows since the current levels of trade and foreign investment could not provide for their essential needs , including basic infrastructure .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
Information received from a number of regional institutions indicate , however , that they are still unable to meet the technical assistance needs of small island developing States in their respective regions on account of a number of constraints , which are briefly outlined in section III below .  
Although the prime responsibility for the execution of regional programmes and projects rests with small island developing States Governments , in view of the meagre resources of individual small island developing States and the high costs of regional programmes there is an obvious need for adequate financial support from the international community for timely and effective implementation of regional programmes .  
The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
However , despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of developing countries , including Mozambique , had implemented structural adjustment programmes , liberalized their economies and undertaken other reforms which had had serious social consequences , financial resource flows had diminished , resulting in a vicious circle of economic stagnation and financial crisis .  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
To that end , international cooperation would have to be intensified by improving trade relations and access to markets , sharing new technologies , creating a favourable international financial and economic order and allocating increased development resources to developing countries .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
Mr . Beti ( Observer for Switzerland ) said that the area of activity of UNITAR was training and institutional capacity-building , which consisted of assisting developing countries and countries in transition to better understand international issues such as negotiation , the peaceful settlement of disputes , modern information and communications technologies , environmental development or sound financial management .  
The Preparatory Conference established the following general objectives : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Future efforts by international organizations , multilateral institutions and instruments should be flexible in order to accommodate existing and emerging needs , as well as the different levels of social and economic development of countries , in particular developing countries .  
Most developing countries encounter enormous difficulties in providing timely responses to the demands and to implement the substantive objectives of most instruments and conventions and in putting into practice their compliance requirements , due to their limited institutional and financial capacity , lack of manpower and managerial skills and inadequate or non-enforced national legislative frameworks to support these instruments .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
Urge developed countries and relevant organizations to review their international assistance in forestry to improve institutional capacities of developing countries , to base their assistance on the priorities identified in the national forest programmes of recipient countries , to increase effectiveness of available resources , and to increase their ODA contributions ;  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
The executive boards had accomplished a great deal in the area of funding strategies , but much remained to be done in order to ensure predictable , assured funding of activities within the United Nations mandate and of efforts to achieve the ambitious goals set at United Nations conferences and to meet the needs of developing countries .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
Meanwhile , we must let the rest of the world understand the real nature of this conflict - that this is not just another internal conflict in some small and distant developing country , but an armed rebellion , externally inspired and maintained , against the people of Sierra Leone and their democratically elected Government .  
Affirms that international cooperation is acknowledged more than ever as a necessity deriving from recognized mutual interest and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52 / 12 B ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to efforts to eradicate poverty and that this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation , measures to ensure food security , the provision of better education , greater utilization of appropriate technology , fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment and increased productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
The developing countries difficult situation was further compounded by their lack of technological capabilities , since commodities were becoming less important ( particularly in view of the growing use of manufactured products ) , trade preferences were being eliminated and a new trend had arisen in the commodities futures markets and was threatening to destabilize the earnings of countries dependent on such goods . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
UNIDO , with its capacity to carry out objective and independent studies of the global , regional , national and sectoral issues that affected industrial development , could provide the developing countries with valuable sources of information and advice in that area .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Turning to the question of trade and development , he said that , while trade liberalization was expected to bring about a considerable increase in global income , it must be recognized that , since the early 1970s , the least developed countries had suffered a cumulative decline of 50 per cent in their terms of trade , while the developing countries as a whole had lost $ 290-billion between 1981 and 1991 , which could be attributed to the decline in commodities prices . 
While the developing countries had utilized their own resources in order to achieve the basic objective of sustainable development , it was clear that those efforts would be inadequate without substantial support from the international community .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
In concluding his presentation to the Committee , Mr . Otunnu pointed out that his programme of work for 1999 involved a series of initiatives at the country , regional and international levels which focused on developing public advocacy , strengthening international standards and local values , establishing concrete initiatives in the midst of ongoing conflict , and mobilizing concerted responses to post-conflict needs .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements .  
The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 10 above and given the urgent need to foster closer cooperation between Governments , United Nations bodies and other international organizations , international financial institutions , in particular the World Bank and the IMF , and non _ governmental organizations on an issue of critical importance to developing countries , particularly least developed and heavily indebted poor countries , the participants agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights :  
In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
In the state policy document on demography and the national programme on improving the status of women , there have been put forward a cluster of objectives to pursue activities aimed at supporting the family well-being , developing a Mongolian family and household study , passing on to the younger generation respect for national traditions , preserving the genetic pool of Mongolians , and preparing children for future independent life , labour , and equal participation of men and women in family .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
It was agreed that the informal consultations between the focal points of small island developing States and prospective donors represented in New York that had been initiated prior to the meeting should continue with a view to discussing the issues raised during the meeting .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
Convinced that the magnitude of current difficulties called for additional measures for resolving the debt problems of the developing countries , Norway had launched a new national strategy which , in addition to supporting and strengthening already existing multilateral schemes , included bilateral debt reduction measures that would be implemented over and above the reductions granted under multilateral operations .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
Since Africa continued to suffer from a heavy external debt burden that contributed to the increase in poverty and affected the political and social sectors , SADC reiterated its call for urgent , effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the problems of external debt and debt servicing in the developing countries .  
To reduce the armaments of others whilst keeping one 's own intact , to reduce the obsolete while developing the state _ of _ the _ art , or even to sacrifice the security of others for one 's own security and to require other countries to scrupulously abide by treaties while giving oneself freedom of action by placing domestic laws above international law : such double standards make a mockery of international disarmament efforts and run counter to the fundamental purposes and objectives of disarmament .  
The 1997 Task Force reported that substantial problems have arisen as a result , and recommended that information centre staff become a communications services group under the resident coordinator , who would be responsible to the head of the Department for developing a plan for how the United Nations global themes can best be adapted and articulated locally ( see report of the Task Force ) .  
With respect to objective No . 2 , namely to attain greater efficiency in international trade and development , particularly that of developing countries , in accordance with national aims of economic and social development and existing economic structures , such as through ( a ) the creation , encouragement and protection of competition ; ( b ) control of concentration of market power ; ( c ) encouragement of innovation , the results have been mixed during the period under review .  
This quite simple backbone or table of contents of issues to consider when drafting a competition law is then complemented in Part II of the Model Law with detailed commentary to the articles , in which a review is made of actual laws in both developed and developing countries , as well as countries in transition , with a view to determining the most recent trends and views on how best to treat each one of the issues considered in the elements for articles of the law contained in Part I .  
The Set also provides for work aimed at achieving common approaches in national policies relating to RBPs compatible with the Set ( article F . 1 ) , and continued work on the elaboration of a model law or laws on RBPs in order to assist developing countries in devising appropriate legislation ( article F . 2 ) ; the OECD instruments do not have such provisions , but the 1998 OECD recommendation recommends convergence in ( as well as effective enforcement of ) laws prohibiting hardcore cartels .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
In addition , in paragraph 25 , the Assembly expressed concern over continued high rates of self-revision during peak workload periods and occasional inadequate translations , which had sometimes hampered the work of delegations , and emphasized the importance of continuous training for all translators at all duty stations and of developing measures to provide translators with increased support from submitting offices and secretariats .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
In the face of acute budgetary constraints in many developing countries and transition economies , intensified by the worldwide financial crisis , efforts to improve financing of the social sector must be seen in the perspective of a host of competing claims upon national treasuries . 
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
It was reported that the average spread on new international bond issues by developing countries ( against United States Treasury bonds of comparable final maturity and coupon ) fell from 355 basis points in 1994 to 258 basis points in the first eight months of 1997 [ 15 ] .  
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
Emphasis will be placed on improving the capacity of the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to integrate them more fully into the regions dynamic development and enhance their participation in international development in the economic and social fields .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
South / South cooperation , including TCDC and ECDC , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their more effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system .  
National and bilateral TCDC activities during the reporting period clearly indicate that an increasing number of developing countries are emerging as key proponents of the TCDC process , assuming leadership roles in promoting , organizing and funding bilateral and regional TCDC-related projects as part of their annual commitment to trade , investment and international cooperation activities .  
Among the various configurations of South / South cooperation , the evidence gathered for this report provides incontestable proof that the specific modality of technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) has not only remained in widespread use but has continued to grow in popularity and application among developing country partners .  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .  
In the case of TCDC activities outside the system - i.e . , projects that are initiated , funded and executed in a spontaneous manner between bilateral partners - a parallel increase in the number of participating or beneficiary countries appears to reflect directly the steady improvement of the technical capabilities and funding resources of a growing number of developing countries willing to share their experiences with others .  
The right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , and expresses deep concern about the number of children living below these standards and infant and child mortality due to preventable diseases , all over the world , in particular in the developing countries ;  
Requests the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the Conference and the participation of non _ governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requests all Governments , international organizations , non _ governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to this Fund ;  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
Declares that advisory services and technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments with a view to developing national capacities in the field of human rights constitute one of the most efficient and effective means of promoting and protecting all human rights , democracy and the rule of law ;  
Noting the expansion of the technical cooperation programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , extended upon the request of the concerned Member States , and the crucial importance of sharing information and experiences and developing and strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights ,  
Technical and economic cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC / ECDC ) facilitated increased South-South sharing of capacities through the development and dissemination of 250 best practices in good governance , structural adjustment , poverty eradication , micro-financing , maternal mortality , agriculture and food security , science and technology for sustainable human development , job creation and management of the environment and the sustainable development of small island states . 
UNDP support focused on developing the necessary institutional capacities and human resources while the World Bank / GEF provided technical support to stabilizing the environment and improving the management of international waters .  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
Affirms that international cooperation is acknowledged more than ever as a necessity deriving from recognized mutual interest , and therefore that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
Invites States , United Nations organs , programmes and specialized agencies and international and non-governmental organizations to assist developing countries , in particular the least developed countries and those in Africa , in their efforts to prevent the spread of the epidemic and alleviate and control the detrimental impact of HIV / AIDS on the human rights of their populations ;  
Declares that advisory services and technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments with a view to developing national capacities in the field of human rights constitute one of the most efficient and effective means of promoting and protecting all human rights and democracy ;  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Noting the expansion of the technical cooperation programme of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , extended upon the request of the concerned Member States , and the crucial importance of sharing information and experiences and developing and strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights ,  
Declares that advisory services and technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments with a view to developing national capacities in the field of human rights constitute one of the most efficient and effective means of promoting and protecting all human rights , democracy and the rule of law ;

To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
The recent United Nations global conferences have stressed that strong public institutions , efficient public administration systems and a competent civil service are essential for the development efforts of developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Under the overall objective of assisting developing countries to address emerging challenges and persistent problems , the objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of research institutions in developing countries to conduct development policy analysis , particularly in the examination of changes in domestic economic conditions and of regional and international developments that have a bearing on them .  
Enhance the capacity of institutions in developing countries to formulate development strategies by strengthening their ability to monitor national subregional , regional and international macroeconomic trends and incorporate them into the national framework for economic and social policy-making ;  
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
Many delegations believed that modern information technology and a transparent information network were key to progress and development , and were keenly aware that the gulf between developed and developing countries in the global information network remained wide . 
Also , many speakers , while supporting the use of advanced technologies , including the Internet , stressed that this should not be done at the expense of traditional means of communication , such as radio , which continued to be the main source of information in most developing countries .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
In this way national participation in the most advanced scientific activities can be assured and nationals of developing countries can become an active and integral part of the important group of internationally recognized and competitive associations of researchers in many fields .  
While developing countries that have received large foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other capital inflows have achieved high growth , they have also been subject to extreme downside risks of volatile capital movements .  
In this regard , progress has been made in many developing countries where public spending on education and health has increased against a background of fiscal adjustment under IMF-supported programmes . 11 At the same time , unproductive public expenditure , such as excessive military spending , should be avoided or reduced ; 
Encouraging longer-term capital flows to a large number of developing countries to support development objectives with the ultimate goal of the eradication of absolute poverty , mainly through improved access to productive employment and basic services , and integrating the social dimensions of development into policy objectives in the new international financial architecture .

Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
We also finance the operating subsidy of the RMS St . Helena , at present the sole regular means of physical access to the island ( an examination of the economic feasibility of developing an eventual air link is currently under way , alongside our discussions with the United States Government about opening up Wideawake Airfield on Ascension to civilian charter flights ) .  
To set up a voluntary fund designed to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund ;  
In late 1998 , the firm Veng S.A . was set up with the aim of developing new-generation space vehicles through unconventional mechanisms of financing by the private sector and scientific and technological bodies .  
She had also stressed the need to take into account the rapid growth of the female labour force in developing countries and to protect workers in the informal sector , most of whom were women , and had argued that the Governments of developing countries should move slowly in adopting policies for economic liberalization , which reduced the demand for unskilled female workers .  
While non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) were a driving force for social development , the steady increase in poverty among the hard core poor and the growing disparity in levels of consumption indicated that the poorest sectors could be better addressed by community-based organizations capable of developing innovative programmes that took into account the non-static characteristics of poverty .  
Encourages developing countries that have not yet done so to establish national focal points for technical cooperation among developing countries and , where focal points have already been established , to ensure their effective and efficient functioning ;  
Stresses that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance , as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy , and that it is not a substitute for but rather is complementary to North-South cooperation ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
There is also a steady increase in the number of developing country member States reporting that suitable domestic conditions exist for the management and operationalization of TCDC programmes , namely , an effective domestic focal point mechanism ; elucidation of a clear national policy for TCDC ; and an established approach to funding TCDC activities .  
It is essential that this future body , whose governing board will comprise the various sectors of civil society involved and whose role will be of key importance in developing space sciences within the country and in familiarizing coming generations with the issues of sustainable socio-economic development , should be strengthened as from its establishment through the cooperation of Member States .

The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
There has been a dramatic but uneven increase in the flow of private capital , particularly equity capital , to developing countries . 11 In order to alleviate the balance-of-payment and debt problems and to increase income , many developing countries have adopted investor friendly policies such as low or no corporate taxes , tax holidays , subsidies to investors , and privatization . 
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
It had set the basis for a forward-looking organization that is flexible , innovative and proactive , able to implement policies and programmes effectively around shared goals , transparent and accountable in its dealings with donors , developing countries and people around the world , and equipped for fruitful partnerships with the rest of the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
There is also a steady increase in the number of developing country member States reporting that suitable domestic conditions exist for the management and operationalization of TCDC programmes , namely , an effective domestic focal point mechanism ; elucidation of a clear national policy for TCDC ; and an established approach to funding TCDC activities .  
He stated that TCDC and economic cooperation among developing countries ( ECDC ) provide the framework for and reflect the continuing commitment of the developing countries to strengthen their solidarity for the dual purpose of supporting their national development efforts and enabling their effective participation in the international economic system .  
In terms of the increased role of services in the structure of the global economy , he observed that there was enormous development potential and developing countries must secure their place in this growing area .  
It was agreed that the Bureau would consult with representatives of Member States in New York on the theme proposed by the Group of 77 and China entitled " The role of technical cooperation among developing countries in science and technology for development " and that a final decision based on those consultations would be communicated to the Member States well ahead of the twelfth session so that delegations may take suitable preparatory actions .  
Reaffirms the great potential of technical cooperation among developing countries , which has now gained widespread acceptance as an innovative and effective instrument of technical cooperation , and urges developing countries to further continue to elaborate national policies and strategies for technical cooperation among developing countries so as to give full effect to this form of cooperation ;

Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the twelfth session , as approved at the eleventh session , taking fully into account the results of the eleventh session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
These included policy , legal and regulatory frameworks for sustained development of mineral resources best practices ; transnational corporations contribution in the mining and energy sectors ; new resources of capital for the development of Africas mineral resources : tapping capital markets ; and alternative approaches to financing energy and power development : case studies from African and other developing regions .  
The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
The world economy was growing well below its potential , a large number of developing countries were stagnant or had a declining GDP , prices of many primary commodities were at unusually low levels , social conditions in crisis countries had suffered serious setbacks , and downside risks were substantial .  
Several Ministers stated that , while developing countries were generally encouraged by recent broad proposals on functioning of international financial markets and financing for development , they were concerned about the design of the initiatives to give effect to such proposals .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Relaxation of foreign exchange regulations has removed some important obstacles to transit trade , also enabling private sector transport operators in many landlocked and transit developing countries to retain some hard currency for purchase of spare parts and equipment .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
Promote and facilitate integrated island management programmes , including economic and legal instruments , administrative structures and management procedures , for the improved protection and use of the resources of small island developing States , encompassing the totality of the terrestrial environment , coastline and adjacent exclusive economic zones ;  
Strengthen and expand research , monitoring and assessment activities addressed to small island developing States , including the social and economic factors affecting their terrestrial and aquatic environment , as well as relevant information for the development of a vulnerability index for small island developing States , including the potential impacts of climate change ;  
Improved coordination among the national and international institutions charged with developing and encouraging the adoption of policies and measures to meet human needs , without undermining the environmental foundation for development ;  
UNDPs second country programme for St . Helena ( 19931996 ) focused on developing national capacities in two areas : ( a ) sustainable livelihoods ; and ( b ) ensuring social protection throughout the transition from an aid-dependent economy dominated by the public sector to a self-financing economy , in which the private sector has an expanded role .  
This is one of the most rapidly progressing and developing national sectors and signifies a major extension of satellite communication coverage , providing communities with a greater range of local telephone and radio services , which have been used , for example , for communications to and from regions hit by natural disasters , with a consequent improvement in the utilization of the resources assigned to disaster management .  
Countries today , especially developing countries , need to be capable of assimilating technological progress through an understanding of the present and its projection into the future , by formulating appropriate strategies to close the technology gap with the more advanced nations and thus avoid being overtaken by events .  
In their initial discussion , the Group of Experts referred to the need to provide technical training for tax administrators from developing and transitional economy countries in transfer pricing methodologies and techniques , and also referred to the issue of improving tax collections from multinational corporations and the implementation of effective mutual agreement and exchange of information procedures for all countries . 
The Group of Experts was aware that an efficient and effective revenue administration can help developing countries and transitional economies to mobilize additional revenue resources and achieve greater financial self-reliance in facilitating and achieving sustainable economic development .  
It has had the objective of reducing through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural hazards , including earthquakes , tropical cyclones and other storms , tsunamis , floods , landslides , volcanic activity , wildfires , locust and similar infestations , drought and desertification , and other calamities of natural origin .  
Small island developing States are threatened to a similar degree , but due to their physical isolation and limited economic base are often dependent on a single industry , such as tourism .  
Providing support to develop coherent field-based humanitarian strategies , credible and successful consolidated appeals , developing a strategic monitoring capacity that supports resource mobilization efforts of the Emergency Relief Coordinator and strengthens the United Nations system accountability in complex emergencies and leading this process and focusing on management of all aspects related to the consolidated appeals process cycle ;  
The main aim of IATA , the global airline trade association with a membership of 257 carriers , of which 18 are based in landlocked developing countries is to promote safe , reliable and secure services and to develop collaboration among airlines and cooperation with ICAO . 
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without adequate support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest .  
Being a developing country with a vast territory , a varied topography , a large population and a weak economic foundation , China is confronted with a tremendous challenge of modernization and construction , and space technology , as one of the most sophisticated technologies in the contemporary world , is not only a representation of the overall national strength , but also an important means to transcend the phase of traditional development and accelerate economic and social development .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
The Governments assembled in Rome declared that they considered it intolerable and unacceptable that more than 800-million people throughout the world , particularly in developing countries , did not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs .  
While on the one hand every Government should remove obstacles blocking development within its State , such as failure to observe civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , effective international cooperation is essential in providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development , in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
The primary goals of the Conference were to agree on an approach to development that would protect the environment while ensuring economic development , and to lay the foundation for a global partnership between the developing and the more industrialized countries , based on mutual needs and common interests , to ensure a healthy future for the planet .  
With regard to the issues of poverty , economic development and environment , we note with regret that the draft document failed to address the crucial and urgent need to establish better understanding at the international level , and a high level of international cooperation that will enable the developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular to realize success in these fields .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
The Council may also wish to decide that in developing future multi-year work programmes of individual functional commissions , these programmes should be coordinated with those of other functional commissions in such a manner that the themes and issues that will be considered or have been already decided for consideration by these commissions can be addressed from different perspectives in the same calendar year .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Serving as the departmental focal point for developing and coordinating the implementation of global public information strategies and activities to promote special conferences , United Nations decades , international years and other major events relating to the major thematic areas ;  
Rapid advances in technology , growing awareness of the need to preserve Earth and its environment , the increasing potential offered by space activities for economic and social benefits vis - - vis the urgent needs of the developing countries and the changes in the global political scene during the post-cold-war era are sound reasons to deliberate on the role of space in the development of humanity in the twenty-first century .  
In view of the immense potential of space systems to transform societies through distance education and developmental communications , in particular in the developing world , it would be worthwhile to initiate global efforts to create the required awareness among decision makers as well as to ensure effective and synergetic utilization of various space systems in that regard .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
This revolution is aimed at developing the country 's human resources by ensuring that the education system is relevant and geared to equip students with the requisite knowledge , skills and abilities for sustained , successful living in the twenty-first century .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
On the basis of the Cairo Programme of Action , Benin has developed a strategy we call the common minimum social welfare programme , aimed at improving the quality of life of families and covering a set of basic needs in five essential areas : health , education , food , developing people 's ability to create wealth , and opening up communities . 
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
The central theme of this review that population concerns are an indispensable part of national and international efforts to achieve equitable , sustained development is particularly relevant to small island developing States , such as Jamaica and many in the Caribbean .  
Since the developing countries constitute the majority of the world population , the successful implementation of the international Programme of Action is quite inconceivable if these serious economic and financial difficulties are not overcome and if the international environment , unfavourable for developing countries , is not rectified .  
From this point of view , we believe it imperative for the international community to facilitate the promotion of a supportive economic environment , particularly for developing countries in their effort to eradicate poverty and achieve sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , as agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
Despite the fact that it has slowed in many countries , the current rate of demographic growth will , in the coming decades , have a considerable impact on economic , social and even political stability in numerous developing countries which are already enduring serious difficulties .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
It stresses the importance of sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , acknowledging the responsibility of the developed countries in the international pursuit of sustainable development and continued efforts to promote sustained economic growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that can benefit all countries , especially the developing ones .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
Cuba is aware of the possible dangers attendant upon any use of radioactive waste , which would be tantamount to radiological war , and of the effects of such use on national , regional and international security , and especially the security of the developing countries ; and also of the inherent threat to the preservation of the environment .  
It reports on the ways and means to ensure a better relative balance in the share of technical cooperation activities among the various regions , taking into account their respective needs as well as making maximum use , in the implementation of technical cooperation activities , of existing capacities of developing countries , including local and regional expertise .  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
Reaffirms that untied core resources are the bedrock of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and , in this context , calls on Governments to take steps to address the urgent and immediate need for a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , reflecting the increasing needs of developing countries , taking into account the development of multi-year funding frameworks ;  
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
While there is increasing recognition in most developing countries of the need to use such high technology input in support of sustainable development and of developmental activities , interestingly there are two interrelated issues to be addressed : firstly , promoting the technology itself and the associated problems encountered and , secondly , effective utilization of the high technology knowledge , once acquired , for sustainable development activities .  
Given the lack of educated and trained manpower , international efforts are required to ensure that sufficient opportunities are available to developing countries to build their human resource base in different areas of space technology and its applications ;  
As a result , the allocations and expenditures in connection with developing the national economy have fallen below their pre-embargo levels , leading to poorer economic performance , lower available commodities and services required to meet essential needs and a rise in the price of most commodities and services , producing an inflation rate of over 200 per cent .  
In accordance with the objective of health for all , the State spent tremendous sums of money on the health sector with a view to providing a health service for every male and female citizen , without distinction , and developing health services , medicines and free treatment in line with the latest international scientific developments and in quantities and qualities proportionate to the needs of all citizens .  
In order for UNCTAD to make a strong and effective contribution to the process of economic development and enhanced social welfare in the developing countries , it is essential that there be an integrated approach to policy development , recognizing the interrelationships between competition policy and other facets of economic and social policy .  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
The objectives of UNCTADs technical cooperation activities on competition policy have been pursued with a two-track process that encompasses ( i ) the preparation of a series of briefing papers / notes on key issues / concepts related to competition policy and its development implications ; and ( ii ) informal consensus-building activities in the form of seminars , regional symposiums and other training activities , involving numerous policy makers from developing countries .  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
The programme that the independent expert is proposing in this paper would be based on international cooperation , in the form of a compact between the donor countries of the OECD , the financial institutions and the concerned developing countries , to realize three basic rights - the right to food , the right to primary health care and the right to primary education - within a specified time period .  
It recognizes that sustained action is required to promote rapid development of developing countries , and then declares : as a complement to the efforts of developing countries , effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .  
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Conserving the environment , the advent of the information age and continued exploration of the solar system are just some of the important global issues in relation to which space technology can play a leading role in the coming years and many multilateral mechanisms already exist to promote greater international cooperation , in particular with a view to assisting developing countries .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
While welcoming the many spectacular achievements in outer space and space-related activities , the President drew attention to the numerous social and economic challenges that continued to face humankind , particularly in developing countries .  
All representatives endorsed and welcomed the objectives of the Conference , which included promoting the effective means of using space solutions to address problems of regional or global significance ; strengthening the capabilities of Member States , especially developing countries , to use the results of space research for economic and cultural development ; and enhancing international cooperation in space science and technology and its applications . 
Some representatives pointed out that industry in industrialized countries continued to play an active role in developing both new and innovative space applications and technology geared for markets in services in satellite communications , remote sensing and space transportation .  
The academic community has assisted the United Nations human rights machinery by , among other things , developing two sets of guidelines known as the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( 1986 ) , elaborated in 1997 in the Maastricht guidelines on violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
The meeting held a discussion on economic , social and cultural rights and subsequently recommended that the inter-sessional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights should focus , inter alia , on developing quantifiable benchmarks ; identifying obstacles to the realization of these rights ; and proposing relevant actions to strengthen national capacities for the promotion and protection of these rights .  
What links many of these seemingly disparate issues is an often inchoate , but nevertheless palpable , fear on the part of large numbers of thoughtful people , in developing , and developed countries alike , that impersonal forces beyond their control and accountable to no one - distant bureaucracies , mammoth transnational corporations , international organizations meeting behind closed doors - are taking over their lives .  
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
The rapid liberalization of financial transactions in developing countries without sufficient prudential regulation was an important element in the onset of the current financial and economic crisis .  
UNCTAD 's future work should aim at improving developing countries understanding of the impact of foreign direct investment , through transnational corporations , on international trade , technology flows , enterprise development and their development prospects generally .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .  
At the inter-agency level , ongoing measures to enhance programme complementarity need to be accompanied by a renewed effort at identifying and focusing on common priority objectives and priority themes ; developing joint arrangements to respond to emerging requirements ; and concerting overall policies and strategies . 
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
The Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported that , based on its ongoing projections of production , trade and consumption to the year 2005 , the agricultural exports of developing countries could become more dynamic in the coming period than in the previous decade .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
While the transparency commitments made under the SPS Agreement had improved the flow of information on SPS-related regulations of WTO member countries , an application of country-specific SPS requirements beyond what was recommended as an international standard saddled developing country producers and exporters with additional costs to meet disparate SPS measures on the same product in different markets .  
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
As experienced by some developing countries , the calculated product-specific AMS of a market price support measure could become a negative figure when the administered market price dropped below the ERP nominally fixed to the world price in the 1986-1988 base period to meet the objective of supporting food purchases by poor households . 
The common overall objective among developing countries in the next negotiations , experts agreed , was to maximize the potential benefits to developing countries from the continuation of agricultural reform in the multilateral framework by correcting perceived shortcomings of the current Agreement which seemingly put developing countries at a disadvantage in international agricultural trade .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
Following the World Solar Summit , held at Harare in September 1996 , organized under the guidance of the World Solar Commission , a 10-year programme aimed at the wider use of all sources of environmentally sound , renewable energies , as well as at improving the quality of life , notably in the rural areas of developing countries , was prepared and subsequently approved by the World Solar Commission in June 1997 .  
The first session , devoted to globalization competition and development , reviewed three issues of major importance for developing countries and economies in transition , namely : ( i ) foreign direct ( FDI ) , mergers and alliances ; ( ii ) deregulation , demonopolization and privatization ; and ( iii ) intellectual property rights , competition and transfer of technology .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
The economic benefits of privatization consisted of improving enterprise efficiency and performance ; developing competitive industry ; accessing capital , know-how and markets ; achieving effective corporate governance ; developing well _ functioning capital markets ; and securing an optional sale price .  
The IGE also reviewed UNCTADs technical assistance activities in developing countries and economies in transition in the course of 1998 , and , acting as a preparatory meeting for the fourth review conference , agreed on a provisional agenda for the conference , to be held in September 2000 .  
Accelerating current initiatives and [ taking / adopting United States ] additional actions to reduce substantially the debts of [ developing countries , particularly United States would delete ] the heavily indebted low-income countries , [ by speeding up the process , by relaxing the eligibility criteria and by broadening and deepening / improving and enhancing existing measures within the current framework of Japan ] the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative ;  
Promoting South-South cooperation , particularly in terms of economic and technical cooperation , and supporting a triangular mechanism whereby donor countries would provide [ financial / appropriate United States ] support for South-South cooperation ; considering the establishment of a generalized trust fund [ supported by voluntary contributions United States ] for triangular economic technical cooperation among developing countries .  
As a multilateral organization with an impressive record of achievements in the industrialization of developing countries and with rich experience in cooperation with the donor countries and international organizations , UNIDO was well qualified to facilitate the flow of resources needed for industrial technical cooperation .  
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
The main objectives outlined in the 1999 consolidated appeal process are to prevent the current humanitarian emergency situation in southern and central Somalia from developing into a dramatic famine , and to continue to foster stability , self-reliance and security in the north .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Encouragement of strategic alliances between research and development institutions and potential technology users to harness the creative capabilities of the scientific communities in the development of new , proven and innovative adaptation strategies and relevant technologies suitable to the particular circumstances of small island developing States , for example , in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities . 
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
In this regard , it stressed that the current forms of cooperation involving the public and private sectors of developing countries should be built upon and expanded , and also stressed the importance of identifying barriers and restrictions to the transfer of publicly and privately owned technologies .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
A joint study was entitled Strengthening the participation of developing countries in world trade and the multilateral trading system was carried out in 1996 , which included sections on improving market access in commercial services and improving the domestic supply response .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
It was agreed that the informal consultations between the focal points of small island developing States and prospective donors represented in New York that had been initiated prior to the meeting should continue with a view to discussing the issues raised during the meeting .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
Other areas of concern to developing countries relate to the proof of sound scientific evidence of their own sanitary and phytosanitary measures , market access restrictions resulting from pests and diseases existing elsewhere in the country concerned ( but not in the region of the exporter ) or , more generally , the potential trade and / or economic impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers applied against their exports .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .  
Ways should be found to enable developing countries to participate more effectively in the formulation of international standards , a very costly process , and gain access to mutual recognition agreements concluded progressively among developed countries ( and which discriminate against developing countries ) , as well as to meet sanitary and phytosanitary regulations .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
UNESCO has been invited to be represented at the first international seminar on traditional carpets and kilims in the Muslim world : past , present and future prospects for developing this heritage with the continuous changes of the market , design , quality and applied techniques ( Tunisia , October 1999 ) .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
Following the rejection of the constitutional reforms in the national referendum on 16 May , the Follow-up Commission , a body established under the peace agreements with the authority to reschedule the parties commitments , has dedicated its attention to developing a viable peace agenda , which would enable the completion of the third phase of the timetable , in consultation with those sectors of civil society that are directly involved in the implementation process .  
In addition to cash transfers for destitute families and children , the chronic sick , elderly and unemployed , assistance should be provided for developing capacities through the provision of basic services , skill training and retraining for the changing employment and market demand , micro-credit facilities , and other productive assets to help to broaden the income support base for the poor and vulnerable groups ;  
In addition , research infrastructures should be strengthened in order to reinforce national capacities to understand the root causes of poverty , collect data , measure and assess its extent in specific economic and sociocultural contexts , as a basis for developing , implementing and evaluating effective policies .  
Regional economic and social commissions should become better skilled at developing non-governmental organization relations at the regional and national levels , with a view to constructing policy and operational partnerships at those levels in implementing United Nations decisions and programmes as well as outcomes of international conferences ;  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries , long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations , was the lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The asymmetric distribution of benefits and risks arising from globalization warrants a global social contract between developing and developed countries , based on genuine solidarity and shared responsibility and with the active involvement of non-State stakeholders with a view to creating a rule-based international system where all countries could take full advantage of the process and where the stronger countries recognize and respect the constraints of the weaker ones .  
In light of the foregoing , KFOR , in close consultation with my Special Representative , is developing a concept for demobilization of the KLA , offering individual members an opportunity to participate in a disciplined , professional , multi-ethnic civilian emergency corps .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
Poland expressed the view that the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States constitutes a positive step towards the implementation of the provisions of Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
These are reflected in initiatives undertaken by UNIDO for the planned subregional forums and the upgrading of certain national UNIDO country offices to regional offices , with a view to developing regional integrated programmes to address the special economic problems of the affected countries .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
The initiative in Azerbaijan directs special attention to promotion of economic opportunities among young disabled adults by training in selected commercial services to meet the demands of its developing economy .  
With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based on global market forces would be more rapid , more sustainable and more widely shared than in the past , allowing developing countries to narrow the gap with industrial countries and the poorest sections of society to close the income gap with the rich . 
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
In the area of the mobilization of external resources for development , the challenges ahead include the following : mobilizing enhanced and more stable sources of international investment flows towards a larger number of recipient developing countries ; strengthening international cooperation aimed at a reversal of the decline in ODA ; and finding lasting solutions to the debt problems of developing countries .  
On the one hand , the multilateral framework of WTO rules has in certain cases narrowed the range of policy options for Governments : quantitative tools of protection are now largely ruled out , including production allocations and similar means ; tariffs are increasingly subject to binding commitments ; the transition period for national content and trade balancing requirements lapses at the end of 1999 ; and export subsidies will no longer be permitted for most developing countries after 2003 .  
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
Customs have a critical influence on development through the four major tasks they perform : ( 1 ) they are the physical " contact point " between the global and the national economy ; ( 2 ) they collect duties which represent a sizeable part of government revenue in developing countries ; ( 3 ) they are essential in the fight against the traffic in illegal products ; and ( 4 ) they gather trade statistics which are vital for policy-making .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
C Analysing the impact , both positive and negative , of substantial reduction or elimination of export subsidies on developing countries , with particular attention being paid to the special concerns of LDCs , net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) and other small and vulnerable economies .  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Since ideology and determination alone could not secure social development in developing countries , there must be an effort during the special session to strengthen international partnerships with a view to mobilizing the necessary financial assistance , technical know-how and human resources .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating once and for all the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of developing countries on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach ,  
Stressing also the need for a supportive international economic environment that is conducive to improving the developing countries terms of trade , market access and access to technology , as well as to fostering better commodity prices , stable exchange rates and international interest rates and to enabling the provision of sufficient resources for development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Recognizing also that globalization poses severe challenges and risks , particularly for developing countries , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts towards achieving sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards realizing the objective of eradicating poverty ,  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly the countries of origin and destination , to further strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
While reaffirming that all Member States were legally obligated to pay their contributions and arrears in accordance with the Charter , he recognized the need to extend sympathetic understanding to developing countries that were temporarily unable to meet those obligations because of genuine economic difficulties .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to increase allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Developed countries should energetically pursue economic policies conducive to the healthy long-term development of all countries and cooperate actively with developing countries in formulating effective policy measures at both the national and the international level .  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .  
It is therefore important that developing countries , when implementing economic reforms , increasing export competitiveness and building a favourable investment climate , are placed in a position that allows them to carry out such tax , social , environmental and regulatory policies , which are critical in terms of sustainable development .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life , and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries , and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .  
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Any other group or delegation was also free to enrich the debate , bearing in mind the spirit of the report of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD to UNCTAD X . All of that work had been conducted , not in a spirit of sterile confrontation based on abstract principles , but out of a concern to do as much as possible , within the framework of the competences of UNCTAD , to improve the standard of living of people in developing countries . 
The Ministers at Marrakech had also agreed to transmit a message to the WTO Conference in Seattle , demonstrating the G-77s determination to ensure that future multilateral trade initiatives would be focused on achieving a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the global trading system , improving conditions of access for developing country products and services in world markets and correcting imbalances in rights and obligations .  
It had also stressed the need for solidarity in combating poverty and identified the urgent task of strengthening UNCTADs role as an appropriate forum for analysing and designing development strategies that promoted economic growth and social development while contributing to the growth of all developing countries .  
General Assembly resolution 53 / 175 stressed the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment ( preambular para . 12 ) and the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth ( para .  9 ) .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
In general , however , the current international situation was propitious for enhanced economic cooperation between nations and a more determined effort to eliminate the many obstacles still standing in the way of the growth and progress of the developing countries .  
In the area of international trade , he expressed his delegations concern at the fate of major export commodities , such as sugar , after the Lom Convention expired in the coming months and urged WTO to establish specific criteria for the special and preferential treatment of developing countries .  
The specific commitments from developing countries and the donor community to expand basic social services called for at the international meeting on the 20 / 20 initiative held at Hanoi were essential to realizing the goals set at Beijing and Cairo .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
Those overall trends masked the serious debt problems faced by the heavily indebted poor countries and the fact that a growing number of middle-income developing countries had experienced serious payments problems , aggravated by the contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis ( A / 54 / 370 , paras . 3 to 5 ) .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
In crisis-affected countries and marginalized economies in developing regions , where the situation of the working poor was further aggravated by the negative impact of globalization and neoliberal policies , it was vital to protect employment opportunities and to maintain an adequate social safety net .  
In furtherance of the aims of the World Programme of Action concerning disabled persons , ILO was seeking to equalize employment opportunities for persons with disabilities , by advising member States on developing appropriate legislative and institutional frameworks based on its Conventions , building a supportive environment for the social and economic integration of disabled persons , as well as a code of practice on managing disability and related matters in the workplace .  
To overcome the difficulties of living in a small island developing State where the main services and activities were concentrated in only two urban centres , the country had established a mobile team for community development to provide outlying communities with information on nutrition and population issues .  
In particular , small island developing States such as Fiji could not receive an equitable share of the benefits of the global trading system without improved market access , special and differential treatment of their products and enhanced institutional capacity to make the most of global trading opportunities .  
Among the social and economic measures and policies aimed at developing its human resources , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya provided education to all free of charge until completion of the elementary level , free health services , and free social security services for widows , disabled persons and the elderly .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development ;  
India had recognized the crucial importance of science and technology as the determinant of long-term growth , and its booming software industry reflected the potential that sector held for developing countries .  
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .  
It had also urged Governments and the private sector to increase their support for developing an adequate science and technology capacity through appropriate education and research programmes as an indispensable foundation for economic , social , cultural and environmentally sound development .  
In the modern world , the development of national scientific and technological capacities was essential for increasing the competitiveness of the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition and ensuring their real integration into the world economic system .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs and , in this connection , may seek assistance from the international community and UNCTAD in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in regional / subregional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
The international community must also provide support to enable countries to overcome factors impeding full implementation of Beijing goals ; accordingly , the preparatory committee for the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly should address the related issues of resource mobilization , support for structural adjustment , improved market access for developing countries , exchange of technologies and know-how ( the provision of grants for training ) , and development cooperation .  
Recognizing also that globalization poses severe challenges and risks , particularly for developing countries , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts towards achieving sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards realizing the objective of eradicating poverty ,  
Recognizing that , while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty through the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with a long-term perspective ,  
Mr . Cabactulan ( Philippines ) said that more work was needed on the terms of reference for the Panel of Experts on Access and Benefit Sharing in order to ensure that the biological diversity within countries was carefully protected , while at the same time ensuring that such resources were utilized in a manner that fully respected the proprietary rights of indigenous communities and enabled the original developers in developing countries to share the benefits .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
On one of the current sticking points the transboundary movement of living modified organisms intended for consumption or transformation her Government advocated a differentiated solution taking account of the constraints of the international market and the particular situation of developing countries .  
It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
Singapores three-year technical assistance programme for sustainable development which was intended to help developing countries through the provision of training in areas such as urban environmental management , environmental technology , solid waste management , water supply engineering , urban planning and transport management , had so far benefitted more than 1,000 people from 80 countries .  
As far as trade and finance was concerned , the forthcoming round of trade negotiations in the context of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) should be comprehensive and move the process of trade liberalization forward , strengthen the framework for the functioning of the multilateral trading system and ensure that the particular interests and concerns of developing countries were taken into account .  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries . 
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
More coherent policies , established on the basis of broad consensus , should be developed , bearing in mind the need to respect the principle of sovereignty and to ensure flexibility in the policies affecting developing countries , particularly in areas such as the management of capital flows and the choice of capital account regime .  
Capital movements had played a large part in the recent financial crises , and developing countries must honestly evaluate whether their economic policies were adequate to face the challenges of the abrupt demographic , economic and technological changes resulting from globalization .  
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financing environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Good governance and transparency , good management of the State and financial and social policies should include : developing strategies for meeting the basic needs of the community , such as access to credit , in particular for women workers in the informal sector ; popular participation in decisions concerning the community ; equal opportunities in the competitive market economy and accountability in regard to the use of multilateral and bilateral financial aid .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Acutely aware of its ad hoc and temporary nature , the Mission has been pursuing a three-pronged exit strategy : strengthening the state institutions responsible for ensuring respect for human rights , reinforcing the capacity of civil society organizations and the media in the area of human rights monitoring and investigation and developing a body of documents , studies and data on key institutions and human rights issues which have been made public .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls upon all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
Legislative acts adopted in recent years would make it possible to define the legal field for developing traditional types of economic activity as a basis for ensuring the viability of small indigenous peoples , developing local self-government and establishing relations based on partnership with governmental bodies at various levels .  
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
If world commodity markets are left to the &amp; lt ; free play of market forces = , while much high-cost agriculture in developed countries - - even after the Uruguay Round - - continues to be subsidized , the underlying problem of the downward trend in real prices of commodities exported by developing countries is likely to persist .  
The Seattle Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization and the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , to be held at Bangkok , should reassert the continuing need for differential treatment for developing countries and , because there was no one valid model of behaviour , the need for national autonomy .  
Globalization should therefore be re-examined from four broad perspectives : democratization of international economic decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues by international institutions ; reform of the international financial architecture ; and effective action against the marginalization of developing countries .  
The current initiative , however , had alleviated only a small part of the debt of a limited number of countries and she therefore welcomed the progress achieved at the recent annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF to achieve dramatic cuts in the debt burden of the heavily indebted developing countries , linking those cuts to poverty reduction strategies . 
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
In recognition of the crushing burden that external debt placed on developing nations and the resultant inability of those countries to attend to social and environmental issues , the Initiative used debt relief as an instrument for resolving many of the social and developmental problems faced by such countries .  
Mr . Sharma ( India ) said , in reviewing the world economic situation , that in the late 1980s and early 1990s globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change had seemingly held out to humanity the promise of historic change , a promise of fresh opportunities , as the developing countries increasingly participated in the growth of the world economy , to improve living standards and secure a brighter future for millions mired in poverty and underdevelopment .  
The rapid growth of capital markets and financial liberalization was the other key pillar of globalization which had been projected as providing a definitive solution to the resources constraint that developing countries had traditionally faced .  
Pakistan was concerned by the reference in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( A / 54 / 36 , para . 60 ) to the fact that the Working Group on Common Indicators , established by the United Nations Development Group , was developing civil and political rights indicators to complement existing economic and social indicators .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
While his delegation fully supported the use of measures to encourage the timely , full and unconditional payment of assessed contributions , it was concerned that the effect of those outlined in the report might be the opposite of what was intended and that they might penalize a number of developing countries .  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , including through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Policy makers in other developing countries were encouraged by the international media to read the lesson of the Asian crisis , not as a cautionary tale about the dangers of opening capital markets without first developing the appropriate regulatory apparatus , but rather as evidence that State involvement in economic governance should be reduced . 
The idea that the political leaders of developing countries might be able to make use of the WTO to advance shared interests is radical , but the idea that civil society might find in the WTO a vehicle for pursuing interests , which are defined socially rather than nationally , is even more so .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;

Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The manual , which will cover independent time-use surveys and multi-purpose surveys , and will highlight the special issues raised by those surveys in developing countries , will be based on ongoing national work and pilot studies supported by the project . 
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
17 .  Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Calls upon all Governments and all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative , administrative and economic measures , policies and practices of a coercive nature against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing countries , which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Reaffirms that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
While developed countries had remained relatively unscathed by the recent financial crisis , in developing countries the gains of decades of economic and social progress had been erased overnight and millions had been thrown back into poverty .  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The development of the developing countries was hampered by a debt burden equivalent to a huge proportion of their export revenues ( over 50 per cent in Latin America and nearly 30 per cent in Africa ) and by protectionism ; rigid quality standards that were difficult to meet ; and falling commodity prices .  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
Current international economic relations , being based on a unipolar policy and attempts by many wealthy States to impose an economic system or systems at the international level solely with a view to furthering their own interests , cause severe economic crises in the developing countries and are highly detrimental to the realization of the right to development .  
The problem of external debt , structural adjustment programmes , economic globalization , unequal access to commercial markets , the collapse of basic commodity prices and speculation in hard currencies are obstacles to development and are detrimental not only to the political independence of developing countries but also to their economic and development policies and their ability to forecast the evolution of their economic situation at the national and international levels .  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Can the barriers to international trade for agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough for a poverty reduction strategy for rural areas of the developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm activities rather than on social programmes and safety nets ?  
The primary components of the draft sustainable energy and climate change strategy include : promoting strategic innovations in the delivery of sustainable energy services in rural areas of developing countries ; increasing the use of market-based policies to achieve climate change objectives ; and encouraging the participation of developing countries in climate change negotiations by promoting their capacity to identify , negotiate and implement key issues .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating once and for all the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of developing countries on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach ,  
Stressing also the need for a supportive international economic environment that is conducive to improving the developing countries terms of trade , market access and access to technology , as well as to fostering better commodity prices , stable exchange rates and international interest rates and to enabling the provision of sufficient resources for development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
UNISPACE III , which had taken place in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and the exhibition of space science and technology organized in parallel with that event , had given the participants an opportunity to evaluate the current state of international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space and to consider ways and means of further developing the respective programmes and strategies with which humankind would enter the twenty-first century .  
Representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and scientific institutions in the field of outer space participating in the conference had had an opportunity to exchange views and make constructive proposals on ways and means to strengthen the regime for the peaceful uses of outer space , develop international cooperation and increase the potential of States , especially developing countries , to use scientific achievements to promote the development process .  
The benefits of space exploration should not be available only to those countries which possessed advanced technology ; international cooperation in that area was required , first of all to meet the requirements of developing countries , since the appropriate use of outer space could open broad possibilities for ensuring the sustainable economic development of all countries .  
Socialism had different related meanings : it represented an intellectual trend based on the critique of the developing bourgeois society ; it was the expression of a political and social movement aiming at reforms , influence or power ; and it referred to an ideal economic and social system intended to replace and overcome capitalism and its perceived flaws .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasising also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
At the 42nd meeting , on 18 November , the representative of Guyana , on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 77 and China and Mexico , introduced a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable and equitable international financial system , responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 ) , which read : The General Assembly ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
At the 49th meeting , on 14 December , the Vice-Chairman of the Committee , Giovanni Brauzzi ( Italy ) , introduced , a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 72 ) , which he submitted on the basis of informal consultations held on draft resolution A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 . 
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may be either inadequate or unavailable ,  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships so as to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
The current environment , driven by free market forces and unpredictable capital fluctuations had been favourable to countries which benefited from sound economic conditions , technology and capital but unfavourable to the majority of developing countries which were relatively uncompetitive and marginalized .  
In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
The economic weaknesses of small island developing States were well known : narrow economic base , low levels of diversification , heavy dependence on external trade ; shortage of skilled manpower ; and the brain drain .  
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
The first principle was the necessity to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful uses and to promote international cooperation in the use of outer space for such purposes , taking into account the imperative of achieving continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries .  
Mr . Rayani ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that UNISPACE III had emphasized the importance of providing the developing countries with opportunities to use the latest achievements of space science and technology for the purposes of economic development and for forecasting natural disasters , especially since outer space was not the exclusive property of any individual State but the common heritage of mankind .  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
The effect on developing countries includes reduced economic investments , more decaying neighbourhoods and fewer government resources allotted to essential social development programmes such as education , health and programmes promoting gender and ethnic equality .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
Plays an active role in developing and facilitating consultations with Governments , including through permanent missions accredited to UNEP in Nairobi , leading to better understanding of Governments expectations and environmental needs , and keeps Governments informed of UNEPs ongoing activities and plans ;  
It was therefore important to reinforce regional and international cooperation in combating drugs and essential to assist developing countries whether drug producing or otherwise in the administrative , judicial , economic and social areas , among other things by sharing information on investigation techniques , crop substitution , detoxification and reintegration of drug addicts into society .  
As some city groups had been very active in developing further the conceptual and methodological thinking in many areas of economic statistics , ISWGNA decided to seek the dialogue with those city groups whose work was related to the area of national accounting .  
The failure of the international community to prevent such massive suffering in the half century since the trials in Tokyo and Nuremberg makes tragically clear the urgency of developing comprehensive measures for combating impunity as well as strong and effective early-warning and conflict-prevention measures to prevent genocide .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
During the past four years under Mr . Ricupero ' s stewardship , UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy , participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations , predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment.He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries .  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45-72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
Less visible but nonetheless destructive violations of human rights are the growth of poverty in rich and developing countries alike , and the marginalization caused by violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Dominican Republic is convinced that reform of the Security Council must be carried out in keeping with the principles of equitable geographical distribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States , since no reform will be acceptable if it leads to discriminatory treatment of developing nations by developed nations .  
I call upon every Member State , large and small , developed and developing , rich and poor , to work cooperatively to find meaningful solutions and preventive actions for this growing international problem and challenge .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
Much has changed since the World Assembly on Ageing , which was held in Vienna in 1982 , when it was first acknowledged in an important international forum that the ageing of the population was not confined to the industrialized world but was actually going to have its greatest impact in our developing countries .  
Coupled with the adverse effects of widespread and pervasive poverty , the phenomenon of ageing will have far-reaching implications for the efforts of developing countries to achieve the sustained economic growth and social development which are fundamental for ensuring a better quality of life for the entire population .  
The eradication of poverty remains the foremost challenge for the developing world , where policy makers struggle on a daily basis to respond to the most basic needs of their peoples despite dwindling financial resources , disappointing economic growth rates and their countries growing marginalization in the worlds economy .  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
How can we move beyond the Copenhagen commitments when official development assistance has declined to a meagre 0.22 per cent , when assistance to developing countries is increasingly conditional , and when developing countries are prescribed structural adjustment programmes and prescriptions that take no account of social priorities or national characteristics ?  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
While emphasizing the imperative need for the political will on the part of States to facilitate the access of needy populations to assistance and cooperation , it seems to us equally valuable that the Secretary-General has included , as the first point in his annual report , a reference to the importance of developing a culture of prevention to deal with natural disasters . 
In addition , the enormous force of globalization , driven by the advancement of science and technology , instead of serving to unify humankind in a determined and conscious assault against the persistent and systemic problems of our time , is continuously being used to press the advantage of the strong over the weak , and is thereby widening the gap between the developed and the developing worlds .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
In developing countries , atomic energy with its multiple applications in power generation , improving health standards , enhancing the quality and quantity of agricultural yields , pest controls and water resources management is seen as the key to a better future .  
Without denying the importance of developing renewable power sources , we should admit that at present the only realistic industrial-scale solution to this problem is to intensify efforts to develop a safe , environmentally acceptable and economically attractive nuclear power sector.Will the nuclear power industry be equal to a task of this magnitude ?  
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
Once again , we call for developing countries to be able to participate on an equal footing with developed countries in the codification and gradual development of international law as an essential premise for establishing a just and equitable international legal order in the next century.The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m .  
Faced with adverse and sometimes extreme conditions whose horrors the modern media flash instantaneously into all our households , and when the response capability of countries , particularly of the developing countries , is diminished or significantly undermined , mankind suddenly seems reconciled , empathetic and unified ; and from that perspective , humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations is beneficial and of great value to stricken populations . 
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
Indeed , it is in the best interest of the process that the procedural issues pertaining to the meetings be carried out in a swift and prudent manner to allow the actual meeting period to be dedicated to more substantive work.We further support the notion reflected in the draft resolution that , with regard to the appointment of the co-chairpersons , there needs to be representation from both developed and developing countries .  
The current economic world situation is a cause for great concern for developing countries , and it is vital to seek and to foster new forms of international economic cooperation based on a partnership with reciprocal gains for all the participants .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
At the same time , it is astonishing that a regime that has a dark record of developing , producing and stockpiling many inhumane kinds of weapons of mass destruction ventures to accuse a country that is among those in the Middle East that have joined the most basic international instruments in effect in the field of disarmament .  
While the United Nations has created a judicial affairs office that deals with the court system , the prosecution service and the correctional system in Kosovo , the OSCE Rule of Law Division which is part of the Rule of Law and Human Rights Department is tasked with developing mechanisms to ensure that the police , courts , administrative structures and other judicial structures are operating in accordance with international standards of criminal justice and human rights .  
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
In short , Lithuania , inter alia , supports these elements : a Security Council enlarged to around 24 members , enlargement in both categories , new permanent seats for industrialized and developing countries , regional rotation for those regions that agree on the concept , effective review , further and constant democratization and transparentization of the Security Council ' s methods of work , and the curtailment and eventual abolition of the veto .  
Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Mr . Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
I must stress again the need for an increase in international assistance , which we , as a developing country , need if we are to reduce the death rate from the HIV AIDS pandemic , from infectious or parasitic diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera , and most of all to meet the needs of young men and women for reproductive and sexual health . 
It is for this reason that the Kingdom of Swaziland is in the process of developing a national population policy and a comprehensive reproductive health programme with the participation of representatives of religious leaders , traditional and community leaders , non-governmental organizations , academic institutions , youth and other special groups as well as experts , policy makers and planners .  
In this respect , major challenges face not only developing countries , but also developed ones , and demographic ageing will manifest itself in growth in the cost of old-age pensions , medical care and assistance in daily needs .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Encouragement of strategic alliances between research and development institutions and potential technology users to harness the creative capabilities of the scientific communities in the development of new , proven and innovative adaptation strategies and relevant technologies suitable to the particular circumstances of small island developing States , for example , in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
We believe that the Barbados Programme of Action , which calls for actions to be implemented at the national , regional and international levels , provides for an integrated and comprehensive basis for the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
He also described my countrys vision of the future in the light of the architecture of the current international system , and he formulated some concrete proposals to further the search for solutions to the many grave problems facing humanity , now and in the future , particularly the dilemma of the developing countries .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
It is true that the small island developing States will have to make their own efforts for development , but the vigorous support of the international community is indispensable given that economic globalization is creating unprecedented and fierce competition .  
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
The United Nations system itself must continue to play the role of catalyst and stimulant in implementing the Barbados Programme of Action ; it must make more effective use of existing resources and improve the coordinating machinery for focused , agreed implementation activities in priority areas for the achievement of the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Qatar , which is aware of the international communitys important role in helping small island developing States and other developing countries achieve social development , hopes that the States of the developed world will play their proper role in supporting the economies of developing countries and in reducing the consequences of globalization on our fragile economies .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
The importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes is reaffirmed .  
Encourage the international community , including bilateral donors and multilateral development organizations , to assist developing countries in ensuring the provision of basic social services , including health-care services for women , in particular during periods of economic difficulty ; socially and gender-sensitive approaches to structural adjustment policies are further encouraged ;  
Urges the Secretary-General , in collaboration with relevant United Nations bodies , to organize , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , regional expert group meetings with a view to developing gender - and age-disaggregated and gender-sensitive psychosocial and mental health situation analyses and indicators as bases for determining progress in womens and girls emotional well-being and mental health ;  
We are confident that the Committee jurisprudence will be open to a developing interpretation of the most controversial points , in the light of the practice of other human rights treaty bodies , and also of the peculiarity of the CEDAW Convention , which provides for a wider scope of social and cultural human rights than other international instruments .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
In this context , the international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect the intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Engage industries and economic sectors , in both public and private sectors , and all other major groups at the national and international levels , as appropriate , in activities relating to sustainable consumption and production with the objective of developing optimal strategies and or programmes , including targets and timetables , at the appropriate levels for more sustainable consumption and production , including cleaner production and affordable eco-efficiency .  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
Some delegations stated that cleaner production and eco-efficiency , based on improved skills , technologies and efficient use of energy and resources , were essential to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Data based on a number of indicators of the gender gap for different regions show that , for developing countries as a whole , the adult literacy rate is 16 percentage points higher for men than for women ; female school enrolment even at the primary level is 13 per cent lower than the level for males ; and womens share of earned income is a third of the total .  
Developing the capacity to export is particularly crucial in light of the fast expansion of international trade and the limited size of the domestic market of many developing countries .  
The Committee recognized that vulnerability was an important issue for many developing countries , especially the least developed countries ; but to capture all the complex components of vulnerability in just one index posed severe analytical and technical difficulties . 
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial arrangements .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
In the context of its contribution to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , ILO was currently developing an urban employment programme focused on more and better jobs in the informal sector aimed , among other things , at improving the living and working environment in poor urban neighbourhoods and increasing the capacity of national and municipal governments to create jobs in cities ; it would also promote the adoption of innovative approaches to urban job creation .  
Also reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA flows , on the other hand , continued to be driven by and large by historical and geographical ties .  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
The recommendations contained in document E CN . 17-1996-20 Add . 4 continue to be valid and represent minimum conditions that should be fulfilled if small island developing States are to be provided with transport services necessary for balanced structural development as well as improved participation in world trade .  
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
We have established diplomatic relations and are developing beneficial cooperation with all of them , in accordance with the provisions of resolution 50-80 B . In accordance with our foreign policy of open borders and equality and taking advantage of our geostrategic position as a central State in the Balkans we are becoming an important place for the development of international cooperation in all of south-eastern Europe . 
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
It was reasonable to expect that , in the foreseeable future , most of the pertinent telecommunication activities and services in developing countries would develop and revolve around those thrust areas , which had been identified as follows : ( a ) distance education ; ( b ) mobile personal communications ; ( c ) direct-to-home television and radio broadcasting ; ( d ) telemedicine ; ( e ) rural telecommunications ; and ( f ) Internet services .  
The farming systems approach to development is considered to be potentially useful in improving planning and analytical capacity in identifying , developing and implementing ways to improve the productivity and therefore welfare of those involved in agriculture in a manner that is equitable and sustainable .  
These companies are developing their offers more and more aggressively , putting forward arguments for legitimacy based on military efficiency , cheaper operations , their personnel ' s proven experience and an alleged comparative advantage that would make it feasible or desirable to hire them for peace _ building or peacekeeping operations such as those conducted by the United Nations or ECOWAS .  
Recalling the widely shared desire expressed during the high-level dialogue of the General Assembly , held on 17 and 18 September 1998 , which constituted a renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , to continue discussions with a view to developing a coherent and effective response to the opportunities and challenges being offered by globalization and interdependence ,  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements , to address issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Also invites the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in close cooperation with the regional economic commissions , within their respective mandates and current resources , as well as with other relevant international organizations , to provide technical assistance and advisory services to the newly independent landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , taking into account the relevant transit transport agreements ;  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
The major challenge facing the international community is to assist Governments , especially those of developing countries , to promote tourism development within the framework of sustainable development in order to maximize the potential economic and social benefits from tourism without damaging the environment or cultural assets .  
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
In a noteworthy educational project that takes a holistic approach in addressing the needs of the internally displaced and host populations alike , the Norwegian Refugee Council ( NRC ) is developing a nationwide human rights education programme which will provide training and course material on human rights standards to all schools .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Deeply concerned that the international financial crisis has acquired extremely worrying dimensions , posing a threat to world economic development , and that if it were allowed to continue financial turmoil could result in major setbacks to the global economy , in particular to the progress that most developing countries have achieved in the 1990 s ,  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
Based on the experiences of the past 20 years , it is evident that while the energy strategies of the small island economies will continue to remain primarily focused on improving the management and regulation of petroleum fuels and electric power plants , increasing the role for renewable energy should become an important part of the overall strategy in many small island developing States . 
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
This also would include the development of codes of conduct and frameworks of legislation for the control of invasive and exotic plant and animal species in small island developing States in view of their potential negative impact on indigenous or endemic species .  
Most small island developing States have realized that their inherent , characteristic disadvantages make it all the more necessary for them to develop effective institutions and administrative capacity in order to meet the multitude of challenges arising from the imperatives of resource conservation and environmental protection .  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
Concluding asset-sharing arrangements as a means of enabling forfeited proceeds of crime to be used to strengthen the capacity of national criminal justice systems and contributing a part of such proceeds to programmes such as those aimed at enhancing national capacities for fighting crime in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , paying due consideration to the rights of bona fide third parties ;  
To continue to provide advisory and technical cooperation services to Member States requesting assistance in drafting and implementing appropriate national legislation and in developing and implementing bilateral , subregional , regional or international treaties on mutual assistance in criminal matters , drawing on the expertise of Member States as appropriate ;  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
That contracting authorities interested in developing a privately financed infrastructure projects , within their sphere of competence conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility , as well as the environmental impact of the project ;  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Research and development networks were a vital way for research institutes and firms in developing countries to leverage their knowledge base with respect to new technologies , including environmentally sound technologies , while partnerships amongst firms in close proximity made possible the creation of the positive externalities such as training programmes and testing laboratories that were needed to meet the new quality standards .  
While highlighting the primary responsibility of national Governments for the development and promotion of SMEs , representatives from developing countries emphasized the critical need for appropriate support and assistance from the international community , particularly through the UNCTAD technical assistance programmes which were relevant to enterprise development .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for further implementation in an effective , equitable and development-oriented way of existing mechanisms for the treatment of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens , and , in this context , stressing the need to agree upon equitable burden-sharing among the international public creditor community ,  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
In spite of the constraints encountered , many small island developing States have established initiatives to balance tourism activities with broader economic , social and environmental objectives at the regional , national and local levels .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
The Bank and other agencies that play key roles in developing multilateral PPPs can not get too deeply involved in the internal control and supervision of national basic data collection in participating countries .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
The General Assembly call upon developed countries to commit themselves to the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overall development assistance should be emphasized , as well as the Assembly ' s call upon both developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of their official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
While the deliberative process is still ongoing , the greater understanding of the implications of environmental protection for the sustainability of socio-economic development and for the improvement of the quality of life has induced concrete actions in small island developing States to begin the implementation of the Programme of Action .  
The indirect evidence , which is itself sketchy , is that small island developing States , each one at its own pace , are increasingly using a variety of economic instruments and environmental tools such as the environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) and geographic information systems ( GIS ) , strengthening regulations , reforming relevant policies , and implementing priority projects at the sectoral and subsectoral levels to prevent adverse impacts on the environment .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA , on the other hand , continued by and large to be driven by historical and geographical ties .  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
In recognition of the difficulty of building adequate levels of skills at the national level , small island developing States , particularly in the Pacific and the Caribbean , have established regional institutions by pooling their resources or fashioned new forms of collaboration among existing ones .  
In these and other areas , there is a need for concerted efforts at the international level to provide small island developing States with access to technology on affordable terms , and to assist them in their efforts at establishing regional centres for capacity-building including training in the assessment of technologies as well as their management , technology negotiations and partnerships leading to technology transfer , and adaptation of available technology to local conditions .  
This will require that the Programme of Action be firmly placed on the political agenda at the national , regional and international levels and be fully recognized by Governments and civil society in all small island developing States and the international community as the framework for sustainable development activities in small island developing States .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
The Chinese delegation has always supported such draft resolutions , for the following reasons : first , we support the promotion of international cooperation for the peaceful uses of science and technology so that they can accelerate the economic and social development of countries , particularly the developing countries.Secondly , export control regimes on dual-use goods and technologies should be set up with the universal participation of the international community .  
The subprogramme will give the necessary attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainability , including the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional resources to developing countries , changing production and consumption patterns and mechanisms for technology transfer as mutually agreed to address poverty as an overriding issue .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
Similarly , ICLARM , whose operating mission is geared to research and capacity-building in natural resources management , fisheries stock assessment and aquaculture , assisted in a South South training initiative among a number of scientists from the developing world in quantitative genetics and its application to select breeding .  
To help strengthen the capacities of developing countries in sustainable human development through TCDC , the Unit supported a number of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the sharing of experiences in critical areas and strengthening networking among centres of excellence .  
Secondly , as evidenced in the report above , TCDC - both as a modality and as an integral component of contemporary international development cooperation - is increasingly recognized and appreciated by the international community , as offering viable opportunities for improving socio-economic development of developing countries and for enabling their participation and integration in the global economy .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
The key elements of the infrastructure are the databases and developing databases for different purposes and users ( private , public , scientific and government ) is the major task to be accomplished in a systematic development of infrastructure .  
The development of more cost-effective mapping procedures based on satellite data will surely result in increased use of remote sensing data and consequently expand the market for such data , enabling developing countries to collect and update basic information on the topographic and thematic ( natural resource ) cartography of their territories .  
The Cologne initiative should be flexibly interpreted by the international financial institutions to the full benefit of all debtors without discrimination , and appropriate resources should be devoted to reduce considerably the stock of debt and its servicing , while bearing in mind that debt relief measures should safeguard social , economic and political stability in developing countries .  
The concept of special and differential treatment should be reviewed and strengthened to take account of the changing realities of world trade and of globalized production , and must be accompanied by capacity-building , enhanced market access and measures taken by industrialized countries to encourage their enterprises and institutions to transfer technology and know-how and invest in developing countries .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
Mr . Talbot ( Guyana ) speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reaffirmed that the fundamental characteristics of operational activities universality , neutrality , multilateralism , non-conditionality and responsiveness to the priorities and needs of developing countries in a flexible manner distinguished the operational activities of the United Nations from those of institutions such as the World Bank and were critical to their future effectiveness and credibility .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) said that the potential development impact of TCDC for developing countries was increasingly being recognized , since South-South cooperation was essential as a means of sharing relevant development experiences , his delegation welcomed the leading role increasingly being taken by developing countries themselves in initiating , organizing and financing TCDC activities , since national ownership and commitment were crucial to the success of South-South cooperation . 
While the active contribution of national authorities and the United Nations system was vital for a successful implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and the New Directions Strategy , the involvement of the private sector and of non-governmental organizations was indispensable in fostering a viable business sector in the developing countries .  
His Government had provided a total of over US $ 2-billion dollars in bilateral and multilateral technical , scientific and economic cooperation to other developing countries and planned to extend its cooperation to include not only Asia and Africa , but also the South Pacific , the Caribbean and Central America and to promote the concept of multiple beneficiaries .  
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .  
In accordance with its original terms of reference , the Committee on Contributions should make concrete recommendations on the methodology for determining the scale of assessments , with a view to making it objective and equitable , and should take into account the problems of developing countries , such as their difficulties in earning foreign exchange and the economic strain of taking in refugees .  
The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .  
In order to ensure that the developing and emerging States derived the maximum economic benefit from the new arrangements , the Commissions legal standards and guidance must take careful note of international financial and capital markets and foster a willingness to modify existing national laws .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes , including son preference , which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection , discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against women , including female genital mutilation , rape , incest , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation . 
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area . 
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Reaffirms that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
International cooperation to that end must be strengthened and the relevant international organizations must take concrete measures , such as technology transfer , financial support and scientific and technical training , in favour of the developing countries .  
The Conference had taken stock of developments in space science and applications , explored new areas of cooperation , considered the changing economic and political environment which offered new opportunities for international cooperation and studied the constraints and issues faced by developing countries in building national capacities to benefit from space technology as well as ways to involve the private sector more closely in the process .  
His delegation looked forward to enhanced regional and international cooperation in space-related activities , as the potential spin-off benefits for the developing countries in such areas as agriculture , industry , medicine and remote sensing were substantial .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Access to the markets of developed countries , the reduction in the external debt of heavily indebted developing countries , together with an increase in ODA , should be the key elements of any credible international policy designed to find a lasting solution to the problem of financing for development .  
He urged the international community to establish a rule-based , equitable and transparent multilateral trading system and said that he hoped that the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations would promote development , eliminate trade barriers against developing countries and increase preferential treatment to promote the financing of development through trade .  
The key to fulfilment of those noble objectives and plans of action was financing for development , and it was imperative that a coordinated international effort should be made to address the problems faced by developing countries and to enhance their capacities to play a more active role in the world economy .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
In its resolution 37-90 of 10 December 1982 , the General Assembly decided that , in accordance with the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , 1 the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be directed towards , among other things , stimulating the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in developing countries .  
Recognizing that while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty by the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with long-term perspectives ,  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financing environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and the continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , inter alia through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
In developing countries , such corruption may undermine economic development through a number of related factors : the misuse or waste of international aid ; unfinished development projects ; discovery and replacement of corrupt politicians , leading to political instability ; and living standards remaining below the countrys potential .  
It must not be forgotten that the European Union already has a single currency , is developing common foreign and defence policies , and even recently appointed a high official to coordinate that undertaking .  
Goals and targets agreed upon by the international community in relation to sustainable development , such as the adoption of national sustainable development strategies and increased support to developing countries , must be implemented in a timely fashion .  
When , after the end of the cold war , the world seemed to be developing towards a promising situation because of the gradual reduction of interState conflicts , the African continent suddenly fell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented violence .  
Unless the developing nations are able to have a fair share in rising levels of global prosperity , the advocacy of democratic values and human and social standards will remain hollow .  
Let us look towards a new vision for a future that will incorporate the weak and strong , the rich and poor and the developed and developing world , so that none will be marginalized .  
The reality shows that the globalization process , based on the international economic relations favourable only for the developed countries , is aggravating poverty in the developing countries and widening disparities between the rich and the poor countries .  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
There exist in the current international political and economic order many unjust and unreasonable factors that are not conducive to the stability and development of the many developing countries .  
For relevant least developed countries in particular , including small island developing States , this may represent a considerable expenditure in the short term , while having a bearing on the future mapping of the natural resources of the continental shelf .  
It should be emphasized that such cooperative activities implemented through effective programmes would contribute significantly to improving the scientific , technological and regulatory capabilities of the developing countries .  
We consider it of prime importance that the renewed Council be a representative and balanced organ through the inclusion of new members , from industrially developed countries and influential developing States alike , pursuing independent foreign policies .  
The draft resolution is entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity .  
The Government of the Slovak Republic has committed itself to developing policies and programmes that will secure and extend the participation of women as equal partners in all areas of political , economic , social and cultural life .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
We are committed to global cooperation to foster international goodwill and understanding and universal friendship and to work in worldwide partnerships developing and promoting a culture of peace .  
The textile and clothing sector , of vital interest to many developing countries , is subject to declining quantitative restrictions until 2005 , with the most meaningful liberalization of existing quotas coming last .  
In retrospect , for some developing countries the period of the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of the heavy burden of debt servicing , falling commodity prices , negative economic growth , unemployment and structural adjustment .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
Although official development finance ( ODF ) has risen from its level in 1996 , that increase of about $ 15-billion has not been sufficient to prevent a sharp drop in the total net resource flow to developing countries in 1998 .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Many developing countries have also lifted controls on interest rates , reduced governmentdirected credit , developed new instruments for longterm investment financing and built a more effective regulatory and supervisory structure for the financial sector .  
The phenomenal technological advances of the twentieth century had brought about strong industrial growth in the developed world but had left the developing countries far behind .  
It had identified strengthened industrial capacity and clean and sustainable industrial development as the two main priority areas of its technical assistance to the developing countries .  
Its members , who were all highly qualified and experienced in their specializations , understood the concerns of developing countries and appreciated what bilateral and multilateral donors required in project design , preparation and implementation .  
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
Several comprehensive programmes on sustainable farming systems are being promoted by national authorities in developed and developing countries , by regional and international institutions and NGOs .  
While welcoming the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( A / 54 / 36 ) , she noted that it related to developing countries in particular and focused more on civil and political rights than on economic , social and cultural rights .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and significance of official development assistance ( ODA ) , which is a vital resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to international private capital .  
The principles of gradual liberalization in the developing countries , and of differentiated and special treatment of the least developed countries , must be recognized and become an integral element in future trade negotiations .  
Several delegations expressed the view that , for such negotiations to be successful , developed countries must find the political will to overcome narrow domestic interests and deal with the concerns of developing countries in an equitable manner .  
A third part is the increasingly large and unpredictable private capital flows across national boundaries that have substantially reduced the leverage of Governments , particularly of developing countries , in controlling their economic fate .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Many Governments stressed that developing countries would need technical and financial assistance from the international community to prepare effectively for and participate in the national and regional preparatory processes .  
In close coordination with local and national authorities , steps to promote social and institutional advances can help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
She also raised the legal , economic , social , human and environmental problems caused by the export of contaminated ships destined for scrap in developing countries .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Demands of labour mobility accompanying the growth of the market economy in some developing countries have created a transient internal population , with low and insecure wages and poor access to housing , medical care and schooling for their children .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
Electricity is increasingly assuming greater importance in the total energy mix , particularly in developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as important to economic and social development .  
In the light of the changing nature of security problems , with more intrastate as opposed to interState conflicts , special attention will have to be placed on developing coherent , comprehensive approaches to crises .  
There is however no easy fix for the institutional impediments in many developing countries , above all unsupportive regulatory environments and exorbitant charges imposed by national authorities .  
By the same token , the rest of the world can not ignore the unique contribution of small island developing States to global sustainability , through their rich biodiversity , their vast areas of marine resources and their coral reef systems .  
Small island developing States on their own are simply unable to shoulder the vast responsibility that falls upon them the guardianship of the essential global public goods , without increased support from the international community .  
UNDP will work in close coordination with local and national authorities to take steps to promote social and institutional advances to help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
The resources devoted to huge arsenals nuclear and conventional take up the funds that could be devoted to economic development and social progress , which is of great importance to the people of developed and developing countries alike .  
Investment in education , including basic and digital literacy , remains the fundamental way of developing human capacity and should be at the heart of any national , regional and international information technology strategy .  
To further foster the exchange of national and regional experiences in the functional commissions , donors are encouraged to provide financial resources to support participation of additional experts from developing countries .  
With regard to public and private resources , we are currently developing a mixed welfareState model that gives public support in the form of financial relief and special subsidies and the like to private institutions providing social services .  
They also result in inequities in international economic relations and in a widening gap between the rich developed countries of the north and the poor developing countries of the south , where 80 per cent of the worlds poorest live .  
It was considered that the narrative should have included references to the effects of endemic structural adjustments and to the negative impact of the economic crisis at the international level which affected developing countries .  
The following issues are raised to solicit responses from States on the diverse effects of globalization at the national , regional and international levels , as a means of developing understanding for a constructive exchange of views on globalization .  
APFIC reported that the issues concerning illegal , unregulated and unreported ( IUU ) fishing were widely recognized and were ongoing in the APFIC area , by both developed and developing fishing nations .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Residual effects of regional conflicts and of the tension that marked the cold war have led to an unprecedented increase in the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons , whose intended recipients are mainly developing countries .  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
It is imperative that even as we work towards developing the requisite political will , in the interim the international community accepts the need for urgent practical steps that will diminish nuclear dangers .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
At both local and international levels , Egypt had taken earnest steps to prevent crime and establish social justice through its legislative , executive and judicial authorities by developing and updating its laws and devising appropriate punishment regimes .  
But it was not just a question of free trade ; many developing countries were desperately in need of basic physical , educational , legal and even political infrastructure in order to participate in the global economy .  
In keeping with the concept of shared responsibility in promoting economic and social development , it was understood that the scarce resources of the developing countries should be supplemented by the huge resources at the disposal of the developed nations .  
What has been missing is the supportive external economic environment that has been considered critical to ensure accelerated development in developing countries .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .  
Lastly , he stressed the importance of moving beyond the NorthSouth divide and developing partnerships with key nongovernmental actors in globalization , including international economic institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
In the interests of preserving cultural diversity , the European Union also considered it essential that the local content of the Internet in the developing countries , and particularly in the least developed countries , should be enhanced and developed .  
It had pointed to empirical evidence showing that the gap was growing between the developed and developing countries in the wake of globalization , and concluded that the prime objective should be to make globalization beneficial for all countries and peoples .  
For some , the international level was most important : inadequate regulation allowed speculative capital to cascade in and out of fragile markets in the developing world .  
Clearly , the active and growing participation of the developing countries in trade flows required a competitive economy at the national level , but also a favourable international environment .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
He said that landlocked developing countries left on their own would not be able to cope with the formidable challenges posed by the acute problems facing them and that this fact was clearly recognized by the international community .  
The textile and clothing sector , of vital interest to many developing countries , is subject to declining quantitative restrictions until 2005 , with the most meaningful liberalization of existing quotas coming last , and tariffs in the sector will remain high .  
This , as noted above , requires in turn an enabling international environment , including dynamic trade opportunities and a substantial , stable and sustained net transfer of resources to developing countries and lowerincome transition economy countries .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
Although global ODA flows have been declining and they have become small relative to private flows of capital , it was reported that aid to the Pacific island developing countries has been maintained and will be required for some decades to come . 
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
Of critical importance is a fair , equitable and rulesbased multilateral trading system , operating in a nondiscriminatory , inclusive and transparent manner that provides benefits for all countries , especially developing countries .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
Enhancing trade for financing development : ensuring market access for products of export interest to developing countries ; addressing issues related to the decline of public revenues from trade liberalization ; strengthening regional cooperation / integration for expansion of global trade ; capacity-building and technical assistance , including assistance for trade negotiations and dispute settlement ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
The discussion revolved around providing specific time frames towards meeting the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to counter the declines in past years ; developing each countrys own comprehensive strategy , including the establishment of sound macroeconomic policies and national partnerships in an effort to use ODA most effectively ; and the growing concerns regarding global public goods .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
Invites the Bureau of the preparatory committee to play an active and important role in the intergovernmental preparations for the World Summit and to mobilize political support at the highest possible level in both developed and developing countries while pursuing the support of all heads of international organizations within the United Nations system and of international financial institutions and the Global Environment Facility and to actively support the role of the Committee in monitoring with a view to considering the reports of all relevant intergovernmental processes .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken through the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish and operate regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Some delegations reiterated the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource with sui generis characteristics that risked saturation , and that its utilization should be based on the principle of rational and equitable access for all countries , taking into account the special needs of developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
Also calls upon States and regional economic integration organizations to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund established by the United Nations Environment Programme in order to support the interim arrangements and the operation of the Conference of the Parties until the end of the fiscal year in which the first meeting of the Conference of Parties takes place , and to ensure the full and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the further work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ;  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
As to his own preventive role , the Secretary-General thinks that it could be enhanced by increasing the use of interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile areas ; by developing regional prevention strategies with regional partners and the relevant United Nations organs and agencies ; by establishing an informal network of eminent persons ; and by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
We , therefore , support the ideas contained in the report for strengthening the Secretary-Generals traditional roles in this area by , for example , increasing the use of interdisciplinary United Nations fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , developing regional preventive strategies with relevant regional organizations and establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
In this context , we see the reported achievements especially as establishing conditions on the ground allowing the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be free to decide to return to their pre-war homes or to choose to live elsewhere , and as developing a modern , independent and effective judiciary system as well as responsible and non-political police structures .  
Preliminary discussions with UNCHS identified the following areas of possible cooperation for further consideration : ( a ) substantive support to the Special Rapporteur in carrying out his mandate ; ( b ) developing a joint United Nations housing rights programme and , in this context , supporting the UNCHS Global Campaign on Secure Tenure as a component of housing rights ; ( c ) promoting integration of a housing rights component in field operations , advisory services and technical cooperation activities ; and ( d ) contributing to the Istanbul + 5 process .  
The independent expert has drawn attention to the following multilateral facilities dealing with the debt problems of developing countries : structural adjustment and concessional financing facilities of international financial institutions , world trade organizations and developed industrial countries programmes of providing market access , restructuring of the international financial system to solve the many problems of inadequacy and instability of financial flows of developing countries .  
The international community should therefore renew its support for the Office by at least maintaining the level of its contributions thereby enabling it , until such time as definitive solutions were found , to relieve human suffering , particularly in the developing countries , which received the largest number of refugees .  
The worldwide network of institutions collaborating through the workshops in the past decade has been supporting : ( a ) ground-based networks of small optical and radio telescopes and associated research and education programmes ; and ( b ) a new concept for a multinational space-based astronomical satellite mission ( World Space Observatory ) , particularly for the benefit of developing countries .  
Large-scale interregional projects are currently being implemented on the initiative of and with direct participation by Turkmenistan in the energy , transport and communication sectors with a view to giving impetus to the accelerated economic development of the countries of the region and narrowing the technology gap between developed and developing and industrial and agrarian States .  
Given the global character that the problem of securing and distributing energy resources is assuming in the twenty-first century , as well as its own huge fuel potential , Turkmenistan has set about developing and implementing large-scale projects involving the laying of pipelines westward , southward and eastward .  
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
Enhance the capacity of developing countries , particularly least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and countries with economies in transition , to analyse the challenges posed by the ongoing processes of liberalization and globalization and the increasing integration of those countries into the global economic system and to formulate appropriate national policies accordingly ;  
Content : Structural features and trade flows , regional and international trade ; the changing role of commodities and services ; trade facilitation , information technology and transport and logistics ; e-commerce ; trade and environment policies , trade and environment in the World Trade Organization ( selected WTO agreements , dispute settlement , built-in agenda ) ; market access ; TRIPS ; traditional knowledge ; as well as the positive agenda and basic elements for the formulation of a developing country trade policy .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
It was held pursuant to paragraph 134 of the Bangkok Plan of Action , adopted by UNCTAD X , and its major objective was to identify , on a country-specific basis , challenges and concerns confronting least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) in the face of the reform process in agriculture and to contribute to the formulation of negotiating proposals by LDCs and NFIDCs in the ongoing World Trade Organization ( WTO ) negotiations on agriculture , so as to ensure that those negotiations would effectively address their concerns .  
Experts indicated that margin of preference in international tendering allocated to local firms should be sufficient to allow their effective participation , and that criteria established for participation in multilaterally financed projects should not be so stringent as to exclude domestic construction firms in developing countries .  
It justly identified deepening poverty and inequality , proliferating conflict , the deadly spread of the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) and continuing discrimination , particularly against women and girls , as formidable challenges in developing future actions for children .  
Until recently , the right to development had not received the recognition it deserved , and yet several developing countries had been chastised for alleged human rights violations , and their failures had been magnified disproportionately , while they were doing their utmost to satisfy the basic necessities of their rapidly growing populations .  
However , given the deep concern of the developing countries with regard to their limited capacity to participate in the global economy and consequent marginalization , one of the major challenges in the coming years would be how to ensure that the benefits of the global economy were shared by all .  
United Nations peacekeeping is an international responsibility to be shared by all States Members of the Organization in all its aspects , but a case can , and has in fact been made , for logistical , training and other technical support from the developed countries for potential troop contributors from the developing countries , even as the former participate actively themselves in peacekeeping operations .  
Japan fully supported the language in the draft resolution taken from the Millennium Declaration ( A / RES / 55 / 2 ) and the outcome document adopted at the end of the World Summit for Social Development and Beyond : Achieving Social Development for All in a Globalizing World , entitled Further initiatives for social development , but was particularly concerned that the eleventh preambular paragraph of the draft resolution stated that the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries had contributed , inter alia , to deepening poverty .  
Underlying the immediate concern over oil prices were the global macroeconomic imbalances and systemic weaknesses exposed by the Asian crisis , and failure to resolve economic imbalances in an orderly manner would be most damaging to growth in developing countries .  
The recent call by industrial countries for coordinated international policy action in the face of rising oil prices was to be welcomed , but it contrasted sharply with the indifference to similar calls from the developing world when faced with the devastating consequences of falling commodity prices .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the least developed countries , said that economic interdependence was a matter of utmost importance for the developing countries , and their interests had to be recognized and reflected in the reform of the international financial system . 
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reiterated the importance attached by his Group to the question of the financing of experts in UNCTAD expert meetings and the need for funding in that respect .  The participation of experts from developing countries enhanced the complementarity between technical cooperation and analytical and deliberative work and helped in integrating these activities , as called for by UNCTAD X .  
Despite the remarkable progress achieved in the 1990s ( in which 80 per cent of young children in developing countries had been immunized ; polio was on the verge of eradication ; more children than ever before were enrolled in schools ; and iodized salt was now being used on a wide scale ) , too many children were still dying from treatable diseases brought about by various causes linked to poverty and violence and by the AIDS pandemic .  
The UNDG has set up a working group , chaired by UNFPA , with the objective of developing a common process for programme approval , taking into consideration the need for further harmonization and simplification of programmes and programming procedures for all United Nations organizations in the UNDG in order to provide the basis for a substantive , timely and joint oversight function of the respective Executive Boards .  
The main challenge lies both for developed and developing countries in the development , utilization and dissemination of renewable energy technologies , such as solar , wind , ocean , wave , geothermal , biomass and hydro power , on a scale wide enough to significantly contribute to energy for sustainable development .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
[ The [ expansion ( Norway replace with ) enhanced use ] of existing ( Canada replace with ) Use of ] international mechanisms [ ( Canada / Norway delete ) or development of new mechanisms ] to identify risks and ensure they are managed on a transparent basis [ ( Canada delete ) and with an effective and equitable partnership between investors and host countries , for those developing countries that do not have institutional structures that are adequately prepared to deal with the scale of risk associated with major energy investments ] .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
The recognition of special and differential treatments in favour of developing countries and an open , rule-based , transparent , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system are essential factors for a healthy global economic system .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
We stress that the major creditor countries should loosen their grip on the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture ; they should accept that representation in existing multilateral financial institutions should become broader and more balanced and that meaningful participation by developing countries in the decision-making processes , as well as greater transparency in such processes , should be ensured .  
Reaffirm that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to , inter alia , financially and technologically support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to assist them , wherever possible , in the fulfilment of their obligations with regard to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
In the light of the developing situation on the ground and particularly the resumption of hostilities in May 2000 , which necessitated the rapid reinforcement of the military component of the Mission and consequently the rapid transportation of contingent-owned equipment to the mission area , 10,635 and 2,057 metric tons of contingent-owned equipment were transported by air and surface , respectively , resulting in the unforeseen additional requirements totalling $ 22,023,000 .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , the focus will be , inter alia , on improving administrative response capacity in emergency situations through the implementation of streamlined administrative procedures ; ensuring effective and timely support in the field ; developing simplified working arrangements with United Nations central services and other service providers ; finalizing a roster of emergency personnel for rapid deployment ; and developing field administrative manuals and guidelines .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The Commission could note that there is a strong need for adequate and efficient , economically viable , socially acceptable and environmentally sound transport systems , especially in developing countries where accessibility and affordability are important for the eradication of poverty , improving access to social services and access to employment opportunities . 
Efforts to establish an international enabling environment should be conducted in a spirit of partnership between developed and developing countries based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and taking into account the specific conditions of individual countries , in accordance with the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 .  
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .  
To develop and disseminate policy , legal , technical and other expertise and information that will assist countries at all stages of legal , social and economic development in controlling computer-related crime in order to ensure that security concerns do not become an obstacle to bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
In view of the increasing functions assigned to the technical body in the General Secretariat , they entrust the Secretary-General , together with the Economic and Social Council , with the task of supporting and developing that body with a view to triggering the Arab mechanisms and institutions responsible for following up joint Arab economic action .  
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
In addition , the attention of the Committee is drawn to General Assembly resolution 55 / 186 of , entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity , in paragraph 25 of which the Assembly requested that the resolution be made available to the Committee as an input to its work on the systemic issues contained in its preliminary substantive agenda . 
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights was also implementing , with support from UNICEF and from Save the Children , a prevention project entitled Protection of the basic rights of children and young people , designed to involve children and young people in collective activities at the local and national level by developing their capacities and skills as leaders and organizers .  
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1566 ( L ) , the Council considered that the ultimate goal of the work of the Commission should be the achievement of an integrated system in the collection , data processing and dissemination of international statistics by the organs and agencies of the United Nations system with special regard to the requirements of reviewing and appraising economic and social progress , taking into account the needs of the developing countries . 
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
The role of developing countries in establishing or enhancing favourable conditions for a sustainable enabling environment for both domestic and international investments , including improving the legal , economic and social environment for investment .  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Nevertheless , although the individual countries must mobilize the domestic resources that they need for their development , the high-level international event should acknowledge that some developing countries do not have a sound enough economic base to ensure that they will have the necessary production , saving and management capacity to undertake , on their own , the effort of financing poverty-reduction programmes and ensuring growth .  
In that context , the member States of WTO should not have recourse to restrictive measures and rules and should ensure that standards , technical specifications and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used to obstruct trade , that they can be complied with by developing countries and that the latter receive sufficient assistance to that end .  5.5 The developed countries and the international organizations concerned should urgently institute measures to help the developing countries to cope with fluctuations in basic prices .  
Supporting the efforts of developing countries to create open economies , with adequately supervised and well regulated financial markets , strong economic institutions , and credible and transparent economic policy frameworks .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
Under the direct supervision of the Senior Adviser to the Executive Director , the incumbent collects and analyses data pertinent to the management of the organization ; organizes and summarizes background information and prepares summary reports on specific issues analysed , and develops draft recommendations thereon ; holds consultative meetings with senior staff in UNEP and the United Nations Office at Nairobi to seek information required and to discuss work practices ; and contributes to developing and strategizing the presentation of management data ;  
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
The General Assembly recommended that , at their high-level meeting , the Economic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions consider the modalities needed to consolidate further a broader global agenda for a strengthened and stable international financial system that was responsive to the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity in the global economy ( Assembly resolution 55 / 186 , para .  24 ) .  
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :

Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,

Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
In pursuit of the objectives , the major themes and the focus areas identified in the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 , the programme for the biennium 2002-2003 embodies the ESCAP vision towards 2005 in seven interdependent and complementary subprogrammes , gearing its activities towards the alleviation of poverty ; the reinforcement of the weakening positions of developing countries arising from the process of globalization ; and detection and addressing of emerging economic and social problems and issues in the region .  
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .  
How to strengthen public-private partnerships , including through ODA leverage and the support of the international and regional financial institutions , to finance critical infrastructure projects and other priority development areas for developing countries and countries with economies in transition , not only by sharing risk with the private sector but also by improving awareness of business opportunities in these countries ?  
A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
How best to enhance cooperation between donors and recipient countries so that resources are available on a timely basis to respond to improvements in domestic policies and the ensuing opportunities for investments in areas key to the achievement of Millennium Summit goals and other internationally agreed targets , through the development of comprehensive poverty reduction strategies by developing countries and matching commitments from donors for coordinated and harmonized support ?  
How to encourage all relevant national , regional and international policy-making forums to further pursue efforts to become more accountable , responsive and transparent to public concerns , as well as to review their composition and consultation mechanisms so as to ensure fuller and deeper participation of developing countries and adequate consultation with all concerned actor and stakeholder groups ?  
Recognize the necessity of increasing appropriate preventive measures in order to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination , and the important role that international organizations , Governments , local authorities , the media , non-governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures and building confidence between different racial and ethnic groups ;  
Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Urge the United Nations , other appropriate international and regional organizations and States to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to widely disseminate the truth about Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity ;  
Also urge them to recognize that the art and technology of developing multiracial and multicultural societies and the positive example of successful multiracial societies such as some of those in the Caribbean need to be systematically studied , and therefore request the United Nations to consider establishing an international centre for multiracial studies and policy development to undertake this critical work ;  
At that time , the General Assembly confirmed the principle of adequate representation of the various legal and economic systems and of the developing and the developed world , as well as the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in preparing his analytical report on the progress made in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 55 / 188 of 20 December 2000 , to devote a separate section of the report to a global study on the illegal transfer of funds , especially funds derived from acts of corruption , and the impact of the illegal transfer of funds on economic , social and political progress , in particular in developing countries ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
[ 31 ] Experience shows that farmers both in developed and developing countries are aware of the environmental , occupational and health improvements that organic production can generate [ 32 ] , but their main motivation is still improved income in the short-term , [ 33 ] rather than concern about the environment in the longer term . 
There are several short - and medium-term measures developing countries should consider for profiting from enhanced production and export opportunities : ( i ) awareness-raising ; ( ii ) research and market studies ; ( iii ) facilitating certification and reducing its costs ; ( iv ) developing national standards ; ( v ) developing local markets ; and ( vi ) providing appropriate governmental and technical support .  
ACCs deliberations on information and communication technologies ( ICT ) focused more broadly on the contribution ICT could make in advancing some of the basic objectives that the system was endeavouring to support and advance : the integration of developing countries in the global knowledge society , and the pursuit of growth and efficiency in key sectors of the economy , in ways that serve to further the social and cultural goals of societies . 
They considered that the closest inter-agency collaboration in integrating ICT into the United Nations systems operations and in helping developing countries bridge the digital divide was essential for the system to remain effective and relevant in a rapidly changing global environment .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Notes further with satisfaction the increase in developed countries support to technical and economic cooperation among developing countries including through triangular arrangements and , in this context , encourages developing countries , regional and subregional institutions and centres of excellence , in collaboration with the Special Unit , to draw lessons from past experiences in triangular cooperation and design innovative South-South cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling greater participation by donor countries in such programmes ;  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
Encourages the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions , to document and disseminate innovative and successful practices of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , including triangular cooperation arrangements and those supported by the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
The report notes significant progress in implementing the new directions strategy , especially in areas such as the strategic orientation of TCDC activities , advancing TCDC through pivotal countries , new developments in triangular cooperation , sharing knowledge and experiences and the integration of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
He acknowledged that the increasing sophistication and complexity of TCDC activities , greater regional and inter-country cooperation among developing countries , increased resource allocations for TCDC by developing countries , greater emphasis on long-term cooperation and enhanced modalities of triangular cooperation marked the maturity of the emerging trends in the area of TCDC observed in the previous biennium .  
Taking into account that the Special Unit for TCDC is understaffed and underfunded , it must be selective in its activities , which should include : improving knowledge of all TCDC programmes worldwide ; highlighting and exchanging successful and unsuccessful development experiments ; increasing research cooperation ; developing knowledge platforms in priority areas , including increasing the usefulness of WIDE ; developing new criteria for the selection of initiatives to be supported ; and increasing the participation of new actors , e.g . , the private sector , social sector , and foundations .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
The objectives of third-country training , which takes place in a particular region where developing countries have a common base in terms of natural , social and cultural factors , are to transfer the technology and know-how of Japan in a form that is compatible with local conditions , and to promote TCDC .  
With the support of Member States , I intend to enhance the traditional preventive role of the Secretary-General in four ways : first , by increasing the use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile regions ; second , by developing regional prevention strategies with our regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies ; third , by establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention ; and fourth , by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
The Meeting adopted a document entitled Framework for cooperation in peace-building ( S / 2001 / 138 , annex I ) , in which the United Nations and regional organizations agreed on guiding principles for cooperation in this field as well as on possible cooperative activities , such as establishing peace-building units , sending joint assessment missions to the field , developing repertories of best practices and lessons learned and the joint holding of pledging conferences .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
We request the international community to strongly support poverty eradication , and welcome the ongoing consultations by the Secretary-General on the establishment of a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication to finance and realize , inter alia , the social policies and programmes of the Habitat Agenda to address challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries , especially the least developed countries , bearing in mind the voluntary nature of the contributions .  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
Support and encourage the development of national and international research infrastructure , laboratory capacity , improved surveillance systems , data collection , processing and dissemination , and training of basic and clinical researchers , social scientists , health-care providers and technicians , with a focus on the countries most affected by HIV / AIDS , particularly developing countries and those countries experiencing or at risk of rapid expansion of the epidemic ;  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
It also urges them to recognize that the art and technology of developing multiracial and multicultural societies and the positive example of successful multiracial societies such as some of those in the Caribbean region need to be systematically studied , and therefore requests the United Nations to consider establishing an international centre for multiracial and multicultural studies and policy development to undertake this critical work ;  
Urges States and financial and development institutions to mitigate the negative effects of globalization by examining how their policies and practices affect indigenous peoples ; by ensuring that their policies and practices contribute to the eradication of racism through the participation of indigenous peoples in development projects in accordance with the principle of informed consent ; by democratizing international financial institutions ; by developing enforceable codes of conduct for transnational corporations ; and by consulting with indigenous peoples in any matter that may affect their physical , spiritual or cultural integrity ;  
The Group was convinced that the industrialization strategy developed through the integrated programmes constituted one of the best means of ensuring the sustainable industrial development of developing countries and of alleviating poverty and ensuring productive employment .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
Accessibility to reliable and affordable energy was very unevenly distributed , both between countries and within countries , and many developing countries faced an urgent need to provide adequate , reliable and affordable energy services to millions of people in rural areas .  
Attention should also be paid to the joint implementation of projects ; such an approach was not only useful from the environmental standpoint but would also foster cooperation between the industrialized and developing countries , and between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , which was important for the transfer of technology and acceptance of international standards on management and production quality .  
His countrys abiding desire was to promote friendship and solidarity with the peoples of Africa and to see UNIDO fully assume its vital role in enabling a vast proportion of the worlds population , those in developing countries and countries with emerging economies , to enjoy the quality of life to which they were entitled .  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
During the current biennium , the Office of the Special Coordinator has also intensified its support to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , with a view to increasing the chances of small island developing States to find new economic opportunities in the global economy and avoid their further marginalization .  18 .  The Office of the Special Coordinator continued to provide analytical work on the economic vulnerability of small island developing States .  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food . 
Below 500-m3 , the situation becomes critical and between 100 and 200-m3 , the situation is considered a severe water shortage . 38 There is also a considerable inequality in consumption of water between developed and developing countries and over-consumption by the wealthy mirrors the under-consumption of the poor . 
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Recognizing the important dimension and role of tourism as a positive instrument towards the alleviation of poverty and the improvement of the quality of life for all people , its potential to make a contribution to economic and social development , especially of the developing countries , and its emergence as a vital force for the promotion of international understanding , peace and prosperity ,  
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
The Unit otherwise supports the work of NGOs by disseminating international human rights promotional and training material and developing a mechanism through which information collated and analysed by the Unit and East Timorese NGOs will be preserved and accessible for future use .  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
Many delegations underscored the primacy of radio as the most used and available traditional medium and expressed widespread support for the pilot project for the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations and the role of the Department in enabling developing nations to meet their information and communications needs .  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters , economic and environmental aspects of environmentally sound technologies and the identified technology needs of Parties not included in Annex II , particularly developing country Parties , as well as availability of environmentally sound technologies from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer .  
Affirming that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter , taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty ,  
Requests Annex II Parties to provide detailed information , in their national communications and / or any other relevant reports , on their existing and planned support programmes to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures ;  
Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
Recognizing that low-lying and other small island countries , countries with low-lying coastal , arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods , drought and desertification , and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change ,  
The World Bank notes that if aggregate gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in developing countries over the next 15 years were to equal the average attained during the 1990s , then progress in poverty reduction would be even slower than in scenario B , and the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day at the end of the forecast period would be only marginally lower than in 1998 .  
These should be , and in many cases are already being , applied by national Governments ( including in developing their international policies and objectives ) to ensure , through exercising good governance , that their citizens are involved in decision-making , that their citizens rights are protected and that all areas of government are sensitized to human rights obligations and goals .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
While programmes intended to draw foreign investment , such as those involving the creation of economic industrial zones , have the advantage of encouraging economic growth in developing countries , they are accompanied by considerable social costs , involving , for example , massive violations of the fundamental rights of employees , who pay dearly for them .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
It is vital to restore North-South dialogue with two fundamental objectives : promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development as the priorities of cooperation and correcting the imbalances in the operation of the international economic system , which places developing countries at a clear disadvantage in their relationship with developed countries .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
The construction services sector is a fundamental economic activity which permeates all sectors of the economy : it is an instrument for employment creation and a tool for upgrading welfare ; it has a major role to play in providing basic and safe infrastructure achieving social and economic development objectives in developing countries ; and local firms and professionals should be fully involved in this process .  
As the implementation of the UR had not been satisfactory to Moroccos interests , it considered that the trade and support measures adopted by developed countries should be significantly reduced , particularly as agriculture constituted the principal economic activity of a large number of developing countries .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
In the long term , the agricultural production base of developing countries should be improved , and in the short term , bilateral and multilateral food aid schemes should be strengthened .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
The representative of Singapore , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said the Expert Meeting had provided a unique opportunity for national experts from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to share their experience and to express their views and concerns in an international forum on the impact of AD / CVD actions .  
A possible strategy is to establish such a capacity gradually , by assisting in developing requisite training / pedagogical material and by providing assistance in course delivery in a developing country on a regional basis jointly with local professional associations ( freight forwarders , exporters etc . ) and / or academic institutions .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
FDI has become the single most important type of capital inflow to developing countries , accounting for about two thirds of all resource flows during the 1990s . 2 The fastest growth in all types of financial flows to developing countries and transition economies over the past decade was in portfolio equity investments , which rose sixfold to reach an annual average of more than $ 40-billion at the end of the decade . 
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
She called on the international community to commit additional financial resources and technical assistance for capacity-building in the physical infrastructure as well as for making available improved services and harmonized processes between the landlocked and transit developing countries .  
On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
With regard to the role of international agreements , he pointed out that so far recognition of the importance of technology transfer for developing countries was only formal in nature , expressed solely through the existence of the relevant international and regional arrangements , but that further refinement of those arrangements was needed in order to facilitate the practical possibilities of their actual implementation .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
Given the attention being paid to international norms for products entering trade , it was an important step that development partners committed to providing assistance to least developed countries in developing infrastructure to ensure quality control and conformity to international standards of their products and to avoiding taking unilateral action in a manner inconsistent with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
One of the new posts would be dedicated to developing and assisting in the use of visual tools for presentations , briefings and reports , and for preparing and updating maps related to all areas of interest of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ; the other operations officer would be responsible for maximizing the use of existing online information sources and for maintaining and improving the information flow of documents and reports between the Situation Centre and the other units of the Department .  
The Section will be responsible for mid - and long-term planning , including succession planning , developing mission modules / templates , determining staffing tables and levels , anticipating future skills requirements , analysing and monitoring human resource trends , identifying new sources of recruitment , and managing the civilian rapid deployment capability .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
The Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit will be considerably strengthened and is intended to be at the heart of a new system by which the Organization learns from its peacekeeping experience , developing policies , procedures and related operational tools that are incorporated into the planning and conduct of both ongoing and future missions .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
Appeals to the international community , United Nations bodies , international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to allocate substantial new and additional resources , including through the new global fund to fight HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , launched by the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries at its Genoa Summit in 2001 and by the Secretary-General , for developing countries , particularly in Africa , with a view to enabling them to fully implement the Plan of Action adopted in Abuja for the Roll Back Malaria initiative ;  
The Assembly made a number of recommendations to Governments and Member States , in particular to countries of origin and destination , calling on them to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States .  
Today , encouraging and promoting international cooperation to combat infectious diseases , which are again an emerging global threat to all developed or developing countries is proved to be more essential than ever .  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions , should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The analytical studies confirmed that weak infrastructures and inefficient transit operations result in high transport costs and are major impediments to trade expansion and sustainable development in many landlocked and transit developing countries .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
Furthermore , the astronomical costs involved in developing a space-based defence system , taken together with those incurred to counter such a move , would inevitably result in heightened strategic competition and greater mutual vulnerability and further deepen the global economic crisis .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
In accordance with paragraph 2 of the resolution , our country is making steady and active efforts to prevent the use , in violation of decisions made by the relevant United Nations organs , of unilateral measures of economic and political coercion inconsistent with the norms of international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations as a means of applying pressure on independent developing States .  
The United Nations and other organizations , whether of an international or regional character , have adopted an enormous number of resolutions condemning the use of unilateral coercive economic measures because of the great damage they do to the economies of the developing countries and their negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a just and non-discriminatory trading system .  
The Commission on Human Rights itself has stated that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has an adverse effect on the social and humanitarian situation of developing countries .  
For this reason , the Government of the Republic of Mali believes that the international community should adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and are contrary to the basic principles of the international trading system .  
However , favourable external conditions were equally necessary ; the current international economic system must be reformed to meet the challenges of globalization and growing interdependence among countries and made more equitable by increasing the decision-making power of the developing countries .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
His Government would be giving top priority in the coming four years to creating an information society based on science and new technologies , by , inter alia , introducing computer education for students , teachers and civil servants , and using computer networks to centralize access to government services ; developing a long-term science and technology strategy ; promoting electronic business ; and using an integrated communications network to fight organized crime , drug-dealing and illegal immigration .  
That had been particularly evident during negotiations on the agenda for the forthcoming World Trade Organization ( WTO ) Ministerial Conference , for , despite high-level pronouncements that trade should promote development , the negotiations had revolved around the need to secure additional benefits for developed countries as a precondition for discussing issues that were critical to the development of most developing countries . 
In that connection he stressed the need for an open , equitable , predictable , non-discriminatory and rule-based multilateral trading system and expressed the hope that the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would achieve a new consensus model that took into account the needs and priorities of the developing world . 
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
She stressed the need to strengthen normative , legislative and organizational frameworks in the interests of a stable and predictable world economy , adding that one way to facilitate the developing countries integration into that economy was to provide sufficient development funding ; the International Conference on Financing for Development could play an important role in that .  
Because of the many obstacles that developing landlocked countries faced in international trade , especially high transport costs which made their exports expensive and less competitive , special attention should be given to the interests of those countries in the next round of trade negotiations .  
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
He expressed the hope that the outcomes of the Fourth World Tourism Organization Ministerial Conference and the World Summit on Sustainable Development could provide help to developing countries in their efforts , inter alia , to feed the poor and provide shelter ; halt and reverse the spread of HIV / AIDS ; provide safe drinking water ; and offer employment to the millions of unemployed youth .  
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
The theme of the dialogue , entitled Responding to globalization : facilitating the integration of developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century , was considered to be particularly important and timely in the context of the current global economic slowdown , and emphasized the urgent need for poverty eradication strategies .  
This required revival of global economic growth , in a sustainable and more equitable manner , coupled with open markets and technical assistance for developing countries , and the removal of barriers to free exchange and investment within the developing world .  
In order to promote a more equitable distribution of the benefits of globalization , the adequate representation and broad and meaningful participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting should be realized .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
He reaffirmed his countrys full support for the recommendations contained in the outcome documents of the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly , which had enhanced the international communitys awareness of the nature of the social and developmental problems facing the worlds peoples , particularly in developing and least developed countries .  
Official and unofficial assistance to developing countries must be increased , their debt burden must be alleviated and the conditions governing their access to technology for peaceful uses and the access of their products to global markets must be eased to enable those countries to carry out appropriate reforms of their social and development institutions , diversify their sources of national income , create job opportunities for their nationals , provide education , health and social welfare services and combat chronic and epidemic diseases , especially HIV / AIDS .  
On instructions from His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , to make the individual in that State the pivot and the purpose of national development endeavours , the State had adopted legislation , policies and plans aimed at developing national human resources through the development and modernization of educational , health and cultural institutions and the establishment of centres to train young people and develop their scientific and technological skills in accordance with national development needs .  
He hoped that the Committees discussions at the current session would help to promote the role of the United Nations in designing and coordinating development policies and programmes in developing countries and to revitalize an approach to international development and social cooperation that was based on equality among peoples and the right of States to choose their own development course and achieve a better future for their societies in accordance with their independent national policies and interests .  
First of all , an equitable international economic order should be established which did not blindly impose globalization on developing countries but instead included an equitable trading system , reform of the international financial institutions and a solution to the external debt problem .  
Austria congratulated the Commission secretariat on organizing a Colloquium on Privately Financed Infrastructure in Vienna in July and endorsed the initiative to establish a Working Group to draft a core model law , because a legislative and regulatory framework for infrastructure projects would send a reassuring signal to all potential private investors and might help to attract private investment for infrastructure projects in developing States .  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
It further urged the United Nations to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to disseminate widely a balanced and objective presentation of Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .  
Funding for those activities should be sufficient , secure and stable , be provided on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and be commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
It was therefore the role of the International Conference on Financing for Development to provide developing countries with realistic advice enabling them to reformulate domestic policies and review regulatory constraints that were currently hampering the growth of the private sector and discouraging foreign investment .  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
Commending the positive and constructive role played by refugee-hosting countries and recognizing at the same time the heavy burden borne by some , particularly developing countries and countries with economies in transition , as well as the protracted nature of many refugee situations and the absence of timely and safe solutions ,  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
Urges concerned Governments , in particular those of the countries of origin and destination , to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States , and to establish and maintain continuing dialogues to facilitate the exchange of information ;  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
The endeavour to reverse the marginalization of developing countries , to promote their sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to facilitate their integration into the world economy had led the international community to search for integral and balanced global arrangements .  
They had been asked to establish an environment conducive to capital flows , yet foreign direct investment flows to the developing countries were continually shrinking and were expected to diminish by another 6 per cent in 2001 , especially since the climate in the developed countries was more uncertain , the risks were greater and investment returns were lower . 
The report also stated that , according to preliminary estimates , the developing world would experience slower growth in its export volumes in 2001 , and that growth forecasts had been revised downwards even prior to the terrorist attacks ; the growth of volume of world trade was expected to drop to 4 per cent from 12 per cent in 2000 , and the global volume of imports and exports would have difficulty withstanding the declines in the prices of primary commodities and of manufactured exports .  
Recommends that , within existing budgetary resources or , where necessary , with the help of extrabudgetary or voluntary resources , the concerned specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system provide to the bodies responsible for the advancement of women , information that would enable them to undertake a precise and in-depth analysis of the situation of older women , including developing , if necessary , specific new methods for data collection ;  
Recognizing the important dimension and role of tourism as a positive instrument towards the alleviation of poverty and the improvement of the quality of life for all people , its potential to make a contribution to economic and social development , especially of the developing countries , and its emergence as a vital force for the promotion of international understanding , peace and prosperity ,  
The report of the Secretary-General contained many useful proposals designed to strengthen the operational activities of the United Nations system , but it was important to ensure that the fundamental characteristics of those activities , namely their universal , voluntary and grant-based nature , as well as their ability to respond to the needs of developing countries in a flexible and timely manner , were maintained .  
He outlined the main activities undertaken by the secretariat , where priority continued to be given to least developed countries , and the progress achieved with regard to the utilization of developing countries capacities in the implementation of technical cooperation and with respect to the financial sustainability of selected technical cooperation programmes .  
Reiterates its call upon all relevant funding institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as regional funding institutions and non-governmental organizations , to support , as appropriate , the efforts being made for the development of the renewable energy sector in developing countries on the basis of environment-friendly renewable sources of energy of demonstrated viability , while taking fully into account the development structure of energy-based economies of developing countries , and to assist in the attainment of the levels of investment necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
They included the widening economic gap between countries of the South and countries of the North ; the existence in the countries of the North of a labour market capable of absorbing labour from countries of the South in specialized areas of technology ; the economic recession in developing countries ; increasing unemployment and inflation ; and the expansion of political conflicts , including in Africa , that increased insecurity and poverty .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
As a primary sponsor of that draft resolution , South Africa is particularly pleased that the Secretariat managed to source from existing budgetary provisions adequate funding for the conference servicing required for the first biennial meeting of States contemplated in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution , as well as for the meetings of a group of experts to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument for tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , referred to in paragraph 10 .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening the international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction ;  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to seek views of Member States on the desirability of convening a high-level policy consultation at the governmental level with a view to setting priorities and developing critical strategies that would meet the manifold challenges faced by rural women ;  
The purpose of the council was to develop a comprehensive national programme to take advantage of the peaceful applications of the use of outer space and to attain the technological and development objectives of the State , including the adoption of satellite technology for the study of desert regions , while training scientific personnel , developing an Egyptian space programme and using space technology and its applications in the development of local industry .  
If international cooperation failed to expand , it would be difficult for many developing countries to create a reliable scientific and educational base for the sustainable development of space technology .  
Stresses the need for partnership among Governments of the affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized companies to promote training in , access to and use of technologies to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters , and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed ;  
Recognizing that , while it is the primary responsibility of States to attain economic and social development and to achieve the development and poverty eradication goals as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , the international community should support the efforts of the developing countries to eradicate poverty and ensure basic social protection and to promote an enabling international environment ,  
Also recognizes the critical need for countries to undertake economic , institutional and regulatory reforms to support wide trade liberalization and to create an enabling environment in which trade can truly serve as an engine for economic growth and development and , in this regard , calls upon the international community to continue to support the capacity-building efforts of developing countries , taking into account their national circumstances ;  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20 / 20 initiative , which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,

Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development in support of the efforts of Governments to ensure , inter alia , full and equal access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology , as well as full and equal participation in all decision-making ;  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,

To this end , we have been including the subject of civic education in primary and secondary school curricula , and we have been developing large-scale civic campaigns to provide education at the national level about democratic values .  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,

Recognizing that the main role of UNIDO lies in providing technical cooperation to the developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition , in relation to those support functions in which the Organization has a competitive advantage , such as strengthening of industrial capacities and cleaner sustainable industrial development and also giving assistance to those countries to participate effectively in international trade ,  
Encourages the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development in support of the efforts of Governments to ensure , inter alia , increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in all decision-making ;

Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
Recalling the Millennium Declaration , which recognizes the special needs and problems of landlocked developing countries and urges both bilateral and multilateral donors to increase financial and technical assistance to this group of countries to meet their special development needs and to help them overcome the impediments of geography by improving their transit transport systems ,  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,

Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .

In the coming 5 years , the step of attracting investments should be accelerated ; industry structures , product structures and enterprise structures will be gradually adjusted .  " Three transformations " are to be realized : to immediately develop from single export processing to comprehensive functionality , to transform from a focus on traditional industries into focusing on developing of the new technology industry , and to transform from a focus on scattered , small-scale investment attraction into actively introducing large industry &amp; trade projects from foreign multinational companies and groups .  
In the past few years , scientific and technological achievements that have come out of researching , manufacturing and developing have mainly been new crystalline material , digital color TV with picture-in-picture function , UPS series products , bank POS systems , nationwide computer-controlled cement composite bag bagging machines , medium voltage switches , etc .  
The processing trade is developing comparatively quickly , with more than 200 state-owned enterprises in the whole region have joined the ranks of the processing trade , having equal shares with foreign funded enterprises in both number of enterprises and recorded contract value .  Moreover , their production and operation methods have gradually transformed from simple materials processing to fine , in-depth processing of high-tech and high added value commodities .  
At present , nearly 70 large projects , with 10-million US dollars being invested in each , have already spread out in a belt standing tall with more than 100 square kilometers along the 20 kilometer Gold Coast of Ningbo 's Beilun district , forming a recently emerging large industrial economic belt with leading industries such as petrochemical , iron and steel and developing subsidiary industries such as electric power , machinery , electronics , light industry and textile , building materials , plastic cement , etc .

By further increasing cooperation with overseas , and actively introducing foreign capital , technology and management experience , it accelerated the development and utilization of China 's limited oil and natural gas resources in order to make it meet the developing needs of China 's national economy .  
In recent years , China has been paying close attention to development of the natural gas industry , and has drafted a development strategy for the land-based petroleum industry of " stabilizing the east , developing the west , and increasing oil and gas " .

The funds raised by " Shenye Holding Company " this time will primarily be invested in developing intercity bus service , national car rental network , and in the existing real estate projects , to build up an integrated enterprise with Hong Kong as a base and Shenzhen as a business focus .  
At the same time Yuan Chen emphasized that economic development among the developing countries is still not even .  The economy in many countries is still very fragile .  Their debts are still heavy and the poverty situation is worsening .  In the spirit of development and co-operation , the international community should adopt realistic and feasible measures to help these developing countries solve these problems .  
He pointed out that in the United Nations affairs , China has been consistently abiding by the goals and principles set forth in the United Nations Charter , seriously fulfilling its responsibilities , actively supporting various kinds of United Nations work done in the spirit of the Charter , and has made constructive efforts and positive contributions to maintaining world peace , seeking the just and reasonable resolution of major international and regional issues , protecting the interests of developing countries , and the promotion of equal co-operation and understanding among various countries .  
Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Huaqiu Liu held talks with Kamyao here on the 29th .  Both parties exchanged opinions in depth regarding further developing bilateral relations and also international and regional problems that were of common concern , and they achieved widespread agreement .  
It marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and North and South , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order . 
For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
Actually , in view of the fact that the " TSEA " has directly undermined efforts exerted by both China and the United States since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1979 in improving and developing their bilateral relations , that it has violated the principled stand on " one China , " and that it has directly interfered in China 's internal affairs , it will definitely aggravate tension in the Taiwan Strait , intensify the regional arms race and further push Taiwan to war rather than protect Taiwan 's security .  
The practice of the half century since World War II has proven that the moves of GATT and the WTO in achieving big multilateral reductions in tariffs and nontariff measures , actively spurring the liberalization of international trade , enhancing the transparency of members ' trade policies , resolving trade disputes , and accepting large numbers of developing countries and regions to take part in the multilateral trade setup have played an extremely important role in expanding international trade and promoting world economic development .  
Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
In order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .  
During the UN Trade Development Council meeting , representatives of the international organizations and developing nations strongly called for reforming the current international rules and regulations , establishing a just and reasonable international political and economic order , and narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor .

and carry out internal restructuring of overall agriculture , by " returning farmland to forest " in mountain areas , " returning farmland to grassland " in pastoral areas , and " returning farmland to fishery " in lake areas ; that is , we should abandon the method of developing agriculture and grain production at the cost of sacrificing the ecological environment , and open up a broad space for increasing new products that suit the demand of the international market and have competitive advantage .  
Today , our army has developed a basic system for its weaponry and equipment of a new generation , which enjoys a relatively intact structure and a relatively strong capacity of developing complete sets of weaponry and equipment , thus providing strong weaponry and technological support for our army to enhance its defense and combat capabilities under modern technological , especially high-tech , conditions .  
Facing the new situations in domestic China and overseas and the new challenges of the new century and new millennium , it is a must to further define clearly the thinking about developing the economy , adjust in a timely manner the economic structure , and uphold all along the thinking of science and technology being the primary productive force , so as to bring about sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy .  
Just as an article published recently by " Renmin Ribao " stated , quickening China 's " entry into WTO " negotiations and enabling China to accede to WTO on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for China in developing a socialist market economy and a need for China in furthering her reform and opening up .  
We need to focus on the key strategic plans for national economic development , mobilizing the advantage of overseas Chinese resources to the service of the strategies of revitalizing China through science and education and sharply developing western China .  
Since the founding of new China , the party and government have attached great importance to developing the people 's education and devoted great efforts to it ; there have been tremendous developments in China 's education and large numbers of outstanding talented people have been trained for socialist construction .  
Dai Xianglong said : Implementing the strategy of developing the western regions is an important plan for restructuring the economy and promoting the coordinated development of regional economies .  It is an important measure for increasing domestic demand and promoting the sustained , rapid and coordinated development of the national economy .  It is also an important opportunity for the restructuring of bank credits and promoting the development of banking .  
By cooperating with and serving others , Chongqing should solve well the problem of redundant industrial structure that is likely to occur during the course of developing the Western Region . By serving others , it should strengthen itself , attain the goal of " striving to turn Chongqing into an economic center on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang put forward by General Secretary Jiang Zemin , and join the western provinces and autonomous regions in building a great economic circle of sustainable development in the Western Region .  
Forces will be concentrated on key basic research projects and key projects , such as digital high division television , broadband high-speed information network , industrial automation , civil airplanes , and civil satellites and on developing newly rising industries . 
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
While fully developing the material productive forces , our party should attach great importance to the " cultural productive forces , " which are high-level productive forces ; the value and influence produced by such high-level productive forces will have a direct bearing on every aspect of our work and on our party 's ideological and political work in the new period .  
Meanwhile , they are also conducive to enhancing understanding , expanding common understanding , turning the party and government policies and principles into the majority of people 's conscious action , discovering and pooling the wisdom and experience of the masses , relying on the people to tide over difficulties and resolve problems , harmonizing the relationship in distribution of interests , eliminating social contradictions , and safeguarding and developing the political situation featured by unity and stability .  
Hu Jintao emphasized that the key to seizing and using well the opportunity of the great development of the west to speed up economic and social development lies in doing a good job in building the party organizations at all levels ; in particular , the leading cadres at all levels must play a model role , firmly advance in the forefront of emancipating and developing the productive forces and promoting the building of the two civilizations , and unite and lead the masses to work hard together .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
To represent the demand for developing advanced productive forces , to represent the advancing direction of progressive culture , and to represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people , these three are a closely linked and dialectically unified whole .  They represent the essential demands of socialism , and the line running through them represent the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  We must earnestly comprehend Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech concerning the �t hree represents .  
Only by continuously developing socialist culture and continuously satisfying the masses growing need for spiritual and cultural life can we provide a powerful spiritual drive and guarantee the development of productive forces .  
work closely in line with the orientation of developing the capital 's economy ; obtain new edges through scientific and technological , structural , and managerial innovations ; and lay a solid foundation for being the first in the whole nation to materialize modernization .  
In line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " Beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .  We should resolutely implement the spirit of the official , written reply of the State Council ;  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
In his report Li Peng also discussed the main tasks for this year and next in better relying on the people 's deputies to do a good job in Standing Committee work , unfolding thorough and protracted education in socialist democracy and legal system , further developing a new situation in exchanges and cooperation with foreign and international parliaments and assemblies , and continuing to step up the building of the Standing Committee itself .  
A responsible official of Chongqing Municipality indicated today that this municipality will seize the historical opportunity of extensively developing western regions to build itself into an economic center on the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and will , at the same time , adopt effective measures to ensure the smooth fulfillment of the task on relocating the residents at the Three Gorges reservoir areas .  
Third , it is necessary to speed up the pace of scientific and technological development by giving full play to the human resource and technology advantages in the eastern coastal areas , applying modern technologies to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech and new technology industries , and establishing innovation mechanisms in the light of the laws that govern technological and economic development . 
The scientific and technological revolution represented by information technology is developing rapidly ; the cycle of renovation of knowledge and technology is shrinking substantially ; and achievements of science and technology are being transformed into real productive forces at an unprecedented scale and speed .  
A new round of structural adjustment is being carried out throughout the world ; new - and high-technology industry and newly emerging industry are developing robust ; intellectual economy has raged like a storm , and world economic competition has become increasingly intense .  
Since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world was launched , our party has asserted , in accordance with the theory on China being on the initial stage of socialism , that liberating and developing the productive forces is the essential demand and fundamental task of socialism and proceeded to formulate its own basic line , basic program , and a set of principles and policies , with the stress on unwavering adherence to the party 's basic line , focusing on unwavering adherence to economic construction being the center of all endeavors .  
The main reason why the United States produces an annual country report on human rights practices , heedless of the strong opposition of other countries , assumes the air of a " judge of human rights , " and insists on interfering in affairs under the jurisdiction of other countries is mainly to use this as a pretext for putting political pressure on other countries , especially developing and socialist countries , in a bid to change their political and social systems .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
Zeng Peiyan suggested : We should devote major efforts to advancing education for improving the overall quality of students ; accelerating the fostering of qualified personnel ; deepening structural reform in the fields of science , technology , and education ; strengthening technological innovation ; developing high technology ; achieving industrialization ; accelerating the establishment of a state innovation system ; nurturing enterprises into a genuine mainstay in technological innovation ; and making science , technology , and education serve economic construction even better .  
The surging tide of acquisitions and mergers among international enterprises is breeding yet another major industrial transfer .  After accepting the market for labor-intensive industries in the 1970s , developing countries may have to brace themselves again for the full-fledged onslaught of multinational companies .  
Now that Guangdong has built up considerable economic strength , how should it grasp the new opportunity and improve its overall economic quality through positive involvement in full-fledged competition in the international market on the basis of consolidating and developing the existing economy is a new task .  
In other words , they attempt to bring developing countries to their strategic track and force developing countries to facilitate their hegemonist goal and to be their dependencies .  However , most developing countries have the bitter experience of being bullied and humiliated by Western big powers , thus they extremely treasure their national sovereignty and dignity and , of course , resolutely oppose and struggle against the so-called " human rights standard " and the " values " foisted on them by the current hegemonist powers .  
The telegram says : In the past 45 years , under the leadership of the Lao People 's Revolutionary Party , the people of all nationalities in Laos won a victory in national and democratic revolution , established the Lao People 's Democratic Republic , and continuously made new achievements in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty and developing national undertakings .  In particular , since the initiation of the innovation and opening up drive , Laos has made ceaseless progress in all undertakings and made noticeable achievements in continuously improving the people 's living standards .  
Zhu Rongji said : Mr President is the Chinese people 's old friend .  We satisfactorily see that in the last 36 years since China and the Republic of Congo forged diplomatic ties , our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations have been steadily and smoothly developing .  Sound cooperation full of positive results has been carried out in the political , economic and trade , public health , and educational fields .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
The shock wave evoked in China by an event tens of millions of li away from China illustrated that China , which as a permanent member nation of the UN Security Council and a gradually rising developing nation , has assumed a major responsibility in regional and global prosperity and security , and that world peace and stability are required in China 's reform and opening up .  
For example also , the overwhelming majority of China 's analysts held that the so-called " human rights being higher than sovereignty " is only a used by a hegemonist country to promote power politics .  The vast numbers of developing nations will not be able to achieve independent political and economic development and human rights in the modern sense if they depart from the framework of sovereignty and the protection of international law .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
Only by truly fulfilling the " three represents " can the party lead the people in developing social productive forces , flourishing socialist culture with Chinese characteristics , and constantly improving the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
However , while liberating and developing social productive forces , we must also handle numerous issues about production relations and superstructures , especially those issues in the ideological and cultural realms and must let the building of material civilization and the building of spiritual civilization coordinately develop .  
Only by developing productive forces and flourishing socialist culture can we provide powerful material and spiritual bases for realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .  It is hoped that both sides will continue to make efforts and do effective work , thus continuously advancing bilateral friendship and cooperation and achieving more concrete cooperation results to bring benefits to both peoples .  
Recently , the DPRK has actively carried out diplomatic activities ; worked hard to improve and strengthen its relations with the neighboring countries ; readjusted its diplomatic strategies towards the United States and Japan in a timely fashion ; expanded its exchanges with the developing countries ; and further normalized its relations with the western countries with excellent results .  
[ Li Dingfan ] Our country 's nuclear industry was established in 1955 .  In the past 40 years or so , the industry developed tremendously from scratch and succeeded in developing " two bombs and one boat , " thus enabling China to become one of the nuclear countries in the world , smashing the nuclear monopoly and blackmail by the imperialists and hegemonists , greatly boosting its comprehensive national strength , and making tremendous contributions in maintaining world peace .  
[ Li Dingfan ] In the new century , the CNNC 's entire line of thinking on development is to further cut the new development path of " integrating military and civilian production , developing nuclear energy power generation , readjusting the structure , giving prominence to efficiency , strengthening management , and invigorating the nuclear industry with science and technology . "  
The publication and implementation of " the Provisions " indicate that China has advanced a big step in developing legal system governing public security and border patrol .  They have very important significance in demonstrating China 's efforts to strengthen the administration over vessels along the coasts , to prevent and crack down on marine crimes , and to safeguard social order along coastal regions and at sea .  
However , we are principled on developing Sino-US relations ; that is , we should strictly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations , especially the principle of mutual respect of each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
The central government has put an end to its past practice of uniform and direct central management and control by allowing various localities and departments to adopt flexible or varied production or operation modes ; has called for developing a superior economy by suiting measures to the local conditions or opportunities ; has urged all sectors to carry out economic accounting and ensure economic efficiency ;  
Finally , the " Opinion " calls on local people 's governments at all levels and the departments concerned to make overall plans for developing social welfare undertakings , set reasonable work targets , and avoid such practices as acting arbitrarily , rushing headlong into mass action , making overlapping efforts , and wasting resources .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
To make static targets moveable , the task force engaged in tackling major technical hurdles worked without a letup for several months , made do with whatever was available , and thus succeeded in developing movable false tanks , false armored cars , and other false targets .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
It is necessary to further clearly define the major objectives , basic tasks and major principles and policies for developing the minority nationalities areas , and promote population , resources , environmental , as well as economic and social development in a coordinated and stage-by-stage manner and with an objective in mind . "  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
We have attached great importance to developing good neighborly and friendly relations , as well as relations of all-round cooperation , with Vietnam ; and are willing to make common efforts with Vietnam 's new leading collective in opening up a brighter future prospect for the relations between our two parties and two countries .  
Those who truly base themselves on reality and on the long future have set their vision on some feasible aspects .  While improving their own techniques and management , they have established the systems of authentication , distribution , and security , in addition to developing in the direction of professionalization .  They have aimed at the identified market targets and actively opened up market space , and made a link between enterprises and enterprises and between enterprises and consumers with networks .  
Our stand of opposing " Taiwan independence " has won the support of all the Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots , and met with general approval in the international community .  It has also hit the sore point of " Taiwan independence " elements .  Therefore , some diehard " Taiwan independence " elements are not willing to see the cross-strait relations developing in the direction of the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation because of their natural instinct of " Taiwan independence . "  
He noted that for decades , this movement has adhered to the aims and principles of independence , autonomy , non-alignment , and non-grouping , always devoting its efforts to defending the interests of the many developing countries , and actively promoting the establishment of a new just and rational international political and economic order , in an outstanding effort to promote peace and development for the human race .  
During President Jiang Zemin 's trip to Japan in 1998 , he jointly formulated with Japanese leaders the fundamental policy on developing Japanese-Chinese ties gearing toward the future .  It indicated that Japanese-Chinese ties entered a new phase , and that both countries have established bilateral ties which were varied and mutually interdependent .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
Our experience for more than 20 years has proved that these measures and actions in afforestation and improving the environment conform to the reality that our country faces arduous tasks in environmental construction and lacks funds .  Through these measures and actions , the socialist system 's advantages are given full play , and at the same time , people from around the whole country have a heightened awareness of the need for afforestation .  These measures and actions are a lively implementation of patriotism and are worthy of our careful summing up and further perfecting and developing .  
He pointed out that the Chinese Government attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Cuba . The two countries ' relations have developed smoothly in recent years .  Particularly since the realization of the mutual visit between President Jiang Zemin and President Castro , the cooperation level between the two sides has risen ; cooperation areas have constantly expanded ; and the Sino-Cuban relationship has entered a period of comprehensive development .  This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relationship between China and Cuba .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have been healthily and rapidly developing .  Our cooperation in the political , economic , trade , scientific , technological , agricultural , and cultural fields has achieved gratifying results .  
The building of party character and honest government has been a clear success , and we have formulated a complete set of guiding ideologies , basic principles , leadership system , and work pattern to fight corruption .  We have introduced a series of laws and regulations on honest government , and we have to different degrees solved some of the more serious problems the masses are most concerned about .  The struggle to treat the symptoms and the causes of corruption is developing in depth and is gaining breadth .  
Our Chinese ancestors settled on the Taiwan Island a long time ago .  They contributed a lot of hard work developing the land , and carried out unremitting and moving struggles defending this land against foreign aggressors .  
In short , as a result of 20 years of efforts , we have initially established the basic framework of a fiscal and taxation system suited to the demand of developing socialist market economy , and have achieved notable success in fiscal reforms and development .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
It should be pointed out that the noticeable difference between the developing countries and developed countries is that due to being exploited and controlled by colonialism and imperialism for a long time in the past and now being at a low level of economic development , the vast number of developing countries are bound to place their state sovereignty , survival rights , and development rights at priority positions .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
If the US Government could be introspective regarding their failure , it would not be difficult to discover that the politicizing of human rights is wishful thinking , and has already caused a lot of countries in the world , especially developing countries , to be strongly disapproving .  And it is also an obstacle to all kinds of economic development by the United Nations . This affects dialogue and cooperation about human rights between all member countries .  
We are happy to see that Turkey 's people , with their own capable hands , obtained an outstanding accomplishment while in the midst of the process of building their own country .  The society is unceasingly progressing , the economy is rapidly developing , the living standard of the people is increasing day by day , and Turkey has already become a spectacular country in the international community .  
Empirical evidence shows that the peoples of ancient nations , as long as they positively bring into play the profound advantages accumulated from their culture and diligent , brave traditions , can also absorb modern scientific culture 's inventions and creations , keenly innovate , and unceasingly strengthen themselves , and thereby definitely have the capability , while on the road to developing themselves , of writing a new chapter that accords with the demands of the age .  
The Chinese Government attaches importance to developing long-term , stable friendly relations and cooperation with Greece and is ready to work together with the Greek side in further expanding and deepening cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , cultural , and various other fields to constantly score new , great successes .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational , and new international political and economic order .  
On this globe we live , if rich countries become richer and poor countries become poorer , if one side continues to accumulate wealth and the poverty of the other side aggravates , if some big powers interfere in internal affairs of other countries everywhere and practice hegemony and power politics by relying on their powerful economy , science and technology and military strength , and if many developing countries can not take part in international affairs on an equal footing and receive unfair treatment or even groundless humiliation , the world will not have peace and development .  
China and South Africa are two important developing countries in Asia and Africa and share a common goal in safeguarding developing countries ' rights and interests and promoting the establishment of a peaceful , stable , fair , rational and new international political and economic order .  
However , from a host of startling incidents that have been exposed , we have seen cases of many Falungong followers concealing their ailments , refusing to consult doctors , missing the chance of treatment , and ending up dead or disabled ; we have also seen cases of many Falungong practitioners believing in Li Hongzhi 's heretical arguments and fallacies , developing mental disorder , causing bodily harm to themselves or committing suicide , or even killing others , thus destroying family peace and social stability .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
As far as social supervision is concerned , what is most crucial is that supervision departments should earnestly change their guiding ideology for developing the capital market , really proceed from giving play to market functions and improving the efficiency of the distribution of capital resources , strengthen supervision over the " openness , justice and fairness " of market , reduce unnecessary interference , adopt measures to gradually release and curb market " bubbles , " and reduce the overall risk of market .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .  But this figure is still below the level of the world 's maritime economy , which accounts for 7 percent of the world 's total economic aggregates .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
[ Liu Shijin ] After we started the reform and opening-up drive , we reexamined and adjusted our previous strategy of giving priority to developing the heavy industry .  This resulted in the pattern of industrial development with emphasis on the textile and other light industries during the early and middle periods of the 80 ' s of the 20th century .  
Given the new condition of opening to the outside world and vigorously developing socialist market economy , leading cadres should , just like a lotus , stick to the revolutionary integrity , keep honest and clean , and always be a loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people so that they can make due contribution to further improving party style , strengthening administrative honesty , and opposing corruption .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
While vigorously developing agriculture , the DPRK party and government have actively developed the agricultural sideline production and encouraged the people to plant mulberries to raise silkworms and to raise fish and pigs with a view to improving the people 's consumption .  In the meantime , the party and government have launched a nationwide lecture on popular science knowledge to disseminate the knowledge of growing cash crops and breeding animals with economic value .  
On the world political arena , China , as one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and the largest developing country , has a weighty international status and a positive , major impact on peace and development for mankind , which have won high international dignity and honor for itself .  
This is not only beneficial to stimulating trade and international resources , but is also helpful in alleviating the contradiction of domestic oversupply .  It is beneficial toward developing an economy of scale and will help to effectively attract advanced foreign technology and management experience .  Moreover , direct overseas investment will be beneficial in terms of employee training and introduction .  
China has always devoted its efforts to international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy , advocating efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons .  But we should not ignore the legitimate right of all countries , particularly developing countries , to use nuclear energy peacefully , even less so applying a double standard , to exploit anti-proliferation as the means for restricting and obstructing cooperation by all countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy .  
Foreign army materials show that the Russian Army recently formulated a basic concept for developing a command system at the current stage .  An important aspect was cutting back and readjusting fixed command facilities and building a field campaign command center equipped with various functions and capable of rapid response .  
At that time our country 's capacity for screening chemical compounds was less than one-tenth of that of a single US research institute .  Despite the circumstances , members of the project group were determined to carry out innovative research .  Eventually they triumphed over their powerful adversaries , smashed the preoccupation that " developing countries are unable to develop new drugs " and captured the world 's commanding height of developing the anti-malaria drug .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
At the simple , clean , and tidy office of the secretary of the regional party committee , Wang Lequan sat side by side and chatted with this reporter .  He emphatically pointed out : Since the founding of new China , the three generations of leaders of the party Central Committee have been very much concerned about Xinjiang , and they have repeatedly stressed that Xinjiang can maintain lasting political stability only by developing its economy faster than surrounding countries and bringing prosperity to the people .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
The Party 's basic lines have embodied in a centralized manner the Party 's nature of being advanced , of reflecting the fundamental interests and wishes of the broad number of the masses , of meeting the requirements for developing the social productive forces in contemporary China , and of powerfully pushing forward the development and the progress of socialist material and spiritual civilization 's construction .  
( 9 ) Development of human society from low level stage to higher level is a kind of " natural history process " .  And transiting from socialism to communism is the ultimate goal and necessary result for developing modern social productive forces , which is also the supreme social ideal of communists .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
However , in order to bring about a rapid economic growth of the national economy , the developing countries have generally selected the developed areas to implement a special opening up policy to promote further economic development of the developed areas by means of preferential policies and have regarded these areas as growth centers for promoting the overall development of the national economy .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
The $ 60-billion limited " Star War " missile defense , in US official language , is to counter the threat from so-called " rogue states " ( recently the United States has changed their names to " concerned countries " ) because those countries possess or are developing guided missile system and are threatening or will threaten the security of the United States and its allies within five years .  
The complexity of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that we are improving and developing the self-reform of the socialist system and the world is undergoing a profound change .  Against this background , people 's thinking has become lively ;  
Li Ruihuan said that China and Russia are facing huge domestic tasks in developing their economy and improving living standards , and they hold identical or similar views on many major international issues ; their two economies are strongly complementary , and there are broad prospects for developing bilateral friendly cooperation .  
In general , economic issues have been relatively outstanding subjects discussed at G-7 and G-8 summits .  Examples are macroeconomic management , international trade , and relations with developing countries .  Meanwhile , however , the summits have preserved a very clear political and ideological tradition .  
Since large enterprises are not required to exercise the function of bearing the financial burden in supporting social undertakings , the surplus personnel they released have to be digested by small and medium-sized enterprises .  Many new service sectors , such as service units in cities and towns as well as community services , have also relied on the support of small and medium-sized enterprises .  As a developing and rising group , small and medium-sized enterprises have started to show their vitality .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
These principles have now become universal standards for country-to-country relations , playing a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the friendship and cooperation among developing countries in general , and they are and will continue to have an important impact on the promotion of the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .  
The countries of Asia should seize the opportunity , aggressively adjusting their development strategies and accelerating the industrialization , modernization , and market-orientation process .  In particular , they should increase their investments in education and science and technology , vigorously developing and training talented individuals , emphasizing the development of new and advanced technology industries , accelerating industrial upgrades , promoting the sustained and rapid development of the Asian economy in the new century and gradually enabling the people everywhere to affluent lives .  
After the beginning of reform and opening-up , our country 's gross economic quantity continued to expand .  GDP increased from 362.4-billion yuan to over 8,000-billion yuan , ranking seventh place in the world and ranking first among all developing countries .  The output of major farm produce and industrial products also ranks in an advanced position in the world .  
All levels should regard improving leadership styles and doing well the positive three Stresses education as the concrete embodiment of carrying out the requirements of the " Three Representations " , as a real action of focusing on grassroots units and laying solid foundations , and as an important indicator of reinforcing and developing the achievements of the " Three Stresses " education held for Party committees at levels higher than the regiment .  
It will have a powerful theoretical weapon for developing advanced ideologies and eradicating backward ones , and it will have an ideological basis that is fundamental to the whole Party and people of the whole country in reinforcing unity and in consistently marching forward in the correct direction .  
Under modern conditions , especially under the conditions of high technologies , fighting with firepower has been vigorously developing to an unprecedented high level .  Firepower has become more extensive , more powerful , and more omnipresent .  It can even be said that the progress and ending of a battle with firepower will decide the progress and ending of a war .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
Among all sorts of comments , however , there is an overwhelming keynote : A crucial standard for judging the success or failure of the G-8 summit is what it has done for the developing regions , especially the poorest regions .  As the gap between poor and rich countries is widening and deepening , the G-8 is facing a grim challenge of the " digital gap " .  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
At the Central Committee Ideological and Political Work Conference , Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized that , in the face of the new circumstances and new situation , ideological and political work must make efforts to carry out innovation and improvement on a foundation of carrying on and developing superior traditions and in such areas as content , form , method , means , and mechanisms .  In particular , he stressed , efforts must be made to heighten the sense of the times and strengthen direction , effectiveness , and initiative .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
By saying that we should dare to say something new not mentioned by the old ancestors , he meant that as the times are moving ahead and practice is developing , new conditions and new issues will emerge in an endless stream , and it is impossible to find ready-made answers and solutions for our current issues from the works of the old ancestors .  We must work out solutions by ourselves by integrating the universal principles of Marxism with our current conditions and practice through studying new conditions , answering new questions , and blazing new trails .  
It was disclosed that the entire system is likely to cost as much as $ 60-billion upon completion .  However , no one is yet sure if the system will serve as " a seamless heavenly robe " free of problems upon completion .  Moreover , as modern science and technology are still developing at lightning speed , it is difficult to tell if the NMD system will end up as a heap of waste material in future .  
Second , major contradictions that can disrupt international security tend to become more strained .  For example , the contradiction between uni-polarization and multi-polarization , the contradiction between advanced countries and developing countries , and the contradictions between different nationalities and religions have all aggravated to different extents under the negative influence of economic globalization and as a result of the new interventionism practiced by the United States .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
Seeing the situation clearly , mastering the overall situation , correctly distinguishing between the essentials and the nonessentials , and safeguarding and developing the excellent situation in the ideological and political realm is an important guarantee for continuously pushing forward the reform and opening up and the socialist modernization drive as well as a fundamental requirement for shaping and nurturing a national spirit in the new century .  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
Meanwhile , the current international situation remains relatively complicated .  While peace and development are the main themes at present , hegemonism and power politics still exist .  The unfair and unreasonable international economic order is still playing its role , and the wealth gap between developing and developed countries keeps widening .  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
We revamped our concepts and emancipated our minds , guiding all areas to actively and boldly develop civil air defense reform practice .  We broke with the closed state , throwing open the doors , and sharply developing and utilizing early-stage projects , with projects integrating peacetime with wartime , such as underground markets , parking garages , production shops , and cultural entertainment places , springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
From the start , JBIV has been rather attentive to drawing other news media 's development experience and paid attention to developing an internet medium by making use of its own traditional superiority under the conditions of insufficient personnel and funds and relatively weak technical support .  
Since the implementation of the " Ninth Five-Year " Plan , we have scored glorious achievements in promoting spiritual civilization , while attaining tremendous successes in developing material civilization .  All this has provided a gigantic spiritual motive force and a strong ideological guarantee for the development of the reform and opening-up program and the socialist modernization drive .  
In diplomatic work , Comrade Geng Biao was firm on matters of principle and flexible on matters of tactics .  He put forward his unique viewpoints and creative ideas in light of the developing and changing situation .  He displayed very strong grasp of policy and strong mastery of the art of struggle .  
This afternoon , ministers from some 40 African countries in charge of diplomacy and economic and trade affairs gathered together with their Chinese counterparts in the Grand Banquet Hall of Beijing Hotel for the China-Africa Cooperation Forum - - Ministerial Conference 2000 .  They held a candid exchange of opinions and discussions on the two major themes of this conference : promoting the building of a new international political and economic order through China-Africa cooperation and further developing China-Africa economic and trade cooperation .  
This is not only an inevitable choice that developing countries must make in order to seek development in the new century , but also a driving force for building at an early date a new international political and economic order that is just and reasonable .  
This humorous remark elicited warm applause of all participants in the forum , which expressed the strong aspiration of developing countries toward building a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
They said that China had for a long time provided unconditional economic assistance to the African continent , and even though China is not Africa 's major creditor , this action taken by China as a developing country is indicative of its sincere hope to join Africa in realizing the common development aspiration within the framework of South-South cooperation .  Plus , this will help prompt Western countries to take real action toward the relief and reduction of Africa 's debts , they added .  
During the 10-year calamity , our country suffered from leftist disruptions and deviated from the fundamental task of " developing social productive forces " ; as a result , the national economy almost came to the brink of collapse and the Chinese nation lost a valuable development opportunity .  
It is necessary to adhere to the policy of having priorities , focusing on developing high-tech equipment that is truly effective on future battlefields , while continually improving the overall technology level of existing armaments and accelerating renovation and updating efforts , so as to prevent the emergence of a " generational gap " between our side and any enemy , a gap that is difficult to remedy .  
Li Zibin answered : The party Central Committee and the State Council have received a positive response from the people in the western region since they proposed implementing the strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  The vast masses of cadres and people in the western region are determined to seize this opportunity to bring about a leap in economic and social development .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
It is notable that while continuing to deepen bilateral military alliances with Japan , Australia , and the ROK , the United States is restoring and developing military ties with countries such as Thailand , the Philippines , Vietnam , and Singapore through a variety of military cooperation forms , such as gaining the right to use military facilities , agreements on military unit visits , joint military exercises , and so on , thereby markedly expanding its military presence in non-alliance countries and further increasing its military capability for intervening in Asia-Pacific affairs .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
Having witnessed improved economic life , people have started recognizing or supporting the SAR Government 's measures aimed at developing the economy , including measures for severely cracking down on illegal economic activities , for protecting intellectual property rights , for rectifying the market order , for building a much better international image for Macao , for raising the government work efficiency , for improving an internal investment environment , for inviting more outside investment or capital , and so on .  
It consisted of more than 5,000 people , making it the largest such delegation ever .  President Jiang Zemin met with the delegation and delivered a major speech on consolidating and developing Sino-Japanese friendship , which elicited positive responses among the people of both countries .  In October Premier Zhu Rongji paid an official visit to Japan and , in the spirit of enhancing trust , clearing suspicion , and expanding cooperation , engaged in wide contact with the Japanese government and all sectors of society .  
He discussed China 's principled stand on creating a new international political and economic order .  Like water pouring down a steep roof , his words powerfully reflected the heartfelt wishes of the peoples of all nations , particularly the numerous developing nations , for peace and development and were widely praised by the delegations .  
The draft has dedicated an entire chapter to the issue of national defense education for society , and formed stipulations respectively on the formats and demands for developing national defense education by state organs , enterprise units , social groups , committees for city residents , and committees for residents in rural areas ; and the formats and demands of conducting national defense education on militia and people on reserve duty by relevant military organs .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents " pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party must become a true representative of the needs of developing China 's advanced social production forces , of the course of progressing China 's advanced culture , and of the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .  
After acceding to the WTO , China will engage in international economic and trade cooperation under the multilateral , stable , and unconditional most favored nation treatment provided by all WTO member countries .  It will enjoy the benefits of market access in other countries and regions , and international discriminatory trade restrictions will be eliminated in a step-by-step fashion .  This will create a beneficial international economic environment for developing China 's domestic economy and foreign economic relations and trade .  
The rules of world economics and trade by which globalization is to be achieved are based on the old international economic and political order , formulated mainly with the interests of the developed countries in mind .  For the developing countries , the " rules of the game " are unfair .  
Second , it is positively implementing strategic adjustment of the economic structure , and it is doing all we can to achieve comprehensive advancement of tertiary industries in the direction of speeding up the development of modern service industries , powerfully developing high-tech industries , and positively moving modernization of agriculture forward .  
According to reports , Russia , in addition to taking active and passive defensive measures in developing its satellite systems , is also developing its antisatellite weapons on the basis of the operational antisatellite satellites , which the former Soviet Union developed , and on the basis of testing the land-based antisatellite laser weapons .  
During his visit Chairman Li Peng specially arranged to see the relatives of Dr . Kotnis , who sacrificed his precious life for the cause of the Chinese people 's liberation , and held extensive contacts and chats with responsible persons of Indian friendship bodies and figures in business , science and technology , and cultural circles , in which he conveyed to the Indian people the friendly feelings of the Chinese people and their sincere aspirations for developing bilateral ties .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
However , the developed countries in the West tried hard to dominate and control the globalization process and attempted to establish an international economic order more favorable to themselves .  On the other hand , the vast number of developing countries are facing various risks and stern challenges to their economic security and economic sovereignty .  Interference and anti-interference , Control and anti-control has become a prominent characteristic of the current international political contradictions and struggle .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
However , some local criminal and vicious groups are rapidly developing and their activities are becoming more and more vicious in recent years .  They have been using extremely cruel measures , which seriously undermine public security in society .  They have gradually become destructive and harmful criminal groups of Mafia nature .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
Vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is very important for us to live through the rigid test of reform , opening up and developing the socialist market economy and continuously advancing the current great project .  
The " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " was extended for an indefinite period with the support of many developing countries in 1995 , and the " Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty " was adopted by the United Nations in 1996 .  This is because the international community confirmed that the world would ultimately move toward a " nuclear-free " prospect and believed that the major nuclear arms powers would , in the end , gradually achieve balanced arms disarmament on the basis of cooperation among major powers .  
It has thoroughly given up the practice of either leaning toward the West or confronting the West , but has adopted an omnidirectional foreign strategy of conducting dialogue , laying equal stress on relations with the East and the West , developing relations with big powers , and strengthening bilateral or multilateral relations with other countries , aimed at protecting its national interests , particularly economic interests .  
Moreover , because its previous East European allies are now leaning toward the West , the pro-Western and separatist elements in the Commonwealth of Independent States are increasing , and Russia 's national strength is weakening , it can not afford much fund to help developing countries ; therefore its role in international affairs will be restricted .  
Not only has it been innovative in adopting new ideological concepts and modes of thinking in carrying out its domestic construction , it has also changed the isolationism of its past foreign policy , enthusiastically taking the initiative in developing relations with various countries .  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
These leaders should pay attention to study characteristics of these units , meticulously review positive experiences drawn from practice , and enthusiastically explore new issues and new problems that arise in the condition of reforming , opening up and developing a socialist market economy .  These leaders should closely associate the essence of the five-sentence general requirement and the " Program " with the reality of these " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units , work in a creative manner and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of our work .  
In Chinese society today when we are carrying out socialist modernization , the greatest benevolence is whatever is beneficial for developing the social productive forces , increasing all-round national strength , and improving living standards ; otherwise , a thing is non-benevolent or is evil .  
Persisting in focusing on economic construction and greatly liberating and developing the social productive forces are the largest political missions for China at the present time and reflect the basic interests of the people across the country , including the vast majority of members of the united front .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in the meeting of the national united front work that , only by persisting in developing the most extensive patriotic united front led by our Party and uniting the entire Chinese people to make joint striving to materialize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people , can we be certain of success .  
In recent years , as China has developed into a stronger China with continually enhanced international status , which the United States does not like to see , while strategically maintaining ties and economically occupying the China market , the United States has stubbornly played the human rights card , sowed discord between the masses and the government , and frequently caused trouble , interfering in , blocking , and sabotaging the cause of the Chinese people in following the road they have chosen and continually developing and growing stronger .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
To always represent the way forward for advanced culture is to persist in developing what is useful and discarding what is not , correctly handle the relationship between inheriting the national traditional culture and blazing new trails , and strengthen cultural exchanges between fraternal nationalities so as to absorb all fruits of civilization of the human society .  
Internationally , the trend toward economic globalization is intensifying , the scientific and technological revolution is developing by leaps and bounds , the pace of the readjustment of the industrial structure is quickening , and China 's neighboring countries are developing at an accelerated pace .  
As a developing country with a huge population , China is short on per capita resources and has practiced extensive development for years .  Despite its low income level , therefore , China is forced to deal with those problems that other countries did not have to tackle until their incomes reached a high level .  China 's resource and ecological situation is very grim .  
As China is a developing country as well as a major country which brooks no neglect in the political and economic life in the world .  Because China conducts a lot of international trade , when the trade talks involve concrete conflicting interests among the parties , everybody wants to hold the negotiations in a more explicit and detailed manner .  
Since its establishment , the foundation has given full play to its own characteristics and advantages , and has , with the assistance of friendly organizations and enthusiastic people at home and abroad , dedicated itself to developing the cultural , educational , science , technology and welfare undertakings for children and promoting the healthy mental and physical development of children ;  
Jiang Zemin also extended congratulations to the newly formed Thai Government and expressed his appreciation of the Thai Government 's active attitude toward developing friendly relations with China . He said : China supports Thailand 's stand to promote friendly cooperation with its neighbors and to facilitate regional dialogue and cooperation .  Jiang Zemin said he believes that Thailand will play a positive role for regional peace , stability and development .  
Yang Jiechi , Chinese ambassador to the United States , chaired this evening 's function .  In his address , he said : Vice premier Qian 's visit to the United States has fulfilled the objectives of strengthening contact , improving understanding , expanding common consent , and developing cooperation .  It has given a powerful impetus to the development of Sino-US relations toward a sound and stable course .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
They briefed each other on their respective domestic situations and had an extensive exchange of views on further developing the relations of friendly cooperation between the two parties and the two countries of China and DPRK , on regional and international relations , and on other issues of common concern .  
However , due to the irrational international economic order formed long time ago , various countries do not have an equal share of the benefits of globalization , developing countries are in a relatively unfavorable position in the process of globalization , and the wealth gap between the North and the South has been widened further .  
In order to provide market access opportunities for the undertaking of developing institutional investors on an usual scale and on the basis of strict self-discipline , the China Securities Regulatory Commission will adopt a series of measures including introduction of open-end fund , making preparations for and give approval to establishment of new fund companies , paying attention to relevant preparation work in terms of establishment of fund management companies of Chinese-foreign joint ventures , and conducting studies on proposals of innovation of various funding products which have been transformed from closed-end to open-end .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
( 3 ) Proceeding from the realities in the country and in the armed forces ; drawing upon beneficial experiences from foreign forces ; emancipating the mind ; seeking truth from facts ; boldly furthering explorations ; bravely blazing new trails ; comprehensively adopting modern scientific methods or means ; and developing a military theory with Chinese characteristics .  
The mass troop trainings in science and technology are developing in breadth and depth , the research of key subjects like combined operation , electronic warfare , airstrike countermeasure , new " three hittings and three defenses , and so on have made new breakthroughs , the study of high-tech knowledge , cultivation of talented people , training in new equipment , and so on , have all acquired remarkable effects , thus the fighting capacity of troops being further improved .  
It is necessary to act according to the requirements of the " three represents " to earnestly study and resolve the new situations and new issues encountered in the building of party organizations under the new historical condition of reform and opening up and developing the socialist market economy and conduct education for maintaining the advanced nature of the party with targets in mind , so as to let party branches at grass-roots level possess very strong capability in directing the overall building of companies and resolving their own problems and party member truly display an exemplary role .  
Wang Shijie stressed : In the new century , various countries should promote democratization of international relations and establish a new international political and economic order that is fair and just .  They should ensure that the broad masses of developing countries have the right to equally participate in the decisions on global economic affairs .  
However , owing to the irrational international economic order that has been formed for a long time , the benefits received by various countries in globalization are very unbalanced , the developing countries are in a relatively disadvantageous position in the process of globalization , and the gap between the poor and the rich and between the South and the North has been further widened .  
He said that under the current international situation of multipolarization and economic globalization , the developing countries should intensify unity and coordination , cope with all problems in a positive attitude , and make concerted efforts to establish a fair , reasonable new international political and economic order .  
Tang Jiaxuan said : Countries in East Asia and Latin American are mostly developing countries .  They have common interests and tasks .  They are all exploring a path of development commensurate with their own national conditions and seeking a regional cooperation model in conformity with their own actual conditions , and striving to usher in a more stable , equal , and fair world .  We have a common wish to use each other 's experience as reference , learn from each other , and cooperate with each other .  
Professor Yu frankly admitted that as a developing country with a population of 1.2-billion , China 's per capita natural resources are comparatively scant , its current economic and cultural development is imbalanced , its legal system is not complete , and , in the process of law enforcement , some laws are not strictly abided by and some laws are not strictly enforced - - all these contribute to the non-perfect human rights situation in China .  
Brazilian Ambassador Affonso Celso de Ouro-Preto said that Brazil and China are two important developing countries , adding that the two countries have had good ties of political cooperation and take an identical or similar stand on major international affairs .  He said that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits between the two countries would further cement bilateral relations and deepen mutual understanding and consensus between the two peoples .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
Chi Haotian said : Both China and Gabon are developing countries .  The two countries ' cooperation in the political , economic , military , and cultural areas has been remarkable ; and the two countries share common views on a wide range of important international issues .  
Personalities here believe that the benign interaction of the Chinese and Australian senior military officers will be beneficial to developing a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries and armies and to maintaining regional security as well .  
Developed countries , and even some developing countries , have invariably realized that a trial of strength in a future hi-tech war will first and foremost be a trial of strength over science and technology , and a comprehensive trial of strength over science and technology is , in the final analysis , competition over qualified personnel .  In a certain sense , it could be said that the outcome of today 's competition over qualified personnel will decide the outcome of tomorrow 's fighting on a battlefield .  
In his speech , Jiang Zhenghua said : The current international situation is generally moving toward alleviation , the trend of political multipolarity and economic globalization is developing rapidly , and modern science and technology centering on information technology and life science has advanced by leaps and bounds .  
The economic and trade commissions at all levels must fullyunderstand the important significance of rectifying and standardizing marketeconomic order from the high plane of intensifying the work of public order , solidifying and developing the good momentum of national economic development , heightening the overall quality and competitiveness of the national economy , further opening wider to the outside world , and establishing and perfecting thesocialist market economic structure .  They should further enhance their senseof responsibility and sense of mission , and ceaselessly strengthen theirinitiative and consciousness in work .  
Jiang Zemin said : " China and Chile are separated by vast oceans .  However , the common goal of safeguarding world peace , protecting sovereign rights , developing the national economy , and improving the people 's life has tightlyunited us . "  
He said , through thejoint efforts of the international community , effective international rulesshould be drawn up on the basis of full participation and democraticconsultation by all countries , to ensure that globalization can help to narrowthe disparities between north and south and between rich and poor , help topromote common development , help the developing countries to benefit fromglobalization , and help to promote balanced , steady , and sustainable worldeconomic development .  
- - All developing countries strengthen unity , make joint efforts toestablish a fair and reasonable international political and economic new order.Strive to advance democratization in international relations ;  
Everybody who has little , elementary knowledge of the international law knows that the exclusive economic zone is the major outcome of the long-term struggle waged by numerous developing countries for their legal rights and interests after World War II .  
Although a number of developing countries or countries making an economic switch are practicing a market economy legal system , the market is unable to operate efficiently because the law and rule of law is not on a sound basis ; on the one hand lack of clarity in individual and enterprise property rights means that economic efficiency falls , contracts can not be effectively enforced , and disputes can not be settled in fair fashion ;  
To keep alive its advanced nature , our party should concentrate on developing the social productive forces , closely follow the major trend of development in the world in terms of science and technology and economy , take economic construction as the center , combine the advanced trends in the knowledge economy , science and technology progress , and social development in an organic way , and strive to serve well as the representative of the development demand of China 's advanced social productive forces .  
Being the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres , China and Brazil have the duties to play a positive role in propelling the healthy development of the world political and economic situations .  
Intensifying coordination and cooperation and deepening the strategic partnership between China and Brazil is of vital significance to augmenting the strength of the developing countries as a whole and giving impetus to the establishment of a fair , rational new political and economic order in the world .  
Jiang Zemin expressed his firm belief that constant strengthening of Sino-Brazil relations not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and their people , but also conforms to the common interests of the large numbers of developing countries , and definitely will make positive contributions to lasting regional and world peace and prosperity .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
Li Baodong pointed out : According to this strategy , the Chinese Government will appropriate huge amounts of funds for developing infrastructure facilities and basic industries in these areas , thus keeping the economic growth rate in these areas higher than the national average .  Last year , the economic growth rate in the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups reached 8.5 percent .  
At the ceremony marking the publication of the first report from the forum " China and Her Neighbors , " a joint effort of the Wilton Park Conference , an independent British academic organization , and the Hong Kong Superior Resources Group , Wang Zhile pointed out that , faced with economic globalization , the developed nations and the developing nations alike should readjust the angles and ways in which they view the issue .  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .  
Contents in the preface of the revised law include the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping Theory and call for adhering to reform , opening up , taking the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , developing a socialist market economy and strengthening the building of socialist democracy and legal system .  The revised law has clearly defined the system of regional national autonomy as a basic political system of our country .  
China attaches great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Yugoslavia in the political , economic , cultural and educational areas .  China maintains that healthy development of Sino-Yugoslav relations is in the fundamental interests of the two countries .  
If the target firing tests of the unmanned Stealth fighter are successful , and the program for development of the new type of nuclear weapons is approved , this will mean that the Bush Administration will pour more and more funds into developing futuristic military technology in the hope of maintaining the US hegemonist status in the world through pursuing absolute superiority in military technology ; and still more , it will mean that the United States will make the world still less peaceful and secure , and this is bound to trigger a large-scale arms race worldwide .  
Besides , it is also right and proper for " those who owe more to repay more ; " moreover , under the Kyoto Protocol , developing countries also accept the responsibility for curbing climatic change according to the principle of " collective but differentiated responsibility . "  The United States must not stare fixedly at the chimneys in other countries while turning a blind eye to the smoke surging from the far more numerous chimneys at home .  
Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .

Together they must work out a set of rules that are in the interests of all nations and will promote joint economic development and establish a new international economic order that is fair and equitable so that all countries will benefit tangibly from economic globalization and the push for an information economy .  
The Vietnamese party , government , and people attach great importance to the important consensus of opinion and the common guideline reached by the supreme leaders of the two parties for Vietnamese-Chinese relations in the 21st century , and are willing to make further effort to guarantee the more effective implementation of the documents and agreements signed by both sides , thus strengthening our bilateral friendly and cooperative relations in the fields of exchanging our experience in state administration , developing economic and trade relations , expanding international cooperation .  
It is necessary to unremittingly enhance rural grassroots cadres ' ability to lead the masses in readjusting the economic structure and developing the rural economy , try hard to improve their understanding of policy , enhance their legal sense , and try hard to raise their level and ability in correctly understanding and handling the people 's internal contradictions in the new period .

Proceeding from their hegemonist aims , they desperately cling to their cold war mentality , always wanting to set up some " enemy " or " opponent , " and proceed to regard socialist China as " the main threat " ; they continually use the Taiwan , Tibet , and human rights issues as pretexts for interfering in China 's internal affairs , persist in developing Theater Missile Defense , which jeopardizes China 's security , plot to step up arms sales to Taiwan , and regard China as the assumed enemy in military exercises .  
The state has decided to make infrastructure construction the base , strengthening the protection and construction of the ecological environment the main content , grasping the readjustment of the industrial structure the key , developing scientific and technological education the basic condition , and thorough reform and expanded open up the strong driving force of development .

He pointed out : Every time the anti-China motion is raised , the United States makes the same argument that the human rights situation in China has been deteriorating , and such an argument is in total disregard of China 's great achievements in developing its economy and promoting social progress and the fact that the Chinese people are enjoying civil and political rights to an unprecedented degree in terms of both scope and depth in these years .  
The Pakistani people are so full of wisdom .  His humorous words laid bare the fact that the United States keeps using its " 301 Article " against developing countries and tries to link the human rights issue to China 's permanent normal trade position .  Even the US representative could not help but force a wry and embarrassed smile .  
On 29 April , Li Ruogu , assistant president of the People 's Bank of China and deputy Chinese director of the IMF , called on developed countries to make greater effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , maintain the stability of exchange rates between major currencies , and thus create a better external environment for economic growth in developing countries .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
To find a way out of the difficult position , create a peaceful and stable external environment , reinvigorate the economy , and make the country prosperous and powerful , the DPRK is endeavoring to implement an omnidirectional foreign policy , with the stress on developing the relations with EU member states and has sent delegations one after another to EU member states , and thus laid a foundation for improvement of bilateral political and economic relations .

Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
Huang Ju pointed out the respective advantages enjoyed by Shanghai and Taiwan in developing the economy , saying that the two economies are greatly complementary , and that further stepping up economic exchanges and cooperation between Shanghai and Taiwan is not only in accord with the objective requirements for the two regions ' development but also in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that China and Syria are both developing countries ; the Chinese Government values its traditional friendship with Syria and appreciates and thanks the Syrian Government for its enduring valuable support for China on the Taiwan and human rights issues ; it is ready to continue to maintain and strengthen coordination and cooperation with Syria in all fields in the new century , and raise to a new level the enduringly stable bilateral relationship of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation .  
The " strike-hard " struggle is developing in intensity in all localities , public security organs at all levels are effectively cracking down on crimes , and initial results have been obtained in the special action to " prevent explosions and seize guns " and in other special actions .  A large quantity of illegally possessed firearms and ammunition were seized and destroyed , thus eliminating a hidden danger to public order , and a number of criminal gangs have been ferreted out .  
Wang Zhongyu said : In the work of training and attracting talented , skilled , and qualified people , efforts should be focused on meeting the urgent human resources needs at the higher levels , thus enhancing the overall level of human resources in our country , enhancing our international competition power , and providing human resources guarantee for developing science , technology , and productivity by leaps and bounds .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
bilateral cooperation between the two sides in various fields be strengthened ; their consulting role in the union of parliaments be brought into better play so that both sides can better safeguard the rights and interests of the developing countries , jointly hold high the banner of peace , development , and cooperation , and make positive contributions to the establishment of a fair and reasonable international new order .  
Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .  However , they spontaneously stressed the crucial role of developing cross-strait relations .  Some scholars pointed out that the authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has led people to lose hope .  
Meanwhile , upholding the principle of developing weapons and equipment in a coordinated and comprehensive manner , the Russian armed forces are developing currently relatively backward weapon and equipment programs , such as communication systems for field operations , automatic systems , and reconnaissance systems in order to enable the general level of weapons and equipment always maintain its leading position in the world .  
we must adhere to the guiding principle of " one central task , two important jobs , and three assurances , " i.e . , we should regard economic construction as the central task , closely attend to maintaining stability and developing the economy , and ensure long-term social peace and stability in Tibet , ensure the rapid development of Tibet 's economy , and ensure notable improvement of the living standard of the people of Tibet ;  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .  He hoped that Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles would play a greater role in developing the motherland 's western region and in promoting the common development of Hong Kong and the interior .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
In accordance with the UN charter and the acknowledged basic norms of international law , they should step up consultation , coordination , and cooperation , correctly handle the major political , security , and economic problems facing the international community , show proper concern for the interests and demands of the developing countries , and turn the AMEM into a major force in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order .  
Asia is the world 's most populous region where most developing countries are situated , which have numerous newly rising markets , various natural resources , and investment effect with unlimited potential .  
Third , as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and the biggest developing country in the world , China has persistently pursued an independent and good-neighborly foreign policy , advocated engaging all-directional dialogues with all regions of the world , including Europe , and promoted the establishment of a fairer and more rational international political and economic new order .  
Here I would like to make a special explanation of one thing , that is , the " multipolarization , " which the Chinese people have often referred to , is based on a new understanding of the international relations in the new period or based on the philosophic and cultural theory that " the world is pluralistic and diversified in nature " rather than developing confrontation against a certain superpower or letting just a few big powers decide world affairs .  
At this critical moment for carrying forward the cause and forging ahead into the future , the party Central Committee and the State Council are holding a relevant meeting to summarize past experience and arrange the work for the next 10 years .  The current meeting will certainly have a profound impact on the work of aiding and developing poor areas for the new period .  
The great achievements made by China in supporting and developing poor areas have made important contributions to promoting economic growth , national unity , frontier security , and social stability , and to helping people to live a comfortable life on the whole . 
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
We must always uphold the guidelines for work in Tibet during the new period formulated at the Third Central Forum on Work in Tibet , which call for " taking economic construction as the central task ; firmly focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation ; and ensuring Tibet 's accelerated economic development , all-round social progress , lasting peace and stability , and continuous improvement of the people 's living standards . "  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
We must never be unworthy of the concern and expectation of the central authorities and the whole nation .  We must overcome all difficulties , work vigorously to make the region prosperous , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , and produce brilliant results once more in the course of developing Tibet by leaps and bounds and ensuring lasting peace and stability .  
This partnership is aimed at pursuing common development through increased bilateral cooperation , proceeding from the reality that both China and Venezuela are developing nations faced with the task of expediting economic development to raise the living standards of the people .  
A : China-Venezuela relations have been developing well in recent years .  The two sides have maintained high-level exchanges , made notable achievements in economic and trade cooperation , and gradually extended their cooperation in cultural , educational , scientific and technological fields .  
The " Russian Weapons and Equipment Development Plan for 2010 " , approved by President Putin early this year , has specifically defined the direction of priority development of weapons and equipment for the Russian military .  The Russian military will adhere to the general principle of " reducing quantity and increasing quality " in the development of weapons .  It will give priority to developing integrated weapon systems with higher capabilities and greater precision that combine reconnaissance , forewarning , command , positioning , attack , and communications .  
At a regular press conference held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today , Zhu Bangzao , spokesman of the ministry , said while asserting the necessity of paying attention to international coordination and developing friendly relations with all countries in Asia , Japan 's leader has insisted on visiting the Yasukuni Shrine , which houses memorial tablets of Japanese Class-A war criminals .  We find it difficult to understand this .  
Senior officials exchanged views on the possible elements that may be included in the new round of WTO talks and some specific initiatives raised by member economies , pointing out that a balanced agenda should be facilitated for the multilateral trade talks in order to benefit all member economies , especially the developing economies , through a multilateral trading system .  
For example , they were related to such issues as reforming the housing system , reforming tertiary education , developing cultural industry , rebuilding old and dilapidated houses and buildings , and protecting historical cultural relics and legacies .  At the same time , the municipal party committee and government also set up a briefing system and arrange high-level and small-scope heart-to-heart talks .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
In a meeting today with Rupert C . Montanaro , commander of the armed forces of Malta , Chi Haotian , vice chairman of the Central Military Commission , state councilor , and national defense minister , said that developing healthy and lasting military ties between the two countries under the new historic conditions is the common wish of the Chinese and Maltese people .  He was convinced that Sino-Maltese military relations would enter a new stage of development following the commander 's ongoing visit .  
China is willing to improve its communication and coordination with all nations , especially the vast number of developing countries , so as to push forward the development of world multipolarization and eliminate the imbalance and injustice brought by economic globalization , and to make unremitting efforts for building a fair , rational , and new international political and economic order as well as peace and progress that the people of all nations can enjoy .  
To solve the problem of " insufficient services " from the government in the course of structural adjustment , the party committee and government of Linyi County have intensified market forecast and perspective study , put forward the objectives of building Linyi into a " large agricultural county free of environmental pollution " , and led the peasants in developing ecological agriculture , unique agriculture , sophisticated agriculture , and agriculture in which production is carried out on orders .  
In addition , some stress cooperation among the cities in the course of economic globalization in an attempt to " get rid of constraints imposed by states " .  Such a view is as a matter of fact an attempt to break down the existing legal system in various countries , which runs counter to the interests of developing countries and is not conducive to improving habitat conditions in those countries .  
Over the past century and half , it has kept advancing continually in practice , developing continually in practice , studying new situations , answering new questions , and continually incorporating , borrowing , and integrating various outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , thereby enabling Marxism to always maintain its vitality and to continually open new realms .  
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , a qualified leading cadre must not only have a relatively high political quality and a relatively strong professional ability but must also have relatively high legal quality .  
Li Lanqing fully affirmed the excellent achievements of Shanghai in economic and social development .  He greatly praised Shanghai for its efforts in vigorously rectifying and regulating the market economic order , developing chain operations for materials circulation , and strictly controlling the cultural market , in addition to accelerating the socialization of logistics work for institutes of higher learning and building the " university city " and quality education bases for youth in the course of educational reform .  
As Chinese trade minister Shi Guangsheng , chairman of the latest APEC ministerial meeting , pointed out , if a new round of multilateral trade negotiations is not launched in a timely manner , regional trade organizations will gain further ground , to the detriment o global trade , which is not good for either developing or developed countries .  
The meeting was of the view that the WTO ministerial meeting to be held in November in Doha , Qatar , will be an important opportunity to start a new round of trade talks ; and that it is necessary to speed up WTO work , decide as quickly as possible on an agenda of talks that is balanced , maneuverable , and broadly based , and to show special concern for the interests of developing members .  
The ministers firmly committed themselves to pursue open regionalism , reaffirming APEC 's strong support for an open , equitable , sound , and rule-based multilateral trading system , from which all economies , developed and developing ones alike , stand to benefit .  
The ministers reaffirmed the statement of the Brunei Ministerial Conference and Informal Leadership Meeting on launching a new round of multilateral trade talks in 2001 , held that the WTO Ministerial Conference to be held in November in Qatar represents a critical opportunity for the launch of a new round of WTO talks and that it is necessary to accelerate WTO work , speedily formulate a balanced , operational , broad-based agenda for the talks , and expressed particular concern for the interests of developing members .  
Berger was Clinton 's military advisor on foreign affairs and security questions , and was a motivating force for the United States and China developing " relations of strategic partners " .  At present , he still insists that " based on the United States ' principles of democracy and national security , the government is obligated to continue to carry out policies to maintain contact with China in principle " .  
Whether to let more countries , including developing nations , share the opportunities and benefits brought on by economic globalization , or to continue to widen the gap between rich and poor countries is a choice that must be made in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations held by the WTO .  
Based on this concept , McNamara 's ideal post-Cold War world is one in which all countries pledge not to change national boundaries by force , ethnic minorities in all countries enjoy legally protected rights , an international organization is formed to solve regional conflicts , developing countries are given help to step up economic reform and promote social progress , and global environment is protected .  
For this purpose , President Jiang put forward four proposals , namely , " replenishing and developing the ' Shanghai Five ' mechanism " , " deepening cooperation in the security field , " " advancing bilateral and multilateral economic and trade cooperation " , and " strengthening cooperation on the international stage " .  
The military region party committee , maintaining that these personnel should contribute their talents and services to developing ways and means for winning future warfare , decided to turn them into highly proficient military personnel during the course when the armed forces were engaged in science and technology training .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
In its annual report released on 31 May the Defense Ministry of India once again spread the sheer fallacy of the so-called " theory of China threat " , alleging that there is an exceptionally great imbalance in nuclear power between China and India with China enjoying a huge superiority , that " all major cities in India are within the range of China 's guided missiles " and , fabricating rumors out of thin air , that China is assisting Pakistan in developing the latter 's missile and nuclear capability .  
Since the nuclear tests , India has stepped up the process to become nuclear armed in disregard of international community 's opposition .  Successively , it has established the " minimum nuclear deterrence " strategy , called for the establishment of a " three in one " nuclear strike system , frequently carried out various kinds of guided missile tests , and stepped up importing and developing advanced fighter planes .  
With the beginning of the new century , our country 's drive for socialist modernization has entered a new stage of development .  The world scientific and technological revolution is developing rapidly , the tendency toward economic globalization is getting stronger , the pace of industrial restructuring is quickening , and international competition is becoming increasingly keen ; all these pose new challenges to us .  
Therefore , in carrying out ideological and political education , the military should focus on characteristics and special features , in the process of developing or discarding ideas or ethical standards existing in society in a pluralistic context .  
On the sound basis of political mutual trust , China attaches importance to developing economic cooperation with neighboring countries and has actively uplifted economic cooperation to a higher level .  
It speaks for equal treatment , seeking common ground while reserving differences , instead of using force or threatening to use force , or seeking dominance or even acting like a bully .  It strives to achieve cooperative security by developing extensive exchanges and cooperation .  In this way , it will benefit peace and development of the world .  
After the Bush administration came to power , it treated Russia as " the number one potential opponent " of the United States . It showed an extreme distrust of the Putin government and expressed strong disapproval of Russia 's developing military cooperation with Iran in addition to restoring and strengthening its relationships with some former Soviet Union allies .  
It is learned that because of the wide gap in the ratio of investment in offensive and defensive weapons , the national army is actively developing " defensive deterrence weapons system , " including secret development of the medium-range ballistic missile with a firing range from 1,000 and 2,000 kilometers , code-named " Tiching . " The army has reported the whole program to President Chen Shui-bian , who has asked the military to develop it as a priority key project .  
Examining ourselves , after over 50 years of development , especially since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have the important ideological and political basis for basically realizing modernization , material and technical bases , as well as mass basis by the middle of this century , and the vigorous and rapidly developing socialist cause with Chinese characteristics .  
In discussing the bilateral military relationship , Chi Haotian said the Chinese armed forces are very positive regarding developing friendly relations with the British armed forces , with the frequent high-level exchanges of visits between the two countries ' armed forces in recent years , and constant progress in each area of cooperation and exchange .  
Use Marxist materialist conception of history to gradually weaken idealist theism , replace feudalism and superstition and ignorance and backwardness with modern knowledge in science and technology , divert the attention of religion believers toward developing the economy and improving living standard materially and culturally , and guide religion into categories compatible with the socialist society for the temples , monks and nuns to play a positive and useful role in social life .  
At the moment of commemorating the 80th anniversary of the party 's founding , we should seriously sum up the historical achievements of the united front and more profoundly understand its development regularity and historic mission .  This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
Over the 80 years , in the practice of consolidating and developing the united front , our party not only accumulated successful experience , but also learned profound lessons from the negative experience , thus understanding some basic facts as the regularity of the work in this field .  
Faced with the complex internal and external situation and the glorious mission that we shoulder , in order to meet the challenges on our way ahead , undergo the tests of various dangers and difficulties that may occur , and continually create a new situation in developing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , we must stand in the forefront of the era , continually step up and improve our own building , and make efforts to raise the ideological , organization , and work style building of the party to a new level .  
During those warring years , the reason for the strength of the party growing from small to big , the propositions of the party conforming with the popular feelings , and the armed forces of the party developing like a single spark starting a prairie fire was because the party regarded doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses in doing everything as its fundamental line .  As it could fulfill what it said and represented the fundamental interests of the people , it won the hearts of the people .  
The quality level in science has a great impact on the way people use knowledge to conduct scientific thinking and the way of improving science and technological innovation .  The level in science also greatly impacts developing productive forces and culture .  
I hope the masses of science and technology workers will stay on the cutting edge of the new era , closely integrating personal ambitions with the nation 's future and fate ; undertake the historical responsibility of promoting science and technology advancements and innovations ; and continuously contribute to developing China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized modern socialist country .  
Thus , we should be concentrated in developing productivity with the driving force of the new relations of production , and step up our socialist construction to make our country rich and powerful and enable our people to lead a better-off life .  This would be favorable to the development of the country and in keeping with the fundamental interests and ardent hopes of the general public .  
Especially since the beginning of the 1990 ' s , with the continuous progress of the domestic and international situation and the magnificent cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the central leadership collective of the party with Jiang Zemin as the core has adhered to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and made new explorations in practice and a new summarization in theory of many major economic , political , cultural , military , and diplomatic issues , thus enriching and developing Deng Xiaoping Theory .  
It also adopted the guiding principle and policy of " letting literature and art service socialism and the people " and " letting a-hundred flowers blossom and a-hundred schools of thought contend . "  Furthermore , it emphasized the necessity of developing a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics .  All this has shown that the CPC has always represented the progressive course of China 's advanced culture , and that it has been making unremitting efforts to bring about and develop our prosperous and outstanding national culture .  
The party has persisted in unfolding the main themes , advocating diversified development of our cultural undertakings , and vigorously developing our literature and art , press and publication , and radio and television undertakings to constantly satisfy our people 's increasing spiritual and cultural demands .  Cultural life of our urban and rural people is rich and colorful .  
China started the use of foreign capital from scratch and saw an ever-growing increase in this aspect .  As of the end of 2000 , our country approved establishing more than 364,000 foreign-funded enterprises , contracts involving US $ 676.7-billion were signed , and US $ 348.6-billion foreign capital was actually used .  China ranked first among developing countries for eight consecutive years in terms of assimilating foreign direct investment .  
The 14th Party Congress called for developing the socialist market economy .  The foreign trade system has been reformed in an in-depth manner according to the orientation set forth at the 14th Party Congress - - " unified policies , relaxed management , equal competition , self-responsibility for profits or losses , integration of industry with trade , and implementation of a commission-based system . "  
Therefore , our party is required to deeply understand and acutely grasp the requirement for developing China 's advanced productive forces , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the direction for the advancement of China 's advanced culture , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people in China , to treat the three as an integrated whole , and to genuinely , effectively , and systematically represent them through a set of correct of line , principles , and policies and effective forms .  
Heroic models and advanced typical examples are valuable wealth of our party and the country .  Their lofty thinking is playing an increasingly greater role to influence and lead the people .  Their actions are of great significance to fostering healthy tendencies in the society , developing the spirit of our times and promoting reform , opening up and the socialist modernization drive .  
third , persist in comprehensively carrying out the party 's national and religious policies , making constant efforts to consolidate and develop socialist national relations marked by equality , unity , and mutual aid among the masses of every nationality in Tibet , and persist in developing a strong and patriotic united front ;  
After the founding of the CPC , the Chinese nation underwent the great changes from a poor and backward nation to a prosperous and vigorously developing nation , from a disintegrated nation to a strong and unified nation , from a nation being bullied and humiliated by foreign powers to a nation being able to hold its head high and stand aloof among all nations in the world .  
We have actively advocated and safeguarded the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , and resolutely opposed hegemonism and power politics with the strong domineering over the weak .  We have upheld principle and justice , striving to let justice prevail and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the vast developing countries , and pushed the establishment of a just and reasonable new international political and economic order .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .  
Strengthening socialist ideological and ethical building constitutes the essential content of and a key link in developing China 's advanced culture .  
It was precisely because of this that Dr . Sun Yat-sen emphasized the importance of developing our own culture while speaking about nationalism despite controversial views and the strong atmosphere of opposing what was traditional in the academic circles .  
Third , Deng Xiaoping Theory adheres to the broad vision of Marxism in observing the world , and makes correct analysis and reaches new and scientific conclusions on the features of the current times and the overall international situation , on the successes and failures of other socialist countries in the world , on the gains and losses of other developing countries in seeking development , on the development postures and contradictions in developed countries , and on the profound impact of the scientific and technological progress on the economic and social life .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that China and India are two biggest developing countries of the world .  Both of them face the tasks of developing the economy and improving the people 's living standard and need a peaceful and stable surrounding environment .  
In meeting with delegates , CPC General Secretary and State Chairman Jiang Zemin stressed that adhering to carrying out the basic national policy of opening up to the outside , attracting more and better foreign capital and developing an open-style economy will be of major significance in furthering the continued rapid and healthy development of our national economy .  
In this speech , standing in the forefront of the times , setting his feet on new practice , and mastering the features of the times , Comrade Jiang Zemin applied the basic theory of Marxism to have studied and answered the important issues about the practice of building socialism , deepened the understanding about the laws governing communist parties holding power , governing the building of socialism , and governing the development of human society , thus making new contributions to enriching and developing Marxism .  
According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .  By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
Despite the fact that the current situation at home and abroad is favorable to us , we must soberly realize that China is developing its modernization program in a more complicated international environment .  Right now , the world is undergoing profound changes .  It is becoming more and more multi-polarized , and continuously marching toward economic globalization .  
Our workers in the field of philosophy and social science should follow Secretary Jiang 's demands and " take our direction from Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , planting our feet on the real achievements of constructing a Chinese-style socialism , setting our eyes on the progress of development of world social science and culture , and constantly developing healthy , upward striving , rich and colorful socialism with Chinese style and special Chinese characteristics . "  
Just after the Bush Administration was inaugurated , it adopted a rightist and extremist policy toward China , which not only was not in line with the norms of international law , but also eroded US consortiums ' interests in developing economic relations with China and ran counter to US allies ' middle-course and moderate policies toward China . The Bush Administration 's reckless moves were questioned and contained by people in the United States as well as US allies .  
After the socialist transformation was complete , and the basic socialist system was established , the advanced nature of our Party was reflected in the endeavors of leading the people of all ethnic groups across the nation in vigorously developing the social productive forces and bringing to fruition national industrialization .  
This treaty will become a legal document guiding the development of bilateral relations in the new century , and it is bound to have a far-reaching positive impact on the two countries in developing enduring good neighborly , friendly , and mutual beneficial and cooperative relations .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
The foreign policy must serve the needs of domestic development : making the country strong and prosperous , developing the economy , and improving the living standard of the people .  
exemplarily carrying out the party 's ethnic and religious policies ; actively assisting local authorities in vigorously developing science and technological , educational , cultural , and health work ; serving as a vanguard , fighting on the forefront , heroically protecting the people 's lives and property in various missions to deal with emergencies and relieve disaster victims , writing heroic songs of victory one after another and fully demonstrating a good image of being a mighty and civilized army and an army of triumph .  
At present , both China and Russia are shouldering the heavy tasks of developing the domestic economy , maintaining national unity , defending independence and sovereignty , and safeguarding their respective proper positions and legitimate rights in the international community .  
Today 's Tibet is a picture of vigor and prosperity as the economy is developing , society is making progress , the various ethnic groups are united , the situation is stable , the border defense is solid and the people are leading a peaceful and contented life .  
Jiang Zemin said : China has always paid great attention to developing relations with Belarus and respected the choice Belarus made on its development approach and its internal and foreign policy .  China supports the efforts of Belarus to oppose any foreign interference and to safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity .  
The hosting of the Olympic Games and entry to the World Trade Organization are bound to redouble the strength of the Chinese economy , which is already developing in a sound and rapid manner .  China 's overall national strength and international status will certainly grow rapidly , thus laying a solid material foundation for the reunification of the motherland .  
Enhancing socialist ideological and ethics building is a major content of developing an advanced culture , and one of the important things is to do well in ideological and ethics building among leading cadres , particularly among senior level cadres .  
President Jiang Said : " In this visit to your honorable country , I want to increase my understanding of your honorable country ; to exchange deep ideas with president De Marko and other leaders of your honorable country concerning developing relations between our two countries , and international problems of mutual concern ; to have broad contact with people in various fields in your country - - doing all this to increase the friendship between the people 's of the two countries , and to propel the development of Sino-Maltese relations to a new standard . 
Despite Pronk 's proposal not being completely satisfactory , developing countries , keeping in mind the general interests of improving the international ecological environment , finally agreed to accept Pronk 's proposal in order to enable the " Kyoto Protocol " to go into force at an early date and to compel developed countries to take practical and effective measures to reduce greenhouse gases emissions .  
However , if Western developed countries continue to turn a blind eye to the global wide gap between the rich and the poor , large quantity of unemployment , and ecological damage , and if they continue to turn a deaf ear to the voice of developing countries and ordinary people , President Bush perhaps will see more miserable tragedies in greater numbers , and it will also be difficult for the United States not to get involved .  
Although it is extensively opposed by the international community , including US allies , development of the missile defense system is expected to require over $ 100-billion .  Despite the current unsolvable technical difficulty , the United States has hardened its determination to act its own way in developing and deploying the missile defense system .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
In order to further improve the global development environment , the developing and the developed countries should continue to promote reforms in the international financial setup , launch a new round of WTO trade negotiations , narrow the development gap between the developing and the developed countries , and work together to build a more fair and rational new international economic order .  
The second transformation has been to set out from the real situation with China 's transitional transformation of agricultural development , emphasizing adjustment of structure , optimizing product types , raising quality , and developing optimal highly productive and highly effective agriculture .  
When confirming development items , we must set out from the real situation in various localities , taking the market as our direction , paying attention to putting into play the comparative advantage of development zones , and focusing on developing leading agricultural products and pillar industries which possess regional uniqueness .  
We must adhere to taking irrigation as the focus of basic agricultural construction , continuing the reform of mid-level production fields , developing high yield , stable yield , water economizing , and highly effective agricultural fields , effectively consolidating , protecting , and raising the production capabilities of China 's basic agricultural fields . b ) .  
Taking the overall interests into consideration under such circumstances , the Netherlands and other EU nations brought forward a compromise package proposal which , on the one hand , allows advanced nations to use the total area of green resources , such as forests and vegetation , to make up for their emission cuts ; on the other hand , the proposal also makes advanced nations promise to provide investment for developing countries for environmental protection purposes .  That was how an agreement on controlling greenhouse gas emissions was finally reached .  
In the past few days Comrades attending a study meeting of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee 's central theoretical study group freely talked , in the context of the CPC 's 80-year glorious course since its founding and of carrying forward and developing the good traditions and work style of the old revolutionary base of Shandong , about what they had learned from the study of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the party founding anniversary .  
They should adapt to the new situation in the context of developing a socialist market economy and free themselves , once and for all , from the ideas , concepts , and approaches of work formed under the system of planned economy .

Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
An economic and trade delegation of the Chinese Government , headed by He Xiaowei , assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , paid an official visit to Macedonia on 29-30 July . During the visit , the delegation discussed with the Macedonian side on the issue of resuming and developing bilateral economic and trade relations , held talks with Mazuowa , undersecretary of the Macedonian Ministry of Economy , and also met Filipovski , deputy prime minister in charge of economic cooperation .  
Economic globalization has promoted the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the world economy but also brought many major problems , the most salient of which is that development in various countries is ever more uneven , the gap between North and South , or between the rich and the poor , has further widened , and the economic security and sovereignty of developing countries are facing unprecedented pressures and challenges .  
Even after winning their political independence , developing countries were still unable to achieve economic independence and an equal position in the international market ; as a result , the irrational North-South relationship has formed in which countries in the North have economically ( also politically to a considerable extent ) controlled and exploited developing countries in the South , the North has become increasingly rich , and the South increasingly poor .  
It was an important material foundation for economic growth , technological progress , and social stability in the developed countries after World War II , where lay the crucial reason for the economic backwardness and social poverty of developing countries .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
He said , developing good neighborly and friendly relations between the DPRK and Russia is in the fundamental interests of both countries , and there are tremendous potentials for bilateral cooperation in the economic , military , and cultural fields .  
Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the vast number of intellectuals has demonstrated their unprecedented initiative and creativity .  Scientists and technical experts , taking aim at the world 's cutting-edge technologies , are working with daring in scaling the heights of science and technology ; and they have achieved great successes in developing proprietary high technologies , which are close to or have reached the world 's advanced levels .  
Government departments must concentrate their energy in doing well macroeconomic control and creating a fine market environment .  In accordance with the demands of government operations laws and economic development laws , we must adjust the direct intervention of government in economic activities , changing the scope of this involvement to a more rational level , such as primarily organizing the production of public goods , developing public benefit undertakings , and providing public services .  
We should learn from them their true political qualities of carrying forward and developing the glorious traditions of our party and our army , consciously resisting temptations , firmly holding the defense line , and always " resisting and keeping away from corrosive influences . "  We should learn from them their up-to-the-mark work style of running the inspection post strictly , ensuring a strict enforcement of the law , stressing on decorum , and observing discipline .  
Investment projects in these areas will include building roads and water and power supply systems in the rural areas , building permanent and semi-permanent housings for herdsmen in a way according to the local situations , intensifying comprehensive agricultural development , and developing the Brahmaputra [ the Yaluzangbu Jiang ] and two other rivers , as well as developing animal husbandry in northern Tibet .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is the inherent demand for putting the important idea of " three represents " into practice and for vigorously developing China 's advanced culture .  Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is necessary in order to build and perfect the socialist market economy system and to meet the challenges brought about by China 's accession to the World Trade Organization . Rectifying and standardizing the cultural market order is also necessary in order to purify the social environment and to guarantee that the masses of young people grow up healthily .  
We must do a good job in resolving problems of the current livelihood and long-term production development for peasants where farmland is bring returned to forest , and support the peasants in developing industries for which there are strong local resources and which meet market needs ; through developing small hydroelectric stations , methane , and so on , we should resolve the problems of the peasants ' fuel and rural energy , prevent indiscriminate tree-felling , and protect the results of returning farmland to forest .  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that speeding up the perfection of the social security system is the urgent requirement of preserving social stability and consolidating and developing the current good development momentum , and is also a strategic move for achieving lasting political stability .  
Moreover , the functions of the SDF 's weapons have also been changing rapidly from " defensive " to " offensive . "  Besides the weapons that will be researched and developed with major efforts as stipulated in the " Guidelines on R &amp; D Implementation , " Japan will regard developing its armament as its principal tasks in the future .  It will equip with highly mobile armored combat vehicles .  
Because Japanese society widely considers that neighboring countries all have requests and think that Japanese economic aid and science and technology are critical to many developing Asian nations , therefore even if people have been " offended " on the historical issue , this is of no significance and will not hinder Japan from becoming an " international country , " to the point of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council .  
He was very happy to learn that a large number of peasants had extricated themselves from poverty and become rich through growing Chinese medicinal herbs and promoting special livestock breeding .  Hu Jintao said : Yanbian is richly endowed by nature and enjoys good prospects in developing industries along specialized lines .  
The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
Indeed , the regiment 's " red unit " and " blue unit " managed to refine each other 's tactics step by step during each round of fighting , by exposing each other 's loopholes , refining each other 's tactics , improving each other 's training plans , developing new tactics , and conducting training in light of a real war .  
Zhang Deguang said , as a result of more than 10 years of accumulated experience , China and Russia have built a whole set of effective mechanisms for developing good neighborliness , friendship , and strategic coordination , from the periodic meetings of their heads of state and heads of government to bilateral direct contacts between counterpart departments .  These mechanisms involve various fields such as politics , economics , and science and technology , and they are being more and more perfected and standardized .  
He said : China persistently pursues an independent and peace-oriented foreign policy , developing friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence , treating each other equally , enjoying mutual benefits , and jointly forging ahead the cause of human progress .  
However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .  So it is urgently needed to enact a complete law on real right .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
In respect of science , education , and qualified personnel , it is necessary to strengthen compulsory and elementary education , make a breakthrough in developing high-tech projects , import qualified personnel from other regions and , at the same time , train local talented personnel , bringing into full play the initiative of the existing talent .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
Those attending the forum said : President Jiang Zemin 's speech gave a systematic , complete , and incisive explanation on Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " and put forward an eight-point proposal for further developing cross-strait relations and promoting the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland in the current stage .  This fully reflected the determination and sincerity of the CPC and the Chinese Government to develop cross-strait relations and promote the reunification of the motherland and expressed all the Chinese people 's aspiration for reunification .  
The article stresses : As the " Taiwan Security Enhancement Act " bill has directly undermined all the efforts of China and the United States in improving and developing bilateral relations since they established diplomatic relations in 1979 , violated the " one-China " principled stand , and directly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  In reality , not only can Taiwan 's security not be ensured , but it will also intensify the situation in the Taiwan Strait and regional arms race and further push Taiwan toward war .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
According to the plan of the China Power Company , in the next 15 years , China will lay stress on developing hydropower plants in the western region .  The goal is to realize " sending electric power from the west to the east " and establish a national joint power supply network .  
As analyzed by a pertinent expert , the reasons for the negative growth of foreign capital actually used in China last year were as follows : 1 ) Tremendous changes have taken place in the mode of international capital movement , and the international funds have returned to the developed countries , leading to the decline of direct investment in the developing countries .  
However , it was utterly impossible for China , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .

Minister Zhu said that the reason for prominently emphasizing further strengthening technological renovation and regarding technological renovation , developing high technology , and realizing the industrialization of high technology as work that has a bearing on the future and destiny of the country is closely related to the changes in the general international economic environment and the fact that China 's economy and technology have developed to a considerable stage .  
We should realize that more than half of China 's 20 [ as published ] or so counties are in financial dire straits and are economically backward .  If the county towns ' economies make some progress , there will be hope for radical improvement in the Chinese economy .  Therefore in the new round of economic development , we should put our energy into developing the county towns .  
By the end of 1997 , there were 7,617 environmental protection enterprises in China , with the total fixed assets amounting to 62.09 billion yuan .  They have formed a pattern under which the state-owned enterprises are developing alongside the township collective enterprises and private enterprises .  
In the developing countries , the rise of commodity prices as a result of the growing financial deficits is mainly attributed to the lack of material reserves .  In the mainland , the commodity prices are falling now , and the situation is different from that in other developing countries , because it has sufficient material reserves , which will not give rise to a new round of inflation .  There is not any sign of a new round of inflation in the mainland at present .  
Facts have proved that the " one country , two systems " concept is not utopia or an expedient measure .  It is a scientific idea with great vitality and more room for development .  It is the only way out for a developing country to settle the problems left over from history and solidify and arouse all forces that can be aroused to make the country more powerful and prosperous .  
In the past year , while developing its economy and improving the people 's standard of living , China has also attached great importance to building democracy and the legal system as well as to promoting and protecting civil and political rights .  
emphasizing priority areas of scientific and technological development , an approach under which the state should give priority support to strategically significant technologies , support production enterprises with high and new technologies , and support , on a priority basis , the work of developing techniques with high technological levels which lead the world in the relevant research fields , which contain creative elements capable of establishing new scientific and technological bases , and which have been generally recognized at home and abroad .  
Since his assuming the post of the chairman of the government in September last year and becoming the acting president at the end of December , Putin has repeatedly expressed that he will persist in developing and deepening the Sino-Russia strategic partnership of cooperation [ zhong e zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi 0022 0192 2096 3970 0588 0155 0129 0133 7070 0190 ] and will consider Sino-Russian relations as the cornerstone of Russian foreign affairs .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
In agricultural production , on the basis of protecting the production capability of grain and other essential agricultural products , stress should be put on the optimization of varieties and the enhancement of quality and efficiency with a view to comprehensively optimizing crop varieties , painstakingly raising the quality of agricultural produce , positively developing animal husbandry and aquaculture , heightening the added value transformed from the processing of agricultural produce , and repeatedly increasing peasants ' income .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .  
That the United States has always ignored facts , played the same old tune , and slandered the situation of human rights in China and other developing countries is caused by its hegemonic mental state of Cold War mentality .

We should discard as soon as possible the old method of relying on the pricing mechanism and replace it with a new strategy : increasing the input of production elements , including capital , manpower , science and technology ; developing high-yield , special , and fine-quality agriculture as well as environment-friendly green agriculture ; raising the per-unit-area output of farm produce ; lowering production costs ; increasing returns ; and boosting farmers ' income without changing the procurement prices for agricultural products .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .

We must comport ourselves like Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , being undaunted by setbacks , not fearing any difficulties or adversity , staunchly developing the common ideal of socialism with special Chinese characteristics .  In the advance of reform and economic development , we must fully confidentially complete the lofty mission bestowed upon us by history and the times .  
Introducing the practice of a comprehensive agricultural development which mainly aims at strengthening the building of basic agricultural facilities , protecting and improving the ecological environment , and developing a high-quality agriculture with a high yield and a high efficiency conforms to the requirements of the WTO 's " green box " policy ; and is also an important way for the government to support and protect agriculture at a time when China 's agriculture is heading for internationalization , he stressed .  
Chi Haotian said : Since China and Azerbaijan established diplomatic ties , bilateral ties have developed smoothly .  The Chinese armed forces have paid attention to developing friendly ties with the Azerbaijani armed forces .

President Jiang also profoundly analyzed the impact of economic globalization on human society , and appealed to the international community to adopt practical and effective measures to open markets to the developing countries , transfer technology , reduce and waive debt , and increase official development aid , so as to narrow the north-south gap .  
The course of developing our bilateral relations in the nine years since China and Estonia established diplomatic ties shows that the bilateral relations can develop smoothly as long as both sides strictly adhere to the principle of mutual respect , mutual benefit on an equal footing , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality among all countries regardless of size , and abide by the spirit of the China-Estonia Joint Communique and Joint Statement on Establishment of Diplomatic Relations .

It is expected : During the " Ninth Five-Year Plan " period , China will in total have attracted $ 230 billion of foreign capital , nearly 100 percent more than in the " Eighth Five-Year Plan " period .  For seven consecutive years since 1993 , China has been the champion among developing countries for attracting foreign capital .  
Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , our Party has led the people in the unwavering promotion of reforms of the economic and political systems , establishing and promoting a socialist market economy system , developing socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics , and liberating and developing the social productive forces to the maximum , raising China 's overall national strength to a new level .

Jiang Zemin said that western development is a vast systems engineering , which is related to developing our vast land and also involves the production and daily life of the multiethnic masses ; it has to promote economic construction , and also achieve coordinated economic , resource , population , cultural , and environmental development ; there are very many strands to this work , which is very complex and arduous .  
From the automobile industry to the civil aviation industry , and to sales of color televisions , enterprises , facing fierce market competition , are flaunting the banner of " developing national industries and standardizing market competition . "  They have conducted various summits and formed price alliances to formulate minimum prices or maintain prices .  The trend of the practice of industrial monopolies is growing bigger and stronger .  
Over the past seven years , China is the developing country that attracts most foreign capital .  Constantly developing China is the indispensable and major part in the development of the economic globalization .  China 's joining the world trade organization will inject new vitality and dynamism into the economic globalization , expand new development space , is conducive to the joint development of China 's and world economical development , which will not only benefit China 's economy but also world 's economy .  
enable the Chinese enterprises to carry out international trade and economic cooperation in line with the principle of multilateral , stable , and unconditional most-favored-nation treatment to the WTO members ; be conducive to China developing its relatively advantageous sectors ; and is of major significance for China to enjoy the benefits brought by the multilateral trade system and by the economic globalization .  
While intensifying economic legislation , we should have a good grasp of the legislative work in terms of education , science and technology , culture , and so on with a view to creating a favorable legal environment and providing complete legal protection for developing China 's advanced culture , promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization , and carrying out the strategy of rejuvenating the country on the strength of science and culture .

He expressed the hope that indomitable efforts would be continued on the basis of these achievements so as to make the capital still better .  
He said that the international community should change the state of affairs where the actual policymaking power of major multilateral economic organizations have long been held in the hands of a few countries ; instead , the large number of developing countries should have a say in the policymaking process , rather than merely accept in a passive manner the rules formulated by others .  
Wang Yingfan noted that developed countries should further open their markets to developing countries , meet at the earliest possible date the target of raising their official development aid to 0.7 percent of their gross national product , and fully and effectively solve the foreign-debt problem of developing countries .

At a news conference held for the " China-Africa Cooperation Forum-Ministerial Meeting in Beijing in the Year 2000 , " Ji Peiding said the current meeting has two main topics : One is how to promote the establishment of a just and reasonable international political and economic new order geared to the needs of the 21st century in order to protect the common interests of developing countries , and the second is how to further strengthen cooperation between China and Africa in economic and other tangible fields .  
In line with the aim of " consultation on an equal footing , increasing understanding , expanding consensus , strengthening friendship , and promoting cooperation , " the two sides will jointly discuss major issues , such as how to push for the establishment of a new just and rational , international , political , and economic order geared to the 21st century ; how to safeguard the common interests of developing countries ; and how to further enhance Sino-African trade and economic cooperation .

He said that an important issue much emphasized in the new Five-Year Plan China has formulated is developing science and technology , because scientific and technological advance is an enormous motivation to promote the various undertakings of the state , enhance the overall national strength , and improve people 's living standard .  
The rational use and protection of nature , supporting world peace and promoting mutual development , and raising the standard of living in every country , especially the developing countries , will require even more talented engineers and technicians with creative spirits , and it will also require that the engineers and technicians of every country further strengthen their exchanges and cooperation .  
Recently , Japan 's business circles have expressed their optimism in the correct macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government to maintain the sustainable and rapid growth of the national economy and have shown keen interest in the new situation of China 's imminent entry into the WTO and its implementation of the strategy of developing the western region .  
Factors still exist that threaten peace and hamper development , however , and the current unfairness and irrationalities in the present international order do harm to the independence , sovereignty , and security of the developing countries , while disparities between south and north and poor and rich have further expanded .  
Despite the changing international environment , the two countries have understood and supported each other since the establishment of diplomatic relations more than 40 years ago .  The two countries have had fruitful cooperation in political , economic , military , and other areas , setting a model for South-South cooperation among developing countries .  
The fact that such a large number of world economic magnates will assemble under the banner of developing China 's vast western region suffices to prove that the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision to develop the western region is wise , well-timed , and full of great potential .  
Jimzhong Gyaincain Puncog said with deep feeling that 50 years later , Qamdo is no longer the same as before .  A new Qamdo , where the economy is developing , society is advancing , the political situation is stable , the people of all nationalities are united , and the people live and work in peace and contentment , stands like a giant on Sanjiang Plain .  
It should be soberly noted , however , that ours is a developing country with a population of 1.2 billion , a weak economic foundation , and uneven regional economic development , that our per capita output value is not high , and that the gap between our country and developed countries remains very wide .  
The bilateral relations have been developing smoothly with the joint efforts of the two sides since China and Cuba established diplomatic relations 40 years ago .  The two countries have also enhanced their mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields .  
Wen Jiabao stressed that the key to developing agricultural and rural economy and pushing forward agricultural modernization lies in the implementation of the strategy to invigorate agriculture on the strength of science and culture and place the training of qualified personnel in a prominent position .  
Therefore , we should make reform run through various aspects with a view to precipitating economic development , promoting structural adjustment , propelling market development , and opening wider to the outside world ; constantly perfect various structures that are suited to the requirements for developing the socialist market economic structure ; and break through the obstacles restricting the development of productive forces , which still exist in the current production relationship , in order to provide endless motive power to the economic development .  
The other characteristic is that industrial structural readjustment is carried out with a view to not only continuing the completion of industrialization and the shift of agricultural labor to non-farming sectors through industrialization but also propelling industrialization with informationization , transforming and upgrading the traditional agriculture and industry , and vigorously developing the modern tertiary industry that uses more science and technology and provides greater avenues for employment .  
We should take a lead in socialist spiritual civilization construction .  We should further foster close ties between the military and the government as well as between the military and the people .  We should continuously make new contributions in promoting coordinated economic and social development , in consolidating and developing China 's political stability , and in creating a good situation of social stability .  
With rich tourist resources , a solid cultural foundation , a relatively developed economy , and good experience in opening up to the outside world , Qian Qichen said that Zhejiang enjoys a superior geographical location and has advantages for developing tourism , foreign tourism in particular .  
He said : Syria is one of the first Arab states that established diplomatic ties with China . It is also an important and influential country in the Middle East . China has all along attached importance to developing friendly relations with Syria and has spoken highly of Syria 's long-term firm support for China on the issues of human rights and Taiwan .  
He said : While globalization is developing rapidly , the global management system is obviously lagging behind .  There is an urgent need for the international community to formulate coherent and effective management strategies , conduct reforms on current global economic system , so that the system will represent the interests of the great majority .  Accordingly , it will be guaranteed that all countries , especially the developing countries , will be able to enjoy the benefits fairly brought about by globalization , so as to realize the goal of eliminating poverty and achieving sustained development .  
Facing the increasing pressure , it is necessary that the developing countries make great efforts to overcome difficulties , base themselves on the specific national conditions of their own , adopt feasible development strategies , and work hard to eliminate poverty and achieve sustained development .  
On the contrary , since the new economies , which have knowledge as the basis , are mainly grouped in the developed countries , and the people of most developing countries are still living in poverty without any chances at all of getting in contact with the revolution of information technology , the differences between the south and north have been further expanded instead due to the " digital gap , " which has thrown a gloom over the prospects of common development and prosperity for the mankind .  
China has consistently attached importance to its relations with Mongolia , and is willing to make unremitting efforts for consolidating and developing long-term and stable Sino-Mongolian good neighborly and friendly cooperative relations which is healthy , based on mutual trust , and geared toward the 21st century .  
Wei Jianxing reiterated that the CPC is willing to develop fresh inter-party exchange and cooperation with the MPRP on the principle of independence and self-determination , total equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in domestic affairs , so as to make new contributions to developing Sino-Mongolian good neighborly and friendly cooperative relations .  
I hope the vast number of companies involved in every link of modern logistics , including procurement , manufacturing , storage , transportation , consignment , delivery , and marketing , would seize the good opportunity to learn from the advanced experience of developed countries in developing modern logistics , integrate the experience with China 's reality , work hard to explore , push forward the integration of modern logistics and E-Commerce in China , and raise the level of China 's modern logistics as quickly as possible .  
Today [ 29 October ] Guo Jinlong , newly appointed secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee , pointed out the need to continue the in-depth implementation of Tibet 's work principle in the new period ; that is , " taking economic construction as the center , focusing on the two major tasks of developing the economy and stabilizing the situation , and ensuring Tibet 's rapid economic development , its comprehensive social progress and lasting political stability , and the rising living standard . "  The stability and continuity of the policy should be maintained .  
We should seize the two major opportunities where the state is implementing the strategy of actively developing China 's west regions and where Tibet is stable socially .  Furthermore , we should apply creative concepts and systems as well as innovative science and technology to attain economic and social progress by leaps and bounds .  To constantly represent the orientation for the progress of China 's advanced culture , we have to carry out the following tasks : We should establish a Marxist cultural concept .  
We should persistently rectify and eliminate chaos and ignorance .  We should establish constructive models while eliminating negative ones in accordance with the policy of promoting positive examples while discarding bad elements .  We should correctly handle the ties between the inheritance and creation of nationalities ' traditional culture , increase cultural exchanges among fraternal nationalities , absorb the accomplishments of all the civilizations of mankind , and upgrade the educational level of Tibet 's various nationalities so as to provide powerful spiritual driving force and intellectual support for developing Tibet into a new socialist region .  
Li Peng pointed out : Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , guided by the basic principle of developing the socialist democracy and amplifying the socialist legal system proposed by the party 's central committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping , China 's legislative work has scored spectacular achievements .  
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
The local people 's governments at all levels should adopt preferential policies for , offer financial support to , and step up supervision and management of the work of vocational education and training for demobilized servicemen and may also accept and settle in a planned way and in light of the needs of developing the western regions on a large scale some outstanding professional personnel among demobilized servicemen in the western regions . 
Wang Liheng indicated that in the future , the corporation will give priority to developing communications satellites , natural resources satellites , meteorological satellites , disaster reduction satellites , a system of satellites to forecast and appraise small satellites , and the ground application system .  It will also give priority to building a space-ground infrastructure information system with the applied satellites as the major platform and to utilizing space technology to solve the difficult and hot issues emerging in national economic and social development .  
He said : The intensification of capacity building will help the developing member countries better participate in the new round of talks and also help various members better carry out the WTO agreements .  He hopes that APEC will draw up a set of comprehensive work plans aiming at something definite , carry out activities of technological cooperation in a positive and pragmatic attitude , and help the developing member countries enhance their ability in participating in negotiations and implementing the WTO agreements .  
In addition to the joint announcement that has important meaning for developing the relationship between China and Laos , the relative departments of the two countries signed an agreement on economic technology , a summary of the first meeting of the economic trade skill cooperation committees , exchange notes for China agreeing to undertake Luang Prabang hospital items , an agreement to develop leopoldite resources in the Vientiane area , and an memorandum of understanding for agricultural cooperation .  There are altogether six bilateral cooperative documents .  
4 .  The two sides attach great importance to developing their bilateral economic and trade relations .  They agree to explore all the possibilities of expanding these relations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and pursuant to the relevant national and international laws for the benefit of both sides .  
Also , both China and Thailand are developing countries and both are facing the arduous tasks of developing our respective economies and improving our peoples ' living standard .  We hold identical or close viewpoints on many important regional and global issues .  
Shi Guangsheng added : APEC should impel the WTO to work out an agenda for the new round of talks , which will balance and reflect the interests of all parties , those of the developing member countries in particular , resolve the problems that the vast number of developing countries are concerned about , and strive to make the results of talks conducive to the establishment of a still fairer and opener multilateral trade structure , so as to play a positive role in promoting the economic development of all member countries .  
The important purpose of systemic innovation is to overcome the factors in the relations of production and the superstructure that hinder the development of the productive forces and to keep liberating and developing the productive forces .  We should uphold the basic economic system under which the socialist public ownership is dominant while economic sectors of diverse forms of ownership develop side by side ;  
He said that China and Sudan have a common language on many issues and are faced with the complex and ever-changing international situation ; the Chinese side is willing to continue increasing coordination and cooperation with Sudan and make concerted efforts to establish a new international political and economic order characterized by fairness and rationality , and to safeguard the common interests of the developing countries .  
The broad mass of developing countries face the arduous dual tasks of not only having to exert great efforts to transform their traditional industries but also striving to develop new industries , or it will be hard for them to realize virtuous development of their economies and to deal with harsh challenges brought about by the development of the global economy . 
Wei Jianxing added : China and the Dominican Republic are developing countries .  We are devoted to defending world peace , invigorating our national economy and improving our people 's living standard .  
They stressed that a healthy and fair multilateral trade system will improve the sustainable and stable growth of world trade and promote common prosperity for both the developed nations and the developing nations .  
As President Jiang Zemin pointed out , whatever difficulties there are in Sino-US relations , so long as the governments and leaders of the two countries have strong confidence and resolve in developing their bilateral ties , dare to face the challenges and difficulties , be bold in clearing away various kinds of interference and obstacle , hold firm to the main orientation of the development of their bilateral ties , maintain close contact , and stop up consultation , they will be able to push the continual development of bilateral ties .  
His Majesty Sultan 's successful visit to China last year and the " Joint Communiqu " the two countries issued on future bilateral cooperation clearly defined the orientation of further developing the good-neighborly , friendly , and cooperative bilateral relations based on mutual trust and support .  
As a major power in the Arab world and Africa , Wu said , Egypt has played an important role in regional and global affairs .  Egypt has won widespread acclaim for maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East region and the world at large , strengthening unity among the Arab and African nations , and promoting and developing common prosperity of the developing nations .  
Shi Guangsheng said that although the bilateral trade value still accounts for a small proportion in the current foreign trade volumes of the two countries , China and Bahrain have great potential for further developing trade , contractual projects , cooperative labor services , and investment .  Thus , the two sides should make concerted efforts to promote various forms of mutual beneficial cooperation between enterprises of the two countries and to promote a greater development of bilateral economic and trade relations in the new century .  
Chi Haotian said : China has attached great importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with Tunisia . China will adhere to the basic principle of " being sincere and friendly to each other , treating each other as equals , maintaining unity and cooperation , seeking common development , and facing the future , " and will jointly build a new long-term , stable , and comprehensive cooperative partnership with African countries to gear to the needs of the 21st century .  
Liu Jiang emphasized that developed countries must take practical actions to perform their commitments according to the convention in technology transfer and financial support and in satisfying specific needs of developing countries so as to narrow the widening South-North wealth gap and science and technology gap and realistically solve the climate change problem .  
China , as a developing country , has likewise made tremendous efforts to tackle the climate change problem .  Compared with 1990 , the energy consumption per 10,000 yuan GDP in China dropped 50 percent in 1999 and the share of coal in total primary energy consumption decreased 9.1 percent , while the use of biomass , solar , wind , geothermal energies and other new and renewable energy sources was over the equivalent of 300 million tons of standard coal .  From 1990 to 2000 , 52.73 million hectares of forests have been planted in China .  
Wu Bangguo said : Ever since Kuwait and China established diplomatic relations in 1971 , the friendly cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , trade , petroleum , and cultural spheres has been fruitful .

On bilateral relations , Tang Jiaxuan indicated the Chinese side 's readiness to continue to develop friendly cooperative relations with Iraq in the political , economic , and cultural fields ; to strengthen mutual visits at all levels ; and , in particular , to make greater efforts in developing economic and trade relations .  
While their own countries carry out massive activities aimed at prohibiting smoking , developed countries on the contrary encourage sales of tobacco products to developing countries .  The majority of developed countries not only have not kept to their own promises regarding increasing official developmental support in international society , but have attempted through technological monopoly and trade barriers to conduct a " new economic colonialism " .  
The Communist Party of China , which is now leading the Chinese people to carry out reform , opening up , and socialist modernization construction , is willing to continue developing friendly and cooperative relations with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation on the basis of the principle of " independence , autonomy , complete equality , mutual respect , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs . "  
Shanghai 's decision-makers began to open the gate to liberalize their thinking and lost no time in coming up with a new industrial strategy to " give priority to developing the tertiary industry , readjust and transform the secondary industry , and steadily upgrade the primary industry . "  It boldly changed the several-decade-old " 2-3-1 " industrial development order to the " 3-2-1 " order .  
Over the past 20-odd years since reform and opening up , considerable headway has been made in developing socialist democracy and perfecting the socialist legal system in China , and the framework of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics that takes the constitution as the core has shaped up , which has laid a solid foundation for the practice of governing the country according to law and the building of a socialist country ruled by law .  
With reference to these issues , the city party committee organized people concerned to earnestly study relevant documents and analyze the case example of former city mayor Mo Miaorong who took up the road of crime , and let the people concerned understand that under the new situation of carrying out reform and opening up and developing socialist market economy , in order to keep cool-headedness and withstand rigorous tests , leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy tendencies . 
With reference to the disastrous consequences brought about by the drastic changes in the former Soviet Union and East Europe to the countries and peoples there as well as the development of the socialist undertakings since the founding of PRC 50 years ago , especially the brilliant achievements attained since reform and opening up over the last 20 years in China , they more deeply understand that the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only correct road for consolidating and developing socialism in China , realizing national rejuvenation , and making China powerful and prosperous .  
As developing countries , China and Armenia should strengthen cooperation ; in light of their respective strong points , they should explore together new ways and spheres of economic and trade cooperation suited to their national conditions and also to the laws of market economy and international convention , and promote the all-round development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation . 
Long Yongtu said : The increasing flow of foreign capital into China is neither based on the condition of decreasing the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries , nor will it have a significant impact on the flow of foreign capital into other developing countries .  Currently , the world 's foreign capital is mainly flowing into developed countries .  
It is not likely that the additional foreign capital that has flowed into China will change the general pattern of the capital flow in the world , or affect the amount of foreign capital flowing into developing countries .  A large project given to China may give rise to the construction of supporting production networks in surrounding countries , thereby enabling these countries to obtain even more foreign capital .  This shows even more clearly the economic ties and complementary nature of China and other developing countries .  
In the new century , the party 's basic requirements for the united front are to hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , unite with all forces that can be united , bring all positive factors into play , and turn native factors into positive ones to serve the purposes of developing socialist economics , politics , and culture with Chinese characteristics , maintaining the political situation characterized by unity and stability , realizing the complete reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : The united front has assembled a large number of intellectuals , experts , and scholars who have been playing an important role in inheriting and developing the fine cultural tradition of the Chinese nation , learning from and drawing on the advanced scientific , technological , and cultural achievements of other countries , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
It is even more serious that where there is oppression , there is resistance , which is an ironclad law in history .  The waves of impoverished developing countries opposing the developed countries headed by the United States will certainly surge higher and higher , class struggle will move from a country to the entire world , and the era of peace and development will come to an end , which will be replaced by the new round of revolution and war on a global scale .  
These associations have not only become new forces , but have also played a more important role in supporting and developing poor areas , serving the community , carrying out ideological and political work in the grass roots , and building democracy , the legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
As far as developing countries are concerned , the benefits brought by TNCs are plain to see ; for instance , they have made tremendous contributions to promoting economic development in the host countries , providing job opportunities , introducing advanced technology and management experience , stimulating the development of trade , perfecting the market structure , improving competitiveness , and so on , and many countries have enthusiastically opened their doors to these companies .  
In recent years foreign investment by developed countries has tended to be concentrated in a number of sectors which require small investment , yield high profit , and are regionally concentrated ; this not only runs counter to the goal of the host countries in making efforts to develop hi-tech industry , but is also extremely prone to result in foreigners controlling the pattern of industry and domestic market , and this directly endangers the economic lifelines of the developing countries .  
Sichuan has actively implemented the strategic policy decisions of the central authorities regarding the " great development of the western region , " and has put forth the overall working idea of building Sichuan - - with 10 years of struggle - - into an economic powerhouse province in China 's western region and an ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , of harmoniously developing the economy and society , and of realizing new strides . 
For one reason or another , however , underworld evil forces are still developing and spreading in some localities in these years , and they are swollen with arrogance .  Where such forces are rampant , people dare not report to the authorities the crimes committed by these forces and make complaints about their sufferings .  Now , underworld evil forces of one kind or another have gravely jeopardized the safety of our people 's life and property and seriously disrupted our socialist market economy and social order .  
With respect to the reform of the circulation methods , we must put the emphasis on promoting chain operations , material circulation and allocation and delivery , multi-formatted through-transport , and other organizational forms and service formats .  Today , it is especially important to pay attention to developing material circulation and allocation and delivery and use modern management methods and service techniques to transform traditional commerce and increase the technological content and raise service standard to promote the rise in the overall standard of the circulation industry .  
China 's economic development potentials and its vast potential market , the unique role it plays in Asian affairs , its political influence among the developing countries , its special geopolitical status and future prospects of " great China " [ da zhong hua ] , and the acceleration of its military modernization - - all these factors mean that the US government and public can not but attach greater importance to China 's weight in the future international political pattern and its influence in world affairs .  
An editorial published by the party organ newspaper the same day particularly mentioned that " the united front includes an alliance of two scopes , that within and that outside the mainland , " " in particular the several score million overseas compatriots form a unique strong point in promoting China 's modernization and achieving the complete reunification of the motherland , and are also a unique strong point in developing friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of the world and promoting economic and cultural exchanges with countries the world over . "  
China 's relations with other major powers have continued to improve and develop , its good-neighborly and friendly cooperative relations with its neighboring countries have been further enriched , and its traditional friendship with the developing countries has been consolidated .  
In addition , after China enters the WTO , Guangzhou City will make six major adjustments in its policies such as introduction of foreign capital .  The six adjustments include : Import tariffs will be lowered by a large margin .  The average tariffs will be gradually lowered to a level equivalent to that of developing countries within two years after China 's WTO accession ;  
Huang Ju said that in the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , Shanghai will , while aiming for the goal and sticking to the mainline of raising the city 's comprehensive competitiveness , constantly raise the information technology , marketization , and rule-of-law levels that are worthy of the name of a metropolis that embarks on socialist modernization and that strives to become a big international city .  It will also make great efforts developing industrial sectors that produce high value-added products , that create business opportunities for other sectors , and that generate more employment .  
IV . To continue to strengthen bilateral cooperation and coordination at the United Nations , ASEAN Regional Forum , East Asia Cooperation , APEC , ASEM and other international and regional multilateral fronts and promote the solidarity and cooperation of the developing countries .

ISO 10646 and the Big-5 coding scheme ) .  In doing so , we seek to establish a common Chinese language interface so as to facilitate accurate electronic communication in Chinese . This has a positive effect on the development of Chinese computing .  
The course manual will be drawn up by experienced teachers on the basis of the recommendations of the working group , with individual modules on the operations of industries to be developed by relevant organisations in specific industries .  For example , the Tradelink Electronic Commerce Ltd and the Hong Kong Article Numbering Association are responsible for developing the modules on electronic data interchange operations and retail and warehouse operations respectively .  This will help ensure that the course contents will meet the requirements of the industries .  
Speaking at a meet-the-media session , Mr . Leung said the major new initiatives included setting up Customer Liaison Groups ; upgrading and integrating the public library services ; streamlining services for artistes and developing artistic identities for civic centres ; improving the heritage and museum services ; launching a Healthy Exercise for All Campaign ; introducing special fitness programme for over-weight children , senior citizens and disabled people ; setting up District Sports Teams ; and planting 60 000 trees in 2000 .  
( b ) of the numbers of conferences on investment policies and trade , as well as trade missions for foreign enterprises based in Hong Kong , that had been arranged respectively by the Industry Department and the TDC in collaboration with the central and local organisations in the Mainland over the past three years ; the number of projects for developing business and making investments in the Mainland by the enterprises concerned , which were finalised through such promotional efforts , and the industries and investment amounts involved in those projects ; and  
If we can become a pioneer in developing a set of innovative environmental protection technologies which are suitable for the region , we can help create a green and sustainable environment not only for our own future generations , but for our neighbours as well .  
We have worked hard since then to realise this goal .  This has included drafting and enacting new legislation ; selecting a strong team of financial institutions to prepare , manage and underwrite the Share Offer ; and developing a comprehensive advertising campaign , which starts tomorrow .  You have probably noticed some of the material already ; and we will preview the rest shortly .  
In the past 51 years , especially following the policy of economic reforms and opening up in the last two decades , our country has undergone fundamental changes .  The economy is developing rapidly ; social stability is maintained ; and the standard of living of the Chinese people is constantly improving .  
Since the country went ahead with reform and open door policy in 1978 , Hong Kong businesses have been actively involved in investment and trade in the coastal provinces , developing external trade in tandem with local enterprises .  Plenty of valuable experience has thus been gained which can be used for reference in the development of western region . " he added .  
Mr Tung said APEC Leaders had resolved to continue working in international forums to help shape the global economy and to provide a more secure and stable financial environment for developed and developing countries .  
Hong Kong is developing into a major regional hub of electronic commerce , with liberalized and well-established telecommunications infrastructure , a culture embracing information technology and new innovations , close relationship with the Mainland , and successful cooperation between the public and private sector in driving infrastructural and technological developments .  
It has also made developing countries more vulnerable to the impact of external economic turmoil and financial crises , as evidenced by the grave impact of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s on some Asian countries and regions . 
The decline of Tai Fu Tai is still a myth , but even before the British lease of the New Territories , in 1898 , the life at Tai Fu Tai had changed to a more village-life style , and the Man descendants , the owner of the mansion , then engaged in practical but still prosperous occupations , possibly developing some industries , like the soya-bean production , possibly in the annexe .  The various village-type activities required a firm paving in front though some of this may have been present earlier .  
At the Meeting , Ministers acknowledged the importance of helping SMEs enhance technological innovation through co-operation , and sharing of information and resources ; access finance through enhancing SMEs ' financial transparency and identifying new financing channels ; and creating a favourable business environment conducive to starting and developing businesses .  
Also speaking at the opening ceremony , the Commissioner for Labour , Mrs Tan Kam Mi-wah , said : " The theme of today 's workshop is ' Developing decent and sustainable youth employment ' .  The theme was set in response to the ILO 's global policy of developing decent work for the youth , and is in perfect accord with the concept of lifelong learning prevailing in Hong Kong . "  
These included the development by the Hospital Authority ( " HA " ) of a set of patient referral guidelines which would assist not only internal referrals within HA but also where appropriate , externally to the private sector ; the identification and development of shared care programmes ; the dissemination of information on private sector services through the assistance of HA ; and the possibility of developing a medical insurance scheme for new civil service recruits with the participation of the private sector , etc . 
For our economy to remain vibrant and competitive , we must upgrade the calibre of our human capital and ensure the sustainability of our economic and social development by developing a comprehensive population policy and attracting more talents to Hong Kong , with due regard to the direction of our economic development , talent demand , land resources , migration figures ( including the number of arrivals from the Mainland ) , and the need to secure job opportunities for local workers .  
Since its inception by the WHO in 1980 , the ICDRA represents a very important and unique global forum at which national drug regulatory authorities from amongst the members states learn of international tendencies , discuss current issues , exchange point of view and draw up recommendations .  It also offers an unparalleled opportunity to promote collaboration between developed and developing countries .  
One of the main events associated with the summit was organised by the World Meteorological Organisation , and was concerned with developing guidelines to enable meteorological agencies to reduce the negative impacts of climate change , thereby contributing to sustainable development .  
In reply to a question I raised at the Legislative Council meeting held on November 13 this year , the Secretary for Home Affairs stated that to facilitate the promotion of sports and recreational pursuits , the Administration had , as at that date , granted 66 land leases at nominal premium to sports associations and non-profit making bodies for developing sports and recreational facilities for the benefit of the community at large .  
While many larger foreign enterprises have advantages in capital , human and technical resources , professional knowledge , experience in project management and implementation , and international connection , Hong Kong enterprises also enjoy unique strengths in developing the telecommunications and IT markets in the Mainland . 
These will include raising and speeding up the level of co-operation to realise our common goal of achieving a major modernised economic region , enhancing our co-ordination in regional infrastructure projects , strengthening our world-class logistics services , developing the western part of the PRD , and fully expanding our services industries .  There is scope to explore new areas of co-operation in the financial sector , in improving market regulation and in education .  
This enables MTRCL to commence work on the Project before the grant of the franchise , including developing a sufficient design for the System and its ancillary developments , carrying out requisite environmental and technical studies , and completing the necessary statutory procedures .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
Additionally , the government has prepared a " major program for developing the bastion of national revival " to expedite simultaneous implementation of medium-range and long-range economic , social and cultural plans over the next 10 years . "  
Taiwan 's electric fan manufacturers have dedicated themselves to developing a variety of convenient , high quality fans by improving their materials and design . Heavy aluminum or iron fan leaves have in the last 20 years been replaced by light , economical plastics .  
Countering this unfavorable impression was a report from an international meeting in West Germany which stated that the Republic of China on Taiwan was a model for all developing countries in its fight against existing counterfeiting groups . Concurrent with this was a feature in the Los Angeles Times which gave high marks to Taiwan in its struggle against the fraudulent counterfeiters . The article also stressed that it was categorically wrong to label Taiwan as a center of counterfeiting .  
In light of the recent outcry against the counterfeit industry in the Republic of China , there are several verified facts that have not been properly addressed . According to international trade reports the leaders among counterfeiters in developing nations is Morocco , while among the developed nations , Japan and Italy were the leading offenders .  
The venture capitalist on the other hand is always looking for new opportunities and will be willing to part with a company that is standing on it 's own financial feet . To sell interest in a commercial concern takes an organized market , Taiwan is also in the process of developing a reliable and stable stock market to reach this end .  
As the economy industrialized , however , domestic makers began to supply spare parts and accessories and maintenance services , gradually developing the ability to make simple goods , until today where the product range extends from machines that make instant noodles to those that manufacture concrete and chemical products .  
But the more rapidly changing East has faced greater challenges . Problems and achievements , the sweet and the bitter , have been mixed together like the coffee , cream , and sugar in a cup of instant coffee , and the boiling water poured on top has produced a fragrant but scalding concoction . The Republic of China is one of the most rapidly developing countries in Asia .  
After he completed his military service in 1966 , he got a job as a medical photographer at a U . S . Navy research institute in Taipei . During his twelve years there , he learned many photographic and developing techniques . In his free time he traveled around shooting pictures of people and places he found interesting , and he also got to know Teng Nan-kuang , whose influence resulted in a greater breadth and freedom in his work .  
Refining entails a great deal of pollution , but the supply of petrochemical materials is vital for developing the economy and improving the life of the citizenry , so production and growth were constantly increased . Today the site encompasses more than sixty refineries producing a wide range of fuels along with two upstream naphtha plants and some mid - and downstream facilities . Most eye-catching are the hundred-some smokestacks that spout flames day and night , as the facilities are operated round-the-clock to advance the economic growth of Taiwan .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
The negro slave trade once flourished as a means of developing the resources of Europe 's colonial territories ; with the worldwide abolition of slave trading in the middle nineteenth century , an alternative source of labor was identified in the Chinese .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
In Europe , many countries that have achieved a certain level of economic development have devoted more and more resources to advancing technology in medicine , environmental protection and other areas related to public welfare rather than engaging in the all-out pursuit of economic strength or military power . The Soviet Union , on the other hand , lagged way behind Europe , North America and Japan in developing consumer-oriented technology , but it was undeniably a scientific and technological power in terms of its achievements in military research and development . "  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
Hence , in discussing national security , transportation and other such issues , one can not merely turn one 's attention to technological choices . For example , in developing transportation we must pay attention to how future cars and airplanes will affect cities and the environment . In researching technology development plans for the future we must consider things from a global perspective . Such issues as environmental protection , technological support for the developing countries and the rational use of global resources can not be overlooked .  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
An IQ of from 50 to 70 is considered mildly retarded ; the focus of education is similar to that of ordinary children , with more emphasis on practical applied learning . People with IQs from 35 to 50 are classified as moderately retarded , with the focus of education placed on taking care of one 's own daily necessities , communication with others , developing job skills , and basic knowledge .  
Given that in some areas of Taiwan local residents have made a killing by developing the seafood industry by raising fish in nearby shallows , Lu Tao fishermen are even more unsettled because they are restricted from doing the same by the environmental protection regulations of the ECNSAA .  
Wang Chen-yi , secretary-general of the Association of Taiwanese Ballads , who has been to the mainland many times , contends that as ko-tzai-hsihas been developing for less than 100 years , it has the special characteristic of being thoroughly plain and simple . For example , singing is done in a natural voice , with the transitions gentle . Movements are smoother , more suave , closer to the style of southerners .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
The National Film Archive took the films to a developing company , which gave them an ultrasonic cleaning , repaired the sections that were ripped and falling apart and then used all sorts of special printing machines and chemical techniques to blow up the negatives one frame at a time . Now the films look pretty much like they did back when they were released . All told , in personnel and materials , it cost about NT $ 400,000 to have these films preserved for another 50 years . "  
On the one hand he hoped that his eldest daughter , who once dyed her hair purple and even planned to get herself tattooed , would start acting less like a foreigner and more like a Chinese ; but more importantly , over the last decade the North American economy had been going steadily downhill , while Taiwan had been developing far better than he had ever expected , and with family and contacts here , he thought that if his children returned they would have better chances for the future .  
But tidal land after all is n't like ordinary land . Although it escapes environmental protests and other social complications , there are a lot of " natural complications " that can arise by developing tidal lands : soft and muddy soil , erosion from the waves , climatic changes , and flooding . The difficulty of overcoming these challenges is no less than the other challenges on terra firma .  
The Tourism Bureau has been developing a recreational area in the woodland coastal area in Tungshih rural township in Chiayi County . They built a huge service center and parking lot in the area . Perhaps by the time they 're ready to open , the woodland will have withered because of destruction of the living environment . "  
When Lin Chung-cheng , an Academia Sinica researcher in social sciences , examined the early economic differences between native Taiwanese and mainlanders , he discovered that native businesses tended to take root among the general public and situate themselves in downstream manufacturing , while mainlander businesses were mostly developing upstream supply industries which could avoid the market weakness of insufficient human resources .  
Before the 1970s , ceramic art in Taiwan could only truly be considered a ceramics industry , and was still developing in terms of mass production . Not only was the pottery glazed with few colors , the rate of failure was high , and progress in design was halted at the stage of fake antique flower vases or exported decorative ceramic dolls .  
Later on , despite the establishment of formal governmental offices , the Ching court 's attitude toward Taiwan was merely " to insure that the island remained quiet and posed no threat , " but they had little enthusiasm for positively developing the island . This attitude is evident in the continuing ban on mainland Chinese emigrating to Taiwan even after the integration of the island into the imperial bureaucratic system . ( People got to Taiwan only because the law was not strictly enforced . )  
In this period , the Central Cross Island Highway and the Shihmen and Tsengwen reservoirs were all completed . Nine-year compulsory education was implemented . Land reform continued : Farmland was rezoned and " equalization of urban land rights " put into effect . These laid the foundations for the transition from being a developing to being a developed country .  
Within these 20 years , there have been fundamental changes in the international and domestic situations . For example , the Soviet Union has collapsed and the Cold War is over . Within Taiwan , there has been political liberalization , economic transformagion from developing country to newly industrialized country status , and social pluralization . The authoritarian and rigid education methods of the past can not produce the leaders that society and the country will need in the future .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Thirty years ago , an American director and cinematographer named Morton Heilig , inspired by 3-D films , had the " wild idea " of developing a " total illusion of reality " which would encompass sight , smell , motion , and sound . He declared that audiences would enjoy complete and realistic sensory stimulation .  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi . And so whether one suffers from a sore back , nagging sore throat , or weak blood and qi ; whether one is male or female , old or young ; there are appropriate prescriptions containing turtle shell that vary according to age and condition .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
When we sat resting on the limestone rocks , gazing down on the little winding path below the mountain and looking up to the blue sky and white clouds , I could n't help fantasizing big economic development schemes to help the people of these remote mountains , like manufacturing Lian Mountain mineral water , bottling fresh Lian Mountain air , building a heliport , or developing a tourist business .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
But it was n't until 1860 , when Britain annexed Kowloon and took possession of the now famous Victoria Harbour , that Hong Kong took its place as a vital center of global trade . At that time , colonial business capital swarmed into Hong Kong 's harbor and urban areas , quickly developing them into an international trading center with British companies at its core . Nineteenth-century Western businesses , offices , residences , and warehouses sprang up , instantly transforming the face of this traditional Chinese fishing village .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
There are still many tasks for the future . Among the feasible directions for the gay movement would be establishing an information hotline especially for gay issues , making the homosexual movement broader and more in touch with the grass roots level , coordinating groups at various levels , and developing social commentary with a uniquely gay perspective .  
In order to achieve its new goals , the PRC has been buying or developing ( with the help of hired Russian experts ) SU-27 fighters , inter-continental ballistic missiles , and cruise missiles , and is forming a naval task force capable of independent operational capability . General Tang Fei , chief of the ROC general staff , judges that there are a number of objectives behind the PRC 's transformation of its military strategy .  
The PRC has an enormous undersea force and has been developing nuclear subs . Meanwhile , Taiwan has only four subs , two of which are re-fitted submarines used by the US in World War II ( they are outdated and useful only for training ) . The current ROC submarine force can not effectively undertake counter blockade missions . Therefore , the purchase of new submarines is urgent .  
Such projects included the building of the Shihmen and Tsengwen Reservoirs and the Central Cross-Island Highway . The provincial government implemented compulsory education through grade nine , encouraged development of coastal marshes and hilly districts , rezoned agricultural land , took steps to prevent excessive concentration of urban land ownership , built public housing , and developed industrial parks . All these measures were taken to create the conditions that would enable Taiwan to vault from the category of developing nation into the ranks of the newly industrialized economies .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
With its emphasis on " developing qi to relax the body , " and its loose , supple , slow physicality , taijiquan is a contrast to the usual types of exercise favored by today 's well-fed , sedentary city slickers with their hectic lifestyles-activities such as jogging , gym workouts , and aerobics , which contract the muscles and quicken the pulse .  
In recent years , all the countries that recognize the ROC have been small and medium-sized developing nations . Many of these nations receive long-term foreign aid , in the form of both technical missions and material assistance . This has resulted in frequent criticism about " checkbook diplomacy . " Since the ROC is an international trading powerhouse with excellent de facto relations with many nations , some people have even wondered why it is necessary to pursue formal diplomatic relations at all .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment . Thus there are many key technologies which can be developed , and the industry can sustain a large workforce . " CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
But just as with other natural resources , the greatest microbiological riches are concentrated in developing countries , and these poor countries do not have the means to screen their own resources and develop useful biological agents . But the major pharmaceutical companies of Europe and North America have long been gathering rich pickings from these countries , by collecting large quantities of soil , humus and plant samples to use in the search for new drugs . This has brought them substantial profits , but in the past the countries owning the resources benefited little .  
In the early days , most of the micro-organisms held by the center were types widely used internationally such as yeasts and red yeasts . But in recent years , in the interests of preserving biodiversity and protecting native resources , the center has reorganized and is directing the major part of its efforts towards developing native fungi . " Native and marine micro-organisms will be the main focus of our future work , " declares the center 's mission statement .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
Born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth and well acquainted with the finer privileges in life , she never attended a single day of school in the regular education system , but that has n't kept her from developing into one of Taiwan 's best inkwash artists .  
In seeking to answer this question , we poured our energies into building our economy , developing the so-called folk literature , and finding strength in the land where we live . In the process , we developed self-confidence . The severing of official diplomatic ties with the US in 1978 left us even further isolated from the international community , but we responded by redoubling our efforts and pulling together . A national consciousness began to take shape .  
Although nuclear power does not produce greenhouse gases , the controversies that rage over the safety of nuclear plants and the disposal of nuclear waste are prohibitive ; nor does the COP encourage countries to develop nuclear energy . Thus , " renewable energy " sources such as wind and solar power , despite the high costs of researching and developing these alternatives , are inevitable . Next year Taiwan Power Company will finally take the plunge and invest a large amount of money in a wind power program .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
In recent years , the AVRDC has also stepped up the economic evaluation of its projects , to assess the socio-economic benefits of improved vegetable varieties and growing methods . One of the major reasons for setting up the AVRDC was the hope that it could promote the cultivation of vegetables of a high nutritional value , to improve the nutritional status and quality of life for the people of many developing countries , and promote those countries ' overall national development .  
As Li Chen-ching explains , the MOE has decided this year to begin a special program for developing short-term researchers in key technology areas . Thirty-five spots will be funded for doctoral candidates recommended by their universities to go abroad to do research in 12 key areas-including nanotechnology , biotechnology , computer science , and microelectronics-for one year . Students need only have their application accepted , and they will be exempted from the normal exams for government scholarships .  
From finding things unacceptable , indecipherable , harsh , and nightmarish , they have been able to put aside their old postures and really change themselves , learning to re-examine themselves and accept new ways of speaking and acting . With the additional help of meditation , visualization , and relaxation exercises , they 've broken through mere habit by developing their inner potential .  
But a year ago when RollCoCo launched another set of cartoon characters called CoCoPlay , featuring four cheeky children wearing animal-head masks , they immediately drew adverse comments such as " Not funny ! " or " Kill them off , do n't make any more ! " so they naturally stopped developing the characters .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
However , when a person is infected by the TB bacillus , he will not usually immediately develop full-blown tuberculosis , and the bacterium may remain latent inside the body for a long period of time . Generally speaking , once infected , there is a roughly 10% chance of a person developing an active case during the rest of his life . Of those who do develop TB , half do so within five years of infection .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
Wu Huang , deputy secretary-general of the Energy Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs ( MOEA ) , explains further : " Precisely because the range of renewable energies is so diverse , each country has to direct its limited resources toward the development of selected areas in which it has an advantage . Thus Germany is developing wind power and Japan hydroelectric power . In Taiwan we hope to achieve a balanced development of hydro , wind , geothermal , biomass and photovoltaic energy sources . "  
Last year , after staff from the Formosa Plastics Group on an overseas inspection tour learned of this mechanism , the company decided to assist Vietnam in developing clean technologies such as cogeneration ( combined heat and power ) and tree planting , and then sell the resulting greenhouse gas reduction credits ( valued at US $ 10 per tonne ) to countries that need them , thus developing a new line of business .  
Since the 1990s ecotourism has exploded , especially in developing nations in Latin America , Africa and Asia where there are rain forests . These nations have established numerous nature preserves and national parks , and their outstanding natural resources and unique cultures have attracted growing numbers of tourists from the developed world .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
She begins by developing their understanding of their bodies through drawing their genitals , giving self-evaluations , charting menstrual cycles , learning to put on a condom , and studying other contraceptive methods before moving on to the psychological side with work on self-affirmation and interpersonal relations . Ultimately , she asks the students to confront the issues of birth , aging , illness and death by having them interview elderly persons , share their feelings about caring for grandparents who have been the victims of strokes , and write a living will .  
According to the godfather of Taiwan 's community colleges , Huang Wu-hsiung , society-based courses ' goal of guiding and shaping their students relies on four things-participation in social activities , confronting the issues facing society , developing a concern for the community , and helping students advance through concrete examples of the ideas and theories taught . Thus the biggest challenge facing community colleges is finding how to bring in people out of the workaday rat race and from sectors of the public who have never really given any concern to civic affairs .  
In order to maintain this environment while also developing the level of the more academic courses we provide , we 've decided that the best choice is to follow the example set by overseas adult education providers and adopt a " twin-track " system .  
" Back in the 1960s and 1970s , increasing food production was an important target of economic planning , " says former Council of Agriculture chairman Peng Tso-kwei . Developing mountain and marine food sources and developing marginal land were central to achieving this objective . The government even established a special Bureau of Mountain Agriculture and Animal Husbandry , as well as another agency to develop land reclaimed from the sea .  
China and the Philippines , both developing countries , are faced with the same task of developing the economy and improving the standard of living , Jiang said , and that both need a stable neighborly relationship and sound international environment  
The Sudan has very favourable natural conditions for its economic development , Qian said adding that in developing economy , a peaceful international environment and a stable domestic political order are very important  
Through international activities , the ACFTU has developed all round friendly relations with trade unions in other countries , strengthened traditional friendship with trade unions in developing nations , resumeed relations with Western trade unions , and improved relations with the three major international trade unions  
China has successfully withstood external political pressure and has scored rapid economic development , he said , adding that it has a traditional friendship with other developing countries and supports them in their demand for a just and equitable international economic order , and is providing assistance in funds and technology to them  
however , human rights include not only citizens ' political rights , but also economic , social and cultural rights , he said so far as large numbers of developing countries are concerned , he added , it is the rights to independence , subsistence and development that are of " paramount importance "  
Despite changes in the international situation , and in the domestic situations of both countries , friendly relations between China and Romania have been developing steadily since the two countries forged diplomatic ties 50 years ago , Li said , adding that the Chinese are happy over any progress made by Romania  
In the area of investment , there was already a growing pattern of investment among developing countries However , virtually all private direct foreign investment in the developing world had been concentrated on a short list of middle income countries  
the settlement of the question of population must always be closely integrated with the promotion of all round social and economic development for developing countries , the primary task is to eliminate poverty , improve education , health care , living conditions , enhance women 's status and strengthen environmental protection  
The Vice Premier noted that China and Nepal , as two developing nations , are economically complementary He hoped industrial and commercial circles of the two countries could work out more projects with less investment and quick results to benefit the peoples , and enhance a steady development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation  
Both developing countries , China and Peru are eager to further their economic and social development , Chen said , adding that the bilateral friendly cooperative relations will be advanced in the new century through joint efforts made by the two countries  
Jiang said that China and Chile , although far away geographically , are combined closely by the common goal of safeguarding world peace , defending national sovereignty , developing national economy and improving people 's living standard  
China values its traditional friendship with Namibia and is ready to work together to raise bilateral ties to a new level , Jiang told Nehova , and said that China is pleased with Namibia 's success in safeguarding its territorial integrity , strengthening national unity , and developing the economy after getting independence seven years ago  
Li said he hopes that Thuwainy 's visit will help expand bilateral friendly cooperation Since China and Oman established diplomatic relations nearly two decades ago , he said , their leaders have placed great importance on developing bilateral ties and have supported each other in international affairs  
He stressed that China attaches great importance to developing Sino U S commercial ties which have played an important role in bilateral relations and offer vast potential in wide ranging areas  
commenting on china 's role in this regard , yang said china proposed the idea of a new world order some two years ago and is willing to work together with tunisia and other developing countries in an effort to establish a fair and reasonable new international political and economic order which is conducive to peace and development  
On the external debt issue , she said as many developing countries are still faced with the difficulties caused by heavy external debt burdens , it is imperative that further measures aimed at a comprehensive , effective and durable solution of the problem should be explored  
qian noted that the two countries differ greatly in population and size but both , situated in asia pacific region , are developing countries and are confronted with the common task of safeguarding the regional peace , developing their own countries ' economies and raising people 's living standards  
Non governmental exchanges will help establish direct links between cultural groups of the two sides who have common interests However , he added , ethnic characteristics in various cultures must be preserved during the process of developing friendly relationship  
the premier admitted that some problems do exist in china 's current economic life , but said that chinese leaders have a good grasp of the situation and are confident of tackling the problems through various effective measures and developing its economy in a normal and healthy way  
Dominique Casier , FBA chairman and chief representative of the Beijing Office of the General Bank of Belgium , told the conference that foreign financial institutions are interested in Henan 's economic construction and in developing other central and western areas  
It said the authors of the report also need to address the unjust global economic system and financial monopolies which aggravate poverty in the developing countries and even provide incentives for corruption leading to massive transfers of assets to benefit the already rich societies  
Economic services rather than social services constitute the predominant functional category of developing countries ' expenditure , reflecting the overriding priority assigned to economic growth as a major policy goal .  
To meet the urgent need for increasing human capital and skills , developing countries have continued to allocate to educational services a higher proportion of central government expenditure than have industrial countries .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
With increasing diversity and rapidly changing patterns of international relations , adjustment and economic policy reform for sustained development in developing countries will be a more complex task in the decade ahead .  
We Colombians , for example , have in just a few years achieved significant political , economic and social changes aimed at developing a new democratic century that is more open , more participatory , more pluralistic , more decentralized and more just .  
The economic crises in the developing world have been greatly aggravated : unemployment and economic stagnation have been compounded by persisting problems in international trade , by foreign debt and by falling prices for raw materials .  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
As has been observed , ethnic tensions have become the racial fault line in widely diverse societies all over the globe - the advanced , the developing , the relatively stable and the unstable alike .  
However , it was observed that developing countries were facing exceptional difficulties in reaching compatible levels of technological development , without which effective and widespread regional science and technology cooperation could not occur .  
In the spirit of developing endogenous capacity , maximum possible use is being made of local consultants , local organizations and local mechanisms , within the overall local social , economic , cultural and political setting .  
The economic and social gap between rich and poor countries is growing wider by the day , and the economies of the developing countries , particularly the least developed among them , are prey to chronic recession .  
Indeed , the promise of global peace and security and the vision of a new world order are inhibited by political and ethnic conflicts , economic and social disorder , and deepening poverty , particularly in developing countries .  
More sustained and intensified international cooperation to provide logistical assistance to developing countries and practical measures against the laundering of drug money are fundamental to effective action to combat drug trafficking .  
For the developing countries , the primary concern is to achieve steady and sizeable rates of economic growth for a better standard of living for their growing population .  
" Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into at Rio was based on providing developing countries with substantial new and additional resources to meet their huge sustainabledevelopment requirements .  
Sustained and accelerated economic growth in developing countries would make for global ecological sustainability and should be central to development efforts at the national and international levels .  
Strikingly , foreign direct investment currently accounted for a larger share of gross domestic capital formation in developing countries than in developed countries .  
The existing constraints to increasing the environmentally sound energy supplies required for pursuing the path towards sustainable development , particularly in developing countries , need to be removed .  
It was also stressed that the computerization of criminal justice systems should be applied at the national and international levels , with due consideration given to the standards prevailing in both developed and developing countries .  
The same representative stressed the importance of emphasizing the repercussions on women of unilateral economic measures of a coercive nature which are , at times , applied against developing countries for political reasons .  
The study reviewed recent trends in women 's educational status in developing countries and updated existing evidence on the direct and indirect linkages between education and reproductive behaviour , marriage and desired family size .  
In developing the mineral sector and increasing its attractiveness to foreign investors , information regarding all laws , regulations , mineral potential , support services , the ability of the skilled workforce , and key government contacts is essential .  
They represent simple , effective , inexpensive and feasible technologies which can be used everywhere , even in the most inaccessible areas of developing countries , if the health workers are appropriately trained and supervised .  
Despite the rapid spread of contraceptive practice , unwanted births still constituted about one fourth of total fertility at the time of surveys conducted in the developing countries in the late 1980s .  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Several representatives stressed that developing countries , because of their backward scientific , technological , economic and social conditions , would have difficulty in meeting the onerous preventive obligations contemplated in the draft articles .  
The objective is to achieve a rapid and substantial reduction of maternal morbidity and mortality , reducing the differences observed between developing and developed countries , and to eliminate all deaths from unsafe abortion .  
In a growing number of countries , the private sector has or is fast developing the financial , managerial and technological capacity to carry out a vast array of such activities in an effective and costefficient manner .  
Moreover , at the international level , prospects for achieving adequate , predictable , new and additional financial flows to developing countries for sustainable development are fraught with many challenges .  
Fuller consideration must also be given to tapping the surplus rural female workforce within economic development , paying special attention to developing township enterprises that are suitable for women , while ensuring good and safe working conditions .  
Three additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1315 ) .  
It stressed the urgent need for the expansion of reproductive choice by developing new and improved methods of fertility regulation that were safe , effective and responsive to the needs and concerns of the users , including adolescents .  
Deeply preoccupied by the increasingly heavy burden being imposed , particularly upon developing countries with limited resources of their own and upon the international community as a whole , by these sudden mass exoduses and displacements of population ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
In most developing countries , the direct impact is virtually inconsequential in light of the large numbers of poor who , often rural and either unemployed or underemployed , have little if any prospect to work for a foreign affiliate .  
The MSI research demonstrated that promising entrepreneurs can be identified and trained , and based on the results of this research MSI developed a compact , costeffective , training programme for identifying and developing local sources of entrepreneurship .  
Deeply concerned about the continued increase of widespread poverty in a large number of developing countries and , in particular , about the fact that households headed by women represent a considerable proportion of households living in extreme poverty ,  
Four additional tables provide some basic indicators as well as current levels of total bilateral and multilateral official development assistance ( ODA ) to the small island developing States ( tables 1316 ) .  
Moreover , at the international level , there is no clear evidence as yet of the provision of adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in particular to developing countries , for sustainable development .  
Capacitybuilding , training , regional and international cooperation and information exchange along with a strong coordinating body at the national level seem to have been common primary requirements by developing countries .  
Nongovernmental agricultural research institutes supported by the global programme have developed and shared improved strains of rice , potatoes , fish and other foods vital to the nutritional needs of developing countries .  
An interim multilateral fund was created to assist developing countries meet their incremental costs ( mainly technical and financial ) resulting from the adoption of substitute technologies to help them comply with the Protocol 's phaseout provisions .  
As part of the effort to expand the production base for trade , island developing countries need to strengthen regional capabilities for the effective surveillance and monitoring of marine and coastal resources and activities in the exclusive economic zones .  
Indeed , sound management of rural and urban settlements can be the vehicle for overcoming many of the social , economic and environmental problems faced by all countries , industrialized and developing .  
During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .  
A dozen countries in Asia and Latin America , characterized by financial analysts as " emerging markets " , received most of the capital inflow , while the vast majority of developing countries have not been touched by the growth in net financial transfers .  
The globalization of industrial production is likely to proceed at rapid pace and innovative responses will be required to counter growing unemployment and associated social unrest in both industrial and developing countries .  
Despite a renewal in economic growth world wide , the number of people living in absolute poverty has increased in developing and developed regions alike .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into during the recent years was based on the provision to the developing countries of substantial , new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements .  
Therefore , a renewed international dialogue , particularly between developed and developing countries , should not be based on the rich versus the poor dichotomy but rather on a new partnership for development , in other words , on mutual interest .  
Most developing countries had implemented economic reforms on the advice of the developed countries and international financial institutions , but at great social and political cost .  
The probability of sustained current recovery in the industrial countries would be greatly enhanced if the international community could take credible actions to realize the tremendous growth potential of developing countries .  
At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
Official development assistance , so important for developing countries that were unable to attract private financial flows , continued to decline both in real terms and in proportion to the gross national product ( GNP ) of developing countries . 
While national Governments were primarily responsible for implementing Agenda 21 and other environmental instruments the developing countries lacked the financial resources and technology to do so without continued and enhanced international cooperation .  
Fourth , official development assistance , a major source of external financing for a majority of the lowincome developing countries , had declined in real terms and in relation to the gross national product of the developed countries .  
Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
Such cooperation was aimed at preserving the marine environment and living resources , disposing of toxic wastes , developing coastal infrastructure and taking joint action to promote sustainable development in border areas .  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m .  
In rich and poor countries , in industrialized and developing countries , criminals were engaged in diversified and widespread activities that violated the elementary rules of law .  
The international economic situation was such that the efforts made by the developing countries to develop longterm development strategies and lay down sound economic foundations were doomed to failure , thereby exacerbating political tensions .  
It was essential that the international community should recognize the decisive role it had to play in the creation of a favourable external economic environment and improving market access for products from the developing countries .  
An alarming trend was emerging whereby the developed countries were defending civil and political rights , whereas the advocacy of the right to development was being left exclusively to the developing countries .  
As the growing financial obligation which Member States must bear for peacekeeping operations was of vital importance , all countries , developed and developing alike , were encouraged to pay their contributions on time in accordance with their capacity .  
Noting further that the future course of the net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growthoriented supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
" Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
Noting that the future course of the net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growthoriented supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The first involved more efficient prevention , especially to address the problems of victims of internal conflicts , actual or potential victims of the situation in States that have recently emerged from authoritarian rule , and citizens of developing countries in flight from inhuman poverty or socio-economic instability .  
As the international community is aware , the Agreement signed at Chapultepec , Mexico , in January 1992 put an end to the armed conflict in El Salvador , marking the conclusion of the first phase of the peace process but the beginning of a complex and difficult period of transition during which the commitments made served as the framework for a developing political , economic and social process , which we are convinced will culminate in the consolidation of democracy . 
The development of the human and technical resources that are indispensable for the improvement of information and communication systems in developing countries and support for the continuation and strengthening of practical training programmes , such as those already operating under both public and private auspices throughout the developing world ;  
Recommends that actors at all levels , including non-governmental organizations , the private sector and , in particular , local and regional governments , be involved in the development and collection of indicators to meet local needs and monitor local conditions , and that national Governments maintain an enabling and coordinating role to permit the full utilization of local capacity in the process of developing , maintaining and using indicators as part of policy monitoring and evaluation ;  
The first is the international economy , transformed by global movements of trade , capital and labour ; driven by forces which can break developing economies ; regulated if they can be at all in forums outside the United Nations , which is therefore marginalized in this most momentous of contemporary developments . 
However , the fact that , in the new situation , the economic interests of the major Powers continued to have the upper hand frustrated the hopes of the developing countries that a new era of genuine solidarity between the rich and the poor was about to emerge and serve the legitimate interests of all the members of the international Community .  
We believe that the gap which exists , in the areas of economic growth and social advancement , between the wealthy industrialized countries , with their enormous economic resources , and the developing countries , is among the most chronic and significant problems that face the international community .  
The recent Conference of non-aligned countries held at Jakarta issued a renewed call for a new orientation between developed and developing countries whereby constructive dialogue and partnership were emphasized , based on a mutuality of interest and benefit , genuine interdependence and shared responsibility .  
What we have in mind is striking the necessary balance between the developed and the developing countries , by reinforcing the Council with a number of developing countries that are capable of shouldering such a responsibility and are capable of having the necessary impact at the regional and the international levels , in a manner that would make the Council more representative of international reality and , thereby , much more effective in dealing with international issues .  
There is a need , as a matter of priority that should be addressed with courage and creativity , to reformulate policies and solutions to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries that would help create a climate of equal opportunity amongst peoples and nations and make use of the latent potential of many parts of the world in paving the way towards balanced and comprehensive development at the threshold of the twenty-first century .  
In addition , it is necessary to deal with unjust practices in international economic relations such as coercive economic measures , including boycotts , the freezing of assets , the confiscation of property and the prohibition of the export of spare parts , which has been applied by certain developed countries against a number of developing countries , including my own .  
This remains a major preoccupation , as events since the end of the Cold War have demonstrated that civil conflicts and political instability in many countries , particularly in the developing world , have become endemic , with grave consequences for international peace and security . 
Most developing countries , especially the least developed , continue to be strangled by negative economic trends , stagnating resource flows , seemingly unstoppable reductions in export earnings , rising unemployment and , above all , the phenomenal increase in the number of people living in absolute poverty , occasioned largely by wars , famine , drought and the heavy burden of foreign debts .  
Nevertheless , we continue to hold the view that unless the debt issue is seriously addressed by the international community , no meaningful progress for the next 50 years can be accomplished in the foreseeable future by the developing countries , especially the least developed among them .  
The process should be orderly and informed by solid analytical work , with decisions based on rigorous evaluation of the mandates and performance of affected institutions and their relevance to the changing demands of developing countries .  
To the traditionally elusive development problems of persistent poverty , debilitating debt , declining levels of official development assistance , unemployment , demographic pressures and the worsening income gap and terms of trade between developed and developing countries , one must add the new and additional challenges of environmental degradation and globalization .  
During several specifically focused international conferences organized by the United Nations , an appeal has been made to the developed countries to fulfil their obligations to meet official development assistance targets and to help to create an international economic and political climate conducive to sustained economic growth in developing countries .  
We have clearly stated , on previous occasions , that the deteriorating economies of the developing countries and the widening gap between the rich and poor countries are the two principal causes of the proliferation of hotbeds of tension and bloody wars that , more often than not , wipe out every economic achievement , plunge the peoples of developing countries into cruel suffering and deprive them of the right to lead a decent life of security , stability , and development towards a better future . 
The United Nations is to be credited with impressive accomplishments in strengthening international peace and security , marshalling the efforts of the international community to put an end to colonialism and apartheid , ensuring the independence and sovereignty of developing countries and supporting their socio-economic development , advocating human rights and fundamental freedoms and protecting and preserving the environment , as well as in promoting education , culture , science and health .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
The pious promises of the developed world to allocate a minuscule percentage of national income to the provision of aid for the developing world have shrunk to non-fulfilment ; the thought of the strong economies helping the weak has shrivelled like a raisin in the sun .  
The Republic of China 's standing as the fifteenth largest trading nation in the world , with the twentieth highest gross national product and the largest foreign-exchange holdings , its continuing assistance to many developing countries and its efforts to strengthen international economic cooperation are obvious and can not be ignored by the world 's highest forum .  
Moreover , while the threat of a major international confrontation has receded with the end of the cold war , a host of other problems , including an upsurge in inter-State conflicts , international terrorism , growing poverty and marginalization of vast segments of humanity in the developing countries as well as within affluent societies , are coming to the fore .  
Let us learn from our successes , as from our failures , by developing preventive diplomacy at the regional level and by increasing the rapid response capability of our Organization in the humanitarian and military spheres .  
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
Youth represent 18 per cent of the world population , that is , 1.01-billion persons between 15 to 24 years of age ; 84 per cent of these people live in developing countries and represent a challenge within the context of the economic and social crisis that rages in Africa , as well as representing the enormous potential on which the future of our continent is based . 
We hope that the Agency will develop more projects that have a direct bearing on improving the quality of life of people in developing countries and that such model projects will provide an impetus to the growth of the peaceful uses of atomic energy .  
There is no doubt that the activities undertaken and the responsibilities shouldered by the Agency are worthy of our appreciation and respect in view of their positive returns with regard to the safety and security of the whole world , on the one hand , and , on the other , their contribution to social and economic development and other activities by facilitating the transfer of nuclear technologies for peaceful use in the developing countries .  
To this end , an institutional infrastructure was developed to promote economic and social development for our peoples through the establishment of a new international economic order , one that would generate more favourable conditions and opportunities for the developing countries to make progress , thus setting in motion a process of evening out the major imbalances between North and South . 
But continuing large disparities in wealth between rich and poor countries , the debilitating debt consuming us in the developing world , the unemployment , the persistent poverty , speak volumes as to the absence of sufficient progress on this front .  
In addition , at a time when the North-South gap continues to widen on a daily basis , the world economic trend , manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries , also tends further to debilitate the potential of the developing countries to deal with the adverse impacts of international economic development .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
The content of the statements made at the highest level during the debate at the Special Commemorative Meeting and the Declaration adopted on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations again demonstrated the need for the international community to give the economic and social development problems of developing countries the attention they deserve .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
It is equally important to realize that restructuring alone can not accomplish much in the area of socio-economic development without a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries , as called for in resolution 48 / 162 .  
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
The issue has acquired added importance over the past few years due to the fact that the illegal transfer of ownership of cultural property , in particular of archaeological artifacts , has increased dramatically as a result of the unfavourable economic situation in developing countries , and the fall in the exchange rate of the national currencies of those countries against those of a small group of developed , industrialized countries .  
They now face the challenging tasks of reviving and modernizing national institutions , designing and developing both the human and the physical infrastructures , and rebuilding the economy by revitalizing agriculture , industry and trade and social services all with extremely limited resources and formidable impediments . 
While some developing African countries and regions have undoubtedly benefited from the economic take-off of the last decade and applied positive structural adjustment policies , the results of Africa 's socio-economic development during this last period in particular in sub-Saharan Africa , where a large number of the least developed countries are concentrated have been universally acknowledged as disappointing .  
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
Given much-needed support to the developing countries as they reactivate their economies and creating a favourable external environment for them are not only important conditions for the shared economic growth and common prosperity of all countries , but also a crucial guarantee for lasting peace and stability throughout the world .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
The reciprocal commitment by developed and developing countries to allocate an average we would say a minimum of 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets , respectively , to basic social programmes has yet to be fulfilled .  
In this context , let me thank the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , headed by Mr . Jean-Claude Milleron , which is responsible for generating and producing economic , demographic , social and environmental information and for analyzing national and regional development policies and trends .  It also provides technical assistance to developing countries for their projects in the areas of statistics and population .  
In pursuit of that objective we have contributed to the exchange of information and expertise in the various areas of development ; we have opened our markets to free international trade ; we have established the Abu Dhabi development fund to make concessional loans to developing countries ; and we have participated in the provision of assistance through regional and international bilateral and multilateral development institutions .  
The implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action will require mobilization of new and additional financial resources at the national and international levels , better and effective utilization of the existing resources , enhanced assistance from the developing countries and a substantial reduction in their debt burden .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
One of the most concrete outcomes of Copenhagen was the adoption on a voluntary basis of the 20 / 20 principle , which calls for interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
We have accumulated considerable scientific , technological and industrial potential in developing detection and de-mining equipment which allows us to take part in international programmes for the development and manufacture of promising equipment and technologies in this field .  
As members know , the working papers prepared by the Secretariat inform us that the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories are developing successfully and thus moving towards self-determination only where there has been the active involvement of foreign economic entities through substantial foreign investment .  
The figures speak for themselves : some 1-billion people live below the subsistence level ; half of the world 's population may not have access to safe drinking water ; three quarters of the developing world do not have adequate sanitary facilities ; while at least 200-million people lack basic shelter .  
In the preambular paragraphs , the General Assembly would note with satisfaction that the programme has trained an appreciable number of public officials selected from all geographical regions represented in the United Nations system and also that many officials of developing countries have acquired expertise through the training programme .  
These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at providing the United Nations system , on a stand-by basis , with specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation , and , in this regard , notes with satisfaction the establishment , in particular in developing countries , of national volunteer corps ;  
Given the very low levels of per capita energy consumption in rural households in the developing countries at present , the absolute rise in residential energy consumption needs to be very rapid simply to satisfy basic human needs .  
The potential contribution of improved efficiency in meeting growing needs for energy services in a sustainable way in the rural areas of developing countries can be substantial , especially at the point of end use , by introducing new , efficient , low-polluting technologies and systems and by upgrading existing , inefficient systems .  
Many representatives considered that it was essential to look into the special needs of developing countries and the extra funding needed for implementing measures if the critical areas of concern identified in the Platform for Action were to be addressed effectively .  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
To identify and strengthen or develop , as required , in particular in developing countries , the appropriate institutional , legal and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policy and its implementation are a catalyst for sustainable social progress and economic growth .  
Governments , according to their capacities and available resources and with the cooperation of the United Nations and other relevant organizations , should promote centres of excellence for training in hazardous waste management , building on appropriate national institutions and encouraging international cooperation , inter alia , through institutional links between developed and developing countries .  
To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
This would encompass the preparation of national strategies and actions for meeting basic learning needs , universalizing access and promoting equity , broadening the means and scope of education , developing a supporting policy context , mobilizing resources and strengthening international cooperation to redress existing economic , social and gender disparities which interfere with these aims .  
National and local educational authorities and relevant United Nations agencies should expand , as appropriate , the use of audio-visual methods , especially in rural areas in mobile units , by producing television and radio programmes for developing countries , involving local participation , employing interactive multimedia methods and integrating advanced methods with folk media ;  
Furthermore , it had been decided that an executive session of the Board would be held at the earliest possible opportunity to address the modalities for dealing with the implications for trading opportunities of developing countries and countries in transition concerned of new and emerging issues on the international trade agenda . 
UNCTAD , when carrying out technical cooperation , should exploit its comparative advantages , ensure complementarity with the related work of other international organizations , intervene on strategic and catalytic grounds and allow for the differentiated needs of developing countries with a particular focus on the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , in accordance with the Cartegena Commitment .  
In August 1993 , IMF wrote to ministers of finance , central bank governors and heads of national statistical offices in a number of industrial and developing countries to seek their comments on the terms of reference of the Task Force ; on the role of international organizations in developing standards for finance statistics ; on current arrangements for data collection and sharing ; and on the findings of the questionnaire .  
The Task Force has reviewed current arrangements for the reporting and sharing of finance statistics by international organizations , and notes that there appears to be a considerable and probably increasing degree of data sharing of finance statistics among international organizations , especially through the use of electronic media , which have replaced the use of report forms in the industrial and major developing countries .  
The Committee has noted that coordination needs to be improved among international organizations involved in developing balance-of-payments capital account stock data ( partly as an aid to estimating detailed geographic flows ) as well as detailed service statistics and other closely related areas of statistics , such as direct and portfolio investment statistics .  
The procedure includes a series of visits by IMF staff to the main international organizations concerned and to official agencies in a number of selected industrial and developing countries , as well as the distribution of an annotated outline of the manual to all member countries for comment .  
An earlier report of the Secretary-General ( A / 45 / 274-E / 1990 / 73 and Corr . 1 ) , submitted to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session through the Economic and Social Council , had stressed the need to adopt comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures in order to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , including new and renewable sources of energy .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 , that of migrants in the developing countries increased nearly sixfold , rising from 0.4 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.2 per cent during 1975-1985 .  
The debate on the issues raised within the Agenda for Peace evoked , and in fact continues to evoke , mixed reactions within and outside the United Nations , developing into a continuing debate as the issues raised deal with questions of international peace and security , with substantial focus on the United Nations peacekeeping activities .  
This calls for the strengthening of preventive diplomacy , including developing adequate early warning capacities , dispatching field missions , and utilizing the good offices of Governments , international or regional organizations or eminent personalities in order to get to the source of an imminent conflict and safeguard the security , well-being and human rights of the affected civilian population .  
Priorities have to be assigned , using the Programme of Action as a guide , among potential topics - for example , certain aspects of human sexuality , sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS , preparation for family life , promoting the status of women , developing among girls a positive and future-oriented self-image , the dynamics and implications of rapid urbanization , male responsibility and so forth .  
A projection of collective and global resource requirements , presented by the organizations to their respective governing body , based on approved and planned programmes , taking into account the needs of developing countries , their absorptive capacity , the themes and programmes of action agreed at world conferences and other forums , and the ability of the organization to deliver the proposed programmes ;  
Either of these modalities , together with strong political support for operational activities , could provide a better system with more assured , predictable and increased levels of resources to meet the needs of developing countries .  
Welcoming the increased role undertaken by the United Nations system to support activities in economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and stressing the importance of continuing to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations to foster international cooperation in order to address fully the wide range of issues pertaining to development and the growth of developing countries ,  
Many of those weapons are being bought , from developed countries , by developing countries that can least afford to dissipate their precious and finite assets for such purposes , and the volume of the trade in light weapons is far more alarming than the monetary cost might lead one to suspect . 
We are now in the process of developing permanent mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and collective security based on a regional commitment to a system of shared democratic values .  
Globalization , which is a consequence of increased human mobility , enhanced communications , greatly increased trade and capital flows and technological developments , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy , particularly in developing countries . 
Note : The words in brackets and in bold are pending ; a proposed alternative was to retain only the words " developing countries " and to insert a new sentence : " Radical political , social and economic changes in the countries with economies in transition have been accompanied by a severe deterioration of their economic and social situation . "  
Protecting the [ traditional ] rights to land and other resources of pastoralists , fishery workers and nomadic and indigenous people and strengthening land management in areas of pastoral or nomadic activity , building on traditional communal practices , controlling encroachment by others , and developing improved systems of range management and access to water , markets , credit , animal production , veterinary services , health including health services , education and information ;  
Expanding basic education by developing special measures to provide schooling to children and youth living in sparsely populated and remote areas , for children and youth of nomadic , pastoral , migrant or indigenous parents , and for street children , children and youth working or looking after younger siblings and disabled or aged parents , and disabled children and youth ; establishing , in partnership with indigenous people , educational systems that will meet the unique needs of their cultures ;  
Supporting academic and research institutions particularly in the developing countries , in their contribution to social development programmes , and to facilitate the mechanisms for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of social progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about economic and social development ;  
Implementation of the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of the small-island developing States , in particular by providing effective means including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for social development programmes in accordance with the Barbados Declaration and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Programmes of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Inviting the international community , including the international financial institutions , to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development without falling into a new debt crisis ;  
United Nations development efforts should be supported by a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as stated in resolution 47 / 199 ;  
According to the Human Development Report 1994 , Chile had ranked eighth out of 97 developing countries in 1992 in the human development index , which took into account such indicators as infant mortality , daily caloric intake , adult literacy and average number of years of schooling .  
This migration is mainly a shift from rural to urban areas within developing countries , but also as continued high levels of migration flow between countries , and increasing interregional migration - particularly from developing countries with poor , fast growing populations , to developed countries .  
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
Call upon multilateral organizations and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to cooperate with Governments in developing a coordinating mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of existing conventions and agreements on biological diversity and the rational use of limited resources ;  
UNESCO is developing its own electronic network and information service on biosphere reserves and ecological sciences ( MABNet ) , as well as its own database on national and cultural world heritage sites .  29 .  WCMC continued to compile and update substantial databases on habitats and threatened animals and plants for the red data books and biodiversity status reports that it publishes .  
The support units seem widespread - they are responsible for developing local guidelines for national execution , training line ministries on national execution procedures , preparing the required national execution reports , facilitating contractual arrangements with cooperating and implementation agencies and generally providing support to the technical ministries hosting nationally executed programmes .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
Establish a group of eminent persons selected through a consultative process and balanced between developed and developing countries , as well as equitably representing all interest groups and the forest products trade , with a mandate to chart a path towards steady progress in international trade in forest products from all types of forests based on sustainably managed forests and the application of criteria and indicators to measure and monitor such management . 
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
Russia was prepared to seek mutually acceptable decisions with regard to security guarantees for the non-nuclear States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , which would create favourable conditions for the development of broad international cooperation in the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes , taking duly into account the needs of the developing countries .  
The Committee recommends that the State party strengthen the coordination between the different governmental mechanisms involved in human rights and children 's rights , at both the national and local levels , and ensure a closer cooperation with non-governmental organizations , with a view to developing a comprehensive policy on children and ensuring an effective evaluation of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the country .  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , and especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with the needs of their economic development ,  
Thus , it was stated that the establishment of an international criminal court , with the subsidiary organs mentioned in article 5 and other infrastructures , would entail an enormous financial outlay which might be an extra burden for developing countries .  
The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly the developing countries ,  
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
At the global level , a significant number of the inhabitants of our planet continue to be chronically poor ; nearly 35 per cent of the adult population are still illiterate , two thirds of whom are women ; 30 per cent of school age children do not complete primary school ; over 40 per cent in the developing countries are without basic services .  
Stressing the importance of trade as a major instrument of economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries and the need to find solutions to microeconomic issues of international trade which can significantly contribute to more open , dynamic and efficient trade relations ,  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
For those States that carried a large burden of foreign debt , structural adjustment programmes forced cuts in basic services and in investments in human development , shifting the responsibilities of basic social services from Governments to women without compensation .  In some developing nations , especially in Africa , the situation was further aggravated by a decline in commodity prices .  
Recognizing the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , including , inter alia , developing basic infrastructural facilities , promoting social development , combating socio-economic disparities and poverty , preparing , as appropriate , conditions for the private sector and protecting the environment ,  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
In synthesis , the fifth country programme aims at developing , piloting and building within six local impact areas , capacities and systems for a participatory approach to development that will enable the poor to benefit from basic social services , resources and advice necessary for the enhancement of their productivity and improvement of their standard of living .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
The new forces of modern science and technology , if harnessed properly and applied in accordance with each country 's particular socio-economic and cultural circumstances , offer immense possibilities for solving many of the complicated problems that are currently impeding economic , social and environmentally sound and sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
A problem shared by developing and industrialized countries alike is that most current training programmes and institutional structures are sectoral and disciplinary and do not address the complex interactions among people , natural resources , technology , environment and development .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
Recognizing the high costs of research in biotechnology , several existing agricultural research institutes have strengthened or initiated new biotechnology programmes to address the common elements of research and development as well as the training needs of developing countries in many areas outlined under programme area E , with support from financial institutions , foundations and , to a lesser extent , the private business sector .  
The economic returns resulting from those biotechnology applications that have been supported by venture capital have encouraged a steady increase in investment in biotechnology , yet the beneficial results of applications in developing countries and the benefits derived from such applications are not perceived to have extended much beyond the business community .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .  
Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights , and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa , Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean ,  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
By its decision 16 / 25 of 31 May 1991 , the Governing Council set the following long-term goals for the work of ELI / PAC : ( a ) a coherent body of international law in the environmental field ; ( b ) national environmental laws adopted and institutions established in developing countries ; and ( c ) an operational comprehensive database on national and international environmental law . 
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .  
Nevertheless , several countries state that in order to have a more sustainable impact , legal literacy should include developing an awareness of rights in general and of existing national statutory rights in particular , since penal and civil codes protect everyone .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
This was accompanied by a dramatic fourfold increase in developing countries and substantial increase in the former centrally planned economies ( by a factor of 2.4 ) .  7 / In per capita terms , the absolute consumption of fossil fuels in developed countries outstripped by a factor of 9 the consumption level in developing countries , as is evident in table 3 .  
Despite encouraging progress achieved over the past two decades in energy efficiency , especially in industrialized countries , global demand for commercial energy is projected to continue to grow in the coming years , with the main momentum coming from developing countries .  
Environmental monitoring data and other relevant information , including consumer information , which are currently lacking in many developing countries , need to be developed urgently so as to provide a sound information base for policy formulation and decision-making on changing the current unsustainable production and consumption patterns .  
In the rural areas , where they are predominantly located in most of the developing regions except Latin America , they are the landless or near-landless illiterate agricultural workers , nomads , fishermen , pastoralists and forest dwellers who eke out a subsistence income from seasonal agricultural employment or from marginal lands and forests or from low-income non-farm work .  
For the rural poor who constitute the bulk of the poor in developing countries and who are unskilled and illiterate , the most effective approach to providing them with productive assets is agrarian reform - redistribution of land and reform of tenancy laws . 
It is generally recognized that the capacity of agriculture to absorb the growing labour force on a long-term basis is limited in most of the developing countries with a high incidence of rural poverty by the sheer unavailability of additional arable land . 
The latter 's objective is to enable people with low incomes in the Appalachian region successfully to enter the economic mainstream by , inter alia , organizing cooperative ventures among small firms to produce for niche markets , mobilizing financial resources on behalf of the region from outside , creating learning clusters in conjunction with other communities in the country , providing transitional support for people moving from welfare to work , and developing production and leadership skills .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
According to the World Industry Council for the Environment ( WICE ) , 39 / inbound foreign capital only accounts for some 3-4 per cent of total domestic capital formation in developing countries , the vast majority coming from domestic savings .  
In fact , some experts worry that FDI serves to transfer fewer environmentally sound technologies to developing countries as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  In recent years , however , these fears have become less justifiable for several reasons .  
The United Nations needed to be more competitive in the international professional market and the current salary package fell particularly short in respect of nationals from both developed and developing countries who had other options for employment .  
The consensus 9 / adopted by the Conference views environmental degradation as having many causes , including irrational development patterns , inappropriate technologies and consumption patterns , mainly among industrialized countries and privileged minorities in developing countries , and worsening standards of living for vast sectors of the population .  
For clusters of indicators , various organizations will have the task of assuming a leading role in a transparent consultative process for the purpose of further developing the indicators , as relevant , including the underlying methodology , and of analysing the data availability for each indicator in order to provide a full description of each indicator in a set of methodology sheets .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
Despite the cyclical fall in contributions to multilateral institutions , developing countries ' receipts from this source were cushioned to some extent by the fact that the multilateral institutions , especially the international financial institutions , can draw on income from previous years to make their current disbursements .  
To support private pollution abatement investment , Governments in OECD countries , economies in transition and developing countries have used a wide range of policy instruments , which may be divided into three main categories : directed credit programmes , financial incentives , co-financing arrangements and venture capital funds .  
In fact , many experts worry that foreign direct investment serves to transfer environmentally inferior technologies to developing countries , as companies in more heavily regulated developed countries seek either to sell-off outmoded capital equipment and / or to shift production to jurisdictions with lower environmental standards .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
Many representatives considered that it was essential to look into the special needs of developing countries and the extra funding needed for implementing measures if the critical areas of concern identified in the Platform for Action were to be addressed effectively .  
While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .  
They note that an informal round table that includes representatives of all agencies , as well as members of the academic community and relevant non-governmental organizations , is useful for the purposes of developing innovative ideas and concepts relating to how development communication should be understood , as far as this concept has not yet been defined according to one universal standard .  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and that they are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  See E / CN . 17 / 1994 / CRP . 2 .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
The broad mandate outlined in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action has sometimes tended to be measured in terms of the number of experts from developing countries working on projects , the frequency of meetings to promote TCDC and the level of procurement from the developing countries , instead of being seen as a rational imperative for ensuring the full integration of TCDC into the wider conception of operational activities in support of the overall development process .  
In particular , the more economically advanced developing countries are in a position to transfer to other developing countries the skills and experience , including new and innovative techniques of industrial organization and production and the creative application of technology , that have proved so successful in increasing the productivity and competitiveness of their own economies .  
Based on the fundamental and inexorable shifts that have occurred in the dynamics of global development cooperation , it is important to reorient TCDC in terms of its substantive policy and operational thrust in order to ensure that it continues to serve as a dynamic technical cooperation instrument at the disposal of the developing countries and the international community as a whole .  
TACF provides assistance and training to developing countries in the use of nuclear technology for power generation , and for scientific , resource , agricultural , medical , environmental and industrial applications , as well as for activities relating to radiation protection , safety of nuclear installations and waste management .  
Although progress towards universal education and literacy has been impressive in recent times , the number of illiterate people will continue to grow and many developing countries are likely to fall short of universal primary education by the year 2000 .  Three main concerns regarding current systems of education may be expressed .  
Efforts should be made to remove those unreasonable restrictions on transfer of nuclear energy technology so as to help the developing countries master the technology for peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to create favourable conditions for the establishment of a new international cooperative relationship in the field of nuclear energy .  
This concludes that the TCDC concept remains valid and is likely to assume increased importance in the future in light of the changes occurring in the international system and their impact on the traditional structure of multilateral technical cooperation , creating increased opportunities for TCDC , based among other things on the increasing differentiation among developing countries .  
In response , the Special Unit has prepared a report which contains a number of recommendations designed to promote and implement a more strategic approach to technical cooperation among developing countries in an effort to make it a dynamic instrument in support of development in the context of the changing realities of multilateral development cooperation .  
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
As Chief of the Section the incumbent would be responsible for developing comprehensive country-based and regional humanitarian strategies , ensuring proper measures are taken for effective coordination of all aspects of humanitarian assistance programmes in those regions , including support on the ground , fund-raising initiatives and consolidated inter-agency appeals .  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
A second programme : " Applications of biotechnology for development " is presently a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life . 
The additional post of Economic Affairs Officer requested will be the focal point essential to mobilize the existing expertise and research capabilities required to guide developing countries and least developed countries and strengthen their understanding of these matters and the competitiveness of their enterprises in increasingly globalized world markets and marketing requirements .  
The objectives and activities of the subprogramme during the biennium are designed to help developing countries and countries in transition to improve their product and market development efforts at the enterprise level and to strengthen the competitive position of their exports of traditional and non-traditional products and commodities , including technologically advanced and value-added products and services , in particular technical consultancy services on promising foreign markets .  
The increase of $ 31,600 is required for the broader scope of information to be covered , such as new market potentials for products from developing countries , emerging new trading areas in Central and Eastern Europe and the Pacific Rim , environmental aspects of international trade , women in development ; increased prices and shipping costs and the high prices of machine-readable data increasingly replacing traditional publications on the information market .  ( a ) Services in support of :  
Within the framework of existing guidelines , individual technical cooperation activities under the regular programme are determined by the nature of requests received from developing countries , the recommendations of intergovernmental legislative and expert bodies , and the approved work programmes .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
The programme comprises four interrelated and mutually supportive functions : ( a ) developing statistical concepts and methods for use by Member States ; ( b ) collecting , processing and disseminating integrated statistics ; ( c ) promoting the coordination of international statistical activities ; and ( d ) supporting technical cooperation in statistics and statistical data processing , including informatics .  
The activities to be carried out in the biennium 1996-1997 under the three subprogrammes of programme 12 of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised ( A / 47 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , will emphasize assistance to developing countries in improving their development planning systems and policies in support of national development through provision of advisory services to Governments upon their request and substantive and operational support to technical cooperation projects .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
An innovative programme has been designed to assist indigenous peoples in developing their own strategies , based on traditional knowledge , for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and habitat preservation while yielding economic benefits for the support of local populations .  
Initially created to foster the economic empowerment of women in the developing world by improving their access to credit , productive resources , training and opportunities for income - generation , the Fund 's scope of work over the last two decades has expanded to include the promotion of women 's social and political empowerment .  
The Commission noted the importance of developing , among the organizations of the United Nations system , a common or compatible system of access to their respective databases , in order to share data fully , to streamline the collection and interpretation of data and to identify data gaps , for the purpose of providing more comprehensive and integrated data to decision makers at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Russian Federation remains faithful to the principles of equitable international cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy and providing assistance to developing countries and regions of the world in satisfying their wishes on the basis of non-discrimination , if they are legitimate and do not run counter to the Treaty .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The transfer of environmentally sound technology , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 , in accordance with chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , is highlighted by the Commission as having a particularly important role to play in realizing the goals of sustainable development .  
The Commission recognizes that in pursuing studies on economic instruments , innovative mechanisms and the " matrix approach " , full consideration should be given to the concerns of developing countries stated above , including the mobilization of resource flows , and to promoting national capacities and capabilities , taking into account the social , economic and distributional impacts of policy options and keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
In welcoming the inter-sessional work undertaken by Governments , the Commission reaffirms the need for additional substantial efforts and real progress by States , in particular the developed countries , in changing their unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and in assisting to redress the present imbalances between industrialized and developing nations .  
The Commission emphasizes that strengthened international cooperation in harmonizing criteria for the setting of voluntary product standards , with due regard to the specific environmental , social and economic conditions in developing producer / exporting countries , should take into account concerns about market access and the competitiveness of products and services .  
For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
The main areas of focus involve debt and resource flows ; commodities and diversification ; structural adjustment programmes and policy reforms ; sustained and sustainable development ; population ; environment and development ; regional cooperation and integration ; export performance ; and problems of the least developed , land-locked and island developing countries , as well as related technical cooperation activities .  External relations .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
Such an attempt would be at least partly speculative , but the attempt would be incomplete if it ignored some of the key factors that are bound to influence future international economic relations and , inevitably , the economic well-being of the peoples of developing countries .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
A coherent national policy would enhance the managerial capability on economic and technical cooperation among developing countries within government and could enable developing countries to take maximum advantage of their participation in cooperation activities and speed up the implementation of relevant decisions and programmes .  
At the South-South level , cooperation could cover a broad area , or it could be limited to more extensive use of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality through which developing countries or regions with greater experience and knowledge in foreign direct investment matters could assist other developing countries in a variety of ways , including the provision of training . 
It also suggests an approach that consists of a careful selection of specific activities within the sector , followed by interactions among developing countries on the conceptual plane in the first instance , moving on to detailed technical work involving programme / project preparation , analysis and implementation .  
The harmonization of the viewpoints of developing countries at the conceptual level on specific issues pertaining to international economic cooperation ; these would include not merely issues at the macro level , but also at the sectoral level involving meetings of experts from developing countries , and more especially practitioners in the disciplines concerned from both the public and the private sector ;  
Examination and recommendation to developing countries on a continuing basis , in the light of changing circumstances and emerging conditions of specific areas and capacities relating to economic cooperation among developing countries and to technical cooperation among developing countries for absorbing lessons from the success of other developing countries .  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
The national committees for the Decade and related technical agencies of the industrialized countries have remained active in the respective countries and have pursued a variety of collaborative relationships with neighbouring countries , and supported disaster-reduction initiatives in developing countries .  
The objective of the Decade remains , as originally stated , " to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters " .  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
The wealth of knowledge of social and economic priorities and expanded networks of relationships with politicians and technicians in the respective regions offer an impressive potential for leadership in the United Nations system , as well as for developing networks and partnerships for selecting development priorities and designing programmes and projects .  
While welcoming the decision of JCGP to set a target date for this exercise , the General Assembly in resolution 47 / 199 emphasized that that process should be achieved in cooperation with host Governments in a way that increased efficiency , such as by means of the consolidation of administrative infrastructures of the organizations concerned , and with no financial increase in the cost of operations either to the United Nations system or the host developing country .  
Several delegations considered that UNEP 's regional offices could play a useful role in helping developing countries to strengthen their capacity to implement Agenda 21 .  5 / Some delegations stressed that the role of UNEP in providing information on sustainable development should be concentrated on environmental aspects of such development and that such information should be prepared upon the request of Governments .  
In many developing countries there is an apparent lack of a " critical mass " of qualified managers , technicians , and skilled workers needed to support basic levels of public sector activity .  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
UNDP had encouraged resident coordinators to strengthen and establish thematic working groups on HIV and AIDS and to ensure their effective functioning ; invited JCP / UNAIDS and its co-sponsors to attend UNDP training workshops ; participated actively in global - and regional-level activities to develop a strategic plan of action for JCP / UNAIDS ; and was working with staff of JCP / UNAIDS responsible for developing the programme 's approach at country level .  
" Despite all our technological breakthroughs , we still live in a world where a fifth of the developing world 's population goes hungry every night , a quarter lacks access to even a basic necessity like safe drinking water , and a third lives in a state of abject poverty - at such a margin of human existence that words simply fail to describe it .  
In modern management , it has been clearly demonstrated that private and public organizations that achieve excellence do not do so through a detailed , formal restructuring but , rather , inter alia , by developing the capacity to identify an agenda of key decisions , networking , involving staff , making innovations , enhancing flexibility , implementing efficient image-creation policies , improving relations with the media and developing leadership aptitudes to cope with complexity .  
In this context of social , economic , and political change , the United Nations is re-examining the relationship between public administration and development in order to fashion more effective and efficient means of delivering technical assistance to developing countries in the service of world peace .  
Secondly , the Indian Administrative Service ( IAS ) has established a professional corps of educated public administrators who share a common background of professional training , accept a common set of responsibilities towards developing the capacities of the citizenry in their jurisdictions , and represent a strong presence of the national Government in state and local jurisdictions .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
International economic , trade and development cooperation : As the world 's fourteenth largest trading nation and the sixth largest outbound investor , the Republic of China on Taiwan is willing to share its own development experience and achievements with the international community and has already offered to developing countries financial and technical assistance for development projects .  
In developing the standards in appendix II , five principles were followed : ( a ) performance statements were made functional and not equipment-specific ; ( b ) fairness was achieved by establishing a high but equitable level of performance ; ( c ) a firm baseline for a minimum acceptable level of performance was set ; ( d ) the standards must themselves be verifiable in the mission area ; and ( e ) the standards must be at a level and expressed in terms that are acceptable to all Member States .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
If the development of the legal framework of public administration is considered as progress for developing countries , just as for other countries , for the reasons stated above , three different resources can be mobilized : the legacy of foreign models subject to an appraisal with regard to present conditions and policy goals ; the national culture and legal tradition ( also subject to appraisal ) ; and universal values expressed in documents issued by the United Nations .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
The main development objectives of UNDP 's third country programme for Tokelau ( 1992-1996 ) focused primarily on developing a national identity and assumption of a greater degree of self-government ; improvement of living standards on the atolls ; ensuring the equitable distribution of resources ; and encouraging the active participation of the people in the development policy process .  
One delegation offered three principles to expand net income from the private sector in developing countries : the income generated should be additional to the general resources country programme allocation ; the strategic importance of the decentralized operations of the regional support centres in Rio de Janeiro and Singapore should be maintained ; and there should continue to be investments from FDP .  
The Director of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , UNDP , said that in the light of the processes of globalization and economic liberalization , the intensification of South-South cooperation has become a major imperative both as a development strategy and as a means for ensuring the effective and equitable integration of the developing countries in the new global order .  
Aside from the phenomenon of globalization , other approaches which could be explored included more innovative forms of cooperation among developing countries , taking into account their respective development experiences ; the growing trend of both developing and developed countries towards greater regional economic cooperation and integration and the steady growth in inter-developing country trade which has been rising steadily since the mid-1980s .  
In the meantime , in order to address the urgent problems facing the repatriation of refugees , it may be useful to convene , at the earliest possible date , a regional meeting aimed at developing concrete measures to implement the commitments embodied in the Nairobi Summit declaration of January 1995 , the Bujumbura Action Plan of February 1995 and the tripartite agreements signed by UNHCR , Rwanda and neighbouring countries hosting Rwandan refugees .  
The Director of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , UNDP , said that in the light of the processes of globalization and economic liberalization , the intensification of South-South cooperation has become a major imperative both as a development strategy and as a means for ensuring the effective and equitable integration of the developing countries in the new global order .

Encourage national implementation of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management and study the feasibility of further developing internationally agreed upon criteria and indicators against which progress towards sustainable forest management of all types of forests could be measured , taking into account the specific regional and subregional conditions of forests and the diversity of economic , social and cultural environments .  
Thus , the data and information management component of the Division of Environment Assessment is operating a computerized catalogue ( " meta-database " ) on environmental data and information , developing critical datasets for assessments and assisting and supporting national Governments , regional data networks and other programmes in their efforts to improve access to and management of relevant and meaningful data and information on the environment .  
The Consultative Committee also published the outcome and proceedings of the special meeting on developing legal and institutional guidelines for privatization and post-privatization regulatory framework , held at Tokyo in January 1994 , which included the draft text of such guidelines .  
The meeting reviewed the global observances of the Year and their implications for national social policies in the process of sustainable development ; considered concepts and forms of international cooperation on family issues , with particular emphasis on assistance to developing countries ; and identified strategies and recommendations regarding national , regional and international follow-up to the Year .  
We are fully cognizant of the fact that the shared historical and cultural heritage of the States , countries and territories of our Association provides a solid basis for developing our efforts at cooperation and concerted action , particularly in the areas of tourism , trade and transportation , as well as for enriching our future to the benefit of all our peoples ;  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
The United Nations system continues to play an important role in many traditional areas of operational activities in several countries : nearly all developing countries cited technical and technological assistance , social development , poverty alleviation , health and education , and the improvement of human resources as continuing priorities for the United Nations system .  
ensure that such measures are based on the best scientific evidence available and are designed to maintain or restore stocks at levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield , as qualified by relevant environmental and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing States , and taking into account fishing patterns , the interdependence of stocks and any generally recommended international minimum standards , whether subregional , regional or global ;  
Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
Parallel to subregional and regional cooperation efforts , at the global level the developing countries perceived a need to devote resources and efforts to developing better organization and coordination of the countries of the South to advance their common interests within multilateral negotiating forums , especially the United Nations . 
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
FAO regards South-South cooperation as a key element in the developing countries ' search for collective self-reliance and an essential contribution to the necessary structural changes required for a balanced and equitable process of world economic development .  
UNEP , however , has quite extensive programmes at the regional level , many of which would enhance the direct and mutual collaboration among developing countries or foster the generation of regional common positions on important political agenda issues .  
Most ECDC / TCDC promotional and supportive programmes / activities involve twinning of industrial research institutions ; identification and strengthening of centres of excellence in developing countries to provide industrial training and expert advice ; promotion of joint research and development programmes and linking of chambers of commerce and industry , industrial associations and other relevant institutions in various developing countries .  
It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
Also , in this regard , following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ( April 1994 ) , which included agriculture for the first time in a substantive fashion , there has been a growing interest by developing countries in coming to grips with the changed international trading environment for agriculture and FAO has been developing a programme to respond to this need .  
The work deals with comparative experiences in the privatization of water supply , focusing on private sector participation in urban water utility operations in industrialized , developing and transitional countries , an important area of intergovernmental policy discussions , including those relevant to Habitat II .  
The recent negotiations on a General Agreement on Trade in Services ( GATS ) have included provisions that would reduce barriers to the international movement of persons involved in the provision of the services .  22 / A growing number of skilled migrants are finding employment in developing countries whose economies are growing .  23 / In contrast , very few countries , whether developed or developing , are willing to admit substantial numbers of unskilled foreign workers .  
Capital has become more mobile than ever across the world , owing to a combination of policies that encourage foreign investment in many developing economies with the rapid advance in computer-based telecommunication technology ; and the growth in the size of institutional investors ( mutual funds , pension funds , and so on ) .  
For most developing economies in Asia , success in maintaining their growth rates lies in continuing their high levels of domestic savings , in broadly based human capital development , in improving the competitiveness of domestic markets , in their openness to foreign capital and technology , and in improved macroeconomic management .  
Models of international trade and the experience of fast-growing developing countries also imply that in order for the transition economies of central and eastern Europe to achieve long-term growth rates significantly higher than those of the developed economies , which by now have become their major trading partners , continuous and rapid improvement will be needed in their exports . 
There is much potential for further sweeping changes and geographical shifts in the loci of production , as the developing countries adapt to technological advances , especially large countries with a latent export potential , and as the economies in transition begin to expand , especially those situated in proximity to major world markets .  
In the developing countries as a whole , the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 17 per cent in 1960 to 21 per cent in 1990 , and the share of agriculture fell from over 31 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent , but in the least developed countries , manufacturing is still less than 10 per cent of their GDP and consists largely of food processing and natural fibre textile industries , which can not expand vigorously without a strong agricultural sector .  
However , in an increasing number of developing countries , with the accumulation of physical and human capital , technology and management know-how , the domestic base for more sophisticated services is being developed . 
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Strengthening national capacities in developing countries to implement the Platform for Action will require striving for the fulfilment of the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for overall official development assistance as soon as possible , as well as increasing the share of funding for activities designed to implement the Platform for Action .  
To facilitate implementation of the Platform for Action , interested developed and developing country partners , agreeing on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes should take into account a gender perspective .  
With the increased importance of NGOs in the United Nations system , this constituency and the scholarly community have a major role to play in channelling relevant information and research results , developing teaching materials , engaging in advocacy and sponsoring fruitful technical assistance activities , as the correctional training initiatives have recently demonstrated .  
It requested States and relevant international organizations to coordinate their law enforcement activities and otherwise cooperate to pursue those engaged in the smuggling and transport of such human cargo ; to provide technical assistance to countries in developing and implementing policies to prevent and criminalize clandestine traffic in illegal migrants , and to punish its organizers , enhancing the professional skills of the personnel concerned .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
The Panel stressed that all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings and expert consultations in support of the work of the Panel should ensure the transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives as well as a balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
One of the major objectives of international cooperation must be to create greater harmonization in criminal justice systems , by improving the standards of countries with weaker criminal justice systems in general or by developing national legislation specifically directed against organized crime .  
In most developing countries and countries in transition , however , various factors , ranging from lack of adequate resources to recent rapid political and economic developments and changes , have slowed down or inhibited the process of attaining a thorough understanding of the situation .  
The accumulation of theoretical knowledge has irreplaceable value for the purposes of educating younger generations and the public in general and for devising strategies and developing measures to counter the corrupting effects of organized crime on societal values .  
In the absence of specialized theoretical and practical knowledge , and in view of the difficulties faced in obtaining such knowledge , as well as the results of the experience accumulated in other countries , the elaboration of strategies and their implementation through legislative and regulatory measures are daunting tasks for many countries , particularly developing countries and those with economies in transition .  
The Government of Cuba stressed that despite the end of the cold war , certain Powers , based on their predominant position in the world economy , have continued to use coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
The Government of Cuba is concerned that , despite relevant resolutions adopted in recent years by the General Assembly on the use of coercive economic measures against developing countries , which provide a clear mandate , the United Nations Secretariat has still not identified specific activities within the medium-term plan and programme budget for the proper implementation of those decisions .  
The Government of Iraq stresses that the coercive economic measures taken by some developed countries against developing countries constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law , the principles of human rights and the divine prescriptions of religious law .  
The use of unilateral coercive economic measures as a means of exercising political and economic pressure against developing countries constitutes a grave violation of the human rights of individuals , groups and people recognized in the Charter of the United Nations and in all international human rights instruments . 
The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has consistently rejected any unilateral promulgation and application of laws such as those referred to in resolution 49 / 9 because such measures are inconsistent with the general principles of international law and violate the provisions of Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations , in particular paragraph 2 on developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples .  
Pilot projects take into account the specific characteristics of small island developing States in relation to waste generation and disposal , fragile ecosystems , limited resource base , geographical isolation and scarce human resources .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Furthermore , with the assistance of the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) , a national transport policy framework has been drafted , which aims at developing a coordinated transport system , in a market-oriented approach , and a sound base for the various carriers to provide reliable , efficient and economic services to the people .  
It is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .

NULLIt is generally agreed among mainstream economists that outward orientation in economic development has been the single most important factor responsible for rapid economic development and the reduction of inequality in the first and second generations of the newly industrialized economies and the other developing economies that have opened their economies to trade in the past decade .  
Policies directed at raising the productivity of the agricultural sector or developing entrepreneurship do not achieve the desired results unless they take into account the fact that within a single household separate economic accounting units exist and the pattern of the exchange of labour and distribution of resources among them reflects the differences in the bargaining power of its members , which in turn depends on their entitlement .  
NULLIn contrast to more developed countries , where growth in agricultural production has been based on application of technology and increased size of productive units , food production in developing countries remains centred on smaller holdings managed by households that provide the bulk of the labour input required by the productive systems .  
The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
A related concern is that the foreign debt difficulties of developing countries - debt owed to both private and official creditors - have for the most part not yet been resolved in a durable manner more than a decade after the debt crisis burst onto the international political stage .  
The net transfer of resources - the difference between gross domestic investment and gross domestic saving - has not been more than plus or minus 1 per cent of the GDP of the developing countries since 1980 , a year of unusually high oil prices when oil exporters placed substantial surplus resources in other countries . 
NULLWhatever the level of domestic savings and however large or small the net transfer of foreign savings , there is legitimate concern to ensure that those savings are allocated to investment in developing countries in a manner that is efficient and desirable in the social , political and developmental senses .  
NULLAlthough the case of Mexico had several unique features , once the crisis began international securities investors suddenly reassessed their risks in all the emerging market economies : the contagious effect of the Mexican crisis left no developing country untouched in the short term . 
NULLFor most of the post-war era , it has been taken for granted that the domestic savings of developing countries need to be supplemented with foreign savings to boost investment adequately and that it is not practical to expect private international financing to do the job : some projects that are developmentally important are just not bankable or practical areas for direct foreign investment .  
Most recently , on the heels of the Mexican payments crisis and the contagion factor described above ( see paras . 40-43 ) , the Governments of the major creditor countries have sought to bolster international confidence in developing economies through a strengthened early-warning system based on enhanced surveillance of economic policies .  
Developed country representatives underlined their support for the process through contributions to the two funds : they are both considered important , since it is essential that the high quality of Secretariat work be maintained ; and necessary that developing countries , in particular least developed countries , be well represented at forthcoming sessions of the Committee .  
Issues addressed here are closely related to those being considered by the General Assembly at its current session with respect to international cooperation in the eradication of poverty in developing countries , the International Year for Poverty Eradication , the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development , the coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences and the comprehensive policy review of operational activities .  
NULLWhile it is true that a high rate of investment is not by itself sufficient to bring about sustained development , no developing country has achieved sustainable , vigorous economic development with low rates of investment .  
The Centre for Human Rights , in close cooperation with other bodies and organs of the United Nations , is available for developing activities aimed at facilitating the full participation of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities in all aspects of the political , economic , social , religious and cultural life of their societies and in the economic progress and development of their countries .  
In most developing countries , the process of technological capability-building might be hampered by , inter alia , declining rates of investment , misallocation of resources , external imbalances , lack of diverse and sophisticated skills , weak linkages between domestic research and development institutes and enterprises as well as unfavourable external factors .  
NULLIn the light of those findings , the Working Group , in its general conclusions , confirmed that efforts towards promoting technology transfer and technological capability-building in developing countries and countries in transition need to be coupled with market-based trade and investment policy and pricing systems , and with a stable macroeconomic environment for business activity conducive to overall economic growth and employment . 
Priorities included : ( a ) regaining access to civilian populations in areas controlled by factions ; ( b ) preparing a new appeal for humanitarian assistance requirements ; ( c ) meeting the emergency needs of newly displaced populations ; and ( d ) developing a cohesive and shared strategy to meet the needs of the greatest possible number of affected civilians .  
NULLThe current development of the World Hydrological Cycle Observing System by WMO , with the support of the World Bank and others , will help to coordinate bilateral and multilateral contributions at both international and regional levels to further the coordination and technical consistency of water resource systems in the developing countries within the Hydrology and Water Resources Programme .  
NULLThe UNEP programme dedicated to the Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at the Local Level ( APELL ) has been instrumental in translating the broad need for warnings into a process for developing awareness of potential technological hazards and providing effective community collaboration for responding to industrial accidents .  
NULLThe Panel recommended to all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings or expert consultations relevant to the work of the Panel to ensure the open-ended , transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives and the balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
" In addition to international developments related to the elaboration of the 1982 Convention , FAO continued to stress , in fisheries policy and technical advice provided to its developing members , that the implementation of conservation and management measures in exclusive economic zones would be unlikely to bring sustained long-term benefits in the absence of sound , reliable and cost-effective MCS systems . 
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
The event could also include an exposition of traditional and improved farmers ' instruments , artisanal products of rural communities from various parts of the developing world , a photo exhibit , stands for publications , a video show and a musical programme , while the African and international media would cover the event through national and satellite television networks .  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
NULLThe budget of UNDCP has two separate and complementary parts : the regular budget concerned with treaty implementation and legal affairs ; and the Fund budget supported by voluntary contributions and geared to assist developing countries in drug control .  
In practical terms , the campaign against racism and xenophobia must be carried out by developing educational programmes , punishing those responsible for such practices , opening up new opportunities for members of racial and ethnic minorities and ensuring , at all levels , respect for human dignity .  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
Promotes regional and subregional cooperation on modalities for addressing critical issues faced by disadvantaged groups in societies undergoing rapid change , with particular consideration to technical cooperation among developing countries through the organization of national and subregional training workshops and field study-cum-seminar programmes ;  
It assists in increasing the statistical capacity of developing countries in their efforts by improving the quality of demographic , social , economic and other statistics in a form suitable for retrieval and dissemination .  
Even in normal times , particularly in developing countries , the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes , and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution , water supplies , health-care services , waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world .  
During 1995 , the UNICEF Regional Office continued to work with the secretariat in developing analytical materials on major issues affecting southern African children , including human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) , and is exploring possible collaboration with the human resource development sector in the area of basic education .  
The Sustainable Dar es Salaam Project ( SDP ) supports the City Council in developing sustainable solutions to priority environmental issues such as solid waste , servicing urban land , air quality , surface water , coastal area resources , recreational and tourism resources and urban agricultural production .  
The profound socio-economic , scientific , technological and cultural changes which have taken place in the world over the past decade demand educational systems which are capable of developing the skills required in order to cope with these changes and which stimulate creativity and emphasize the new culture of innovation , as well as a clear vision of the future vis - - vis the challenges of the next millennium .  
Among the 15 requirements to achieve this objective is agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ( ibid . , para . 88 ( c ) ) .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
The legitimate world-wide concern for social development and environmental protection should not be allowed to degenerate into additional conditionalities imposed on developing countries from abroad .  
In order to secure global peace and prosperity , it was essential to close the widening gap between the developed and developing countries and to ensure that development was equitable and sustainable .  
Not only were developing countries affected , given the unfavourable economic international climate , but also industrialized countries , where immigrant communities were increasingly the target of xenophobic , racist and intolerant acts .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
There is clearly an inadequate level of implementation of existing conventions and of international rules , regulations and standards , as reflected in the insufficient adaptation of national legislation and procedures , the inefficiency of enforcement and the increasing gap between developed and developing countries in their capacity for implementation .  
However , the international community 's determination to confront the new menace of illicit trafficking in nuclear material , on which the Agency is now developing a valuable database , should not distract attention from the continuing need to maintain vigilance over the dumping of radioactive wastes and other highly toxic substances in the territories of developing countries .  
In parallel , UNIDO is preparing a manual for self-diagnosis of critical technological needs for sustained competitiveness at the plant level , the core of which could be applied to all developing countries .  
Of particular significance among these are the facilitation of technical and financial support for developing country parties , as required by the Convention and called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 195 , as well as the role played by the secretariat in coordinating the in-depth reviews of the national communications received from annex I parties .  
64 A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national , social and economic development programmes .  
Emphasizes the need to broaden appropriate cooperation among monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to encourage the establishment of preventive consultations between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Reaffirming its resolution 48 / 165 of 21 December 1993 on the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership and 48 / 166 of 21 December 1993 on an agenda for development , Reaffirming also the urgent need for a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is required to contribute to a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries ,  
Noting also with concern the urgent need to fully address the problem of the combined external debt stock of developing countries , bearing in mind the special and critical situation of the most indebted developing countries in Africa and the least developed countries ,  
Expressing its concern that , despite the determined efforts undertaken by developing countries in terms of implementing continuous economic reforms and structural adjustments , the burden of debt and debt service of these countries continues to be a major obstacle to their sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Recognizes that a comprehensive , effective , equitable and durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries will have a substantial impact on sustaining the strength of the global economy and will greatly contribute to efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
Instead of imposing sanctions on the developing countries to prevent them from acquiring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and for development , thereby compelling them to acquire cheap nuclear technology equipped with minimum safety features and thus maximizing the risk of accidents , the developed countries must provide the developing countries with state-of-the-art nuclear technology equipped with the highest safety standards .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
In that regard , the meeting focused primarily on policy and management issues involved in national , regional and international space programmes , and on how those issues related to the exploitation of space technology for sustainable development , taking into account the social and economic conditions of the developing countries concerned .  
6 Presentations delivered during the Symposium addressed the issue of how satellite remote sensing and satellite communications could provide accurate and timely information considered to be essential for policy formulation and effective decision-making in developing countries .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
integral part of international cooperation on concrete issues in the economic , environmental and social fields to support plans and priorities of developing countries in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
Stresses the necessity for the international community , especially the developed countries , to create a favourable international environment to reduce volatility in private capital flows to developing countries and to enhance their growth-promoting role through , inter alia , the expansion of productive capacities in developing countries , to support their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community to promote a supportive international economic environment by adopting favourable macroeconomic policies for promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development , so as to allow and sustain the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action by the developing countries ;  
The Commission noted that growing awareness of the UNCITRAL legal texts in many countries , in particular developing countries and newly independent States , had resulted in increased requests for training and technical assistance from individual Governments or regional organizations .  
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
The representative of the United States of America said that at the Conferences held at Rio de Janeiro , Vienna , Cairo , Copenhagen and Beijing , Member States had been developing a blueprint for economic , social and environmental action that recognized the important linkages among the various issues considered .  
An increase in official development assistance , improved market access for export products , more equitable terms of trade , encouragement of foreign investments and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on a concessional and preferential basis would greatly facilitate the efforts of the developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , to implement Agenda 21 .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
Its members were all developing countries ; the mandates of its legislative bodies called for the promotion of economic , social and cultural cooperation among Member States ; and its subsidiary organs , agencies , affiliated institutions and international universities were geared towards the sharing of capacities and strengthening of cooperation in different spheres of socio-economic activity .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
The Committee 's deliberations therefore had to take account of the fact that the Organization 's political mandate needed to be coupled with effective funding based on realistic considerations rather than short-term assessments that would further weaken emerging democracies or the struggling economies of developing countries .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
stressed the need for strengthened international cooperation which should be reflected in appropriate financial and technological resources to enable developing countries to implement their national plans .  
Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions should focus on the urban transport , communications and energy sectors , and particular attention should be devoted to environmental policies and programmes in the developing countries with a view to improving and developing sustainable transport and communications systems , bearing in mind the respective social , economic and environmental requirements of those countries .  
tendency to impose unrealistic standards and requirements on the industries and products of developing countries and to propose or adopt financial policies which were detrimental to those countries ' economic and social development , under the pretext of environmental protection , was therefore inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of environmental agreements , including the Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
While stressing the crucial importance of controlling greenhouse gases , he noted that setting reduction objectives without taking into account the possible negative economic impact on developing countries to which the Convention gave special attention could not be regarded as a comprehensive approach for the implementation of the Convention .  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
The report on international cooperation for the eradication of poverty in developing countries ( A / 50 / 396 ) was valuable overall and responded generally to resolution 48 / 184 of 21 December 1993 ; however it lacked details on specific actions undertaken by United Nations bodies with respect to the role and needs of women living in poverty or the actions taken to improve social services in deprived urban areas .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt servicing-problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , particularly in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;

the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

addition , being aware of the need for concerted efforts on the part of all States , Belarus was actively developing its bilateral and multilateral cooperation in the fight against crime and had already signed , or was preparing to sign , agreements on the subject with various countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and others in Eastern and Western Europe .  
demographic trends would be compounded by the economic crisis facing the developing countries : even if global wealth increased , the gap between rich and poor , between and within countries , was likely to widen further and foster social unrest , drug abuse and crime .  
the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
It was a matter of concern that some developed countries continued to impose unilateral protectionist measures and to create new types of protectionism , such as environmental labelling and social clauses , that would have an adverse impact on economic growth and development in the developing countries . 
WONG ( Australia ) expressed the hope that the outcome of the Uruguay Round , the most ambitious and comprehensive multilateral trade negotiations ever undertaken , would be translated into major net increases in world income , economic growth and employment both in developed and developing countries .  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
overwhelming majority of the world 's population lived in developing countries and for them , while political and civil rights were important , economic , social and cultural rights , particularly the right to subsistence and development , were paramount .  
was not mere rhetorical emphasis to say that the developing countries - regardless of their good will and sense of responsibility - faced a difficult choice between paying their debts to the Organization or attending to their own basic needs .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
Ever since its independence , Algeria 's principal aim has been the establishment of the institutions that make up a solid State , a State that endures beyond the realm of events and individuals , a State that has been given the weighty task of laying the groundwork for an economic and social machinery geared towards recovering and fully developing the nation 's wealth so as to meet the needs of its people .  
The imperatives of reducing budget deficits and the desire to achieve operational efficiency shared by us all could not possibly be the basis for a universal conclusion favouring the diminishment of the State or the systematic dismantling of public administration at the cost of inviting the disruption of networks that provide structure and sustenance to economic and social life in many developing countries .  
This requires effective political will and the support of a technical administration that is capable of developing its mechanisms and operational procedures in response to changes at the national and international levels .  
On the question of the funding of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , of particular importance to developing countries is , first , the new appeal for a substantial increase in resources for these activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and for intensified efforts to mobilize the political will to achieve this .  
The view was expressed that international cooperation in outer space activities should be further strengthened through the promotion of transparency , exchange of data , equitable sharing of space benefits and confidence-building measures between developed and developing countries .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
In the development debate , globalization and the call for integration into a single global economic grid are held out as the primary or even the sole option for developing countries seeking cooperation with developed countries .  
Honduras , like all other developing countries , is deeply committed to processes designed to combat poverty and underdevelopment and to mobilize the potential of its peoples and resources in order to attain speedy , fair and sustained growth , working jointly to enhance the effect of national efforts through solidarity , cooperation and mutual confidence .  
Like many other developing countries undergoing fundamental changes , Mongolia is faced with a host of problems : a low level of development , poverty , unemployment , an external debt burden and an underdeveloped national economic structure vulnerable to fluctuations on the world market . 
In this context , the Sultanate of Oman , as a developing country , has been looking forward to receiving the global support and assistance which , under the generalized system of preferences , the international community extends to developing countries to help them address the challenges posed by economic reforms and structural adjustment .  
The international community , which is still plagued by persistent violence , organized crime , drugs and terrorism , must translate these recommendations into a reality that will guarantee equitable economic and social development and the free flow of trade between the developed and the developing countries .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
Allocating of resources to support the development of developing countries and contributing in various ways to bilateral and multilateral international cooperation for development are wise investments for peace and for the shared future of all of our societies .  
If in the resolution of crisis and conflicts the participation of the majority of countries is somewhat limited or even indirect , through an intermediary mechanism , in the resolution of the global issues for development the United Nations has been able to mobilize the direct participation of all countries , big and small , rich and poor , developed and developing , because these are not just to whom it may concern issues .  
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
Aware that they are primarily responsible for promoting their own development through sound and consistent economic and social policies , the developing countries involved in structural adjustment programmes have made enormous sacrifices , which , unfortunately , have not yet achieved the desired results .  
Guaranteeing peace and collective security ; developing friendly relations among nations based on shared values ; promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and developing varied forms of cooperation in the economic , social , cultural and humanitarian fields these were the dreams of those who , 50 years ago , created the United Nations . 
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
They should , inter alia , pave the way for the active and global participation of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , in the work and procedures of the United Nations , including the Economic and Social Council , bearing in mind the shared responsibilities of these countries in the economic and social challenges facing today 's world .  
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
My country calls on the international community to ensure an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the new international trading system .  
We wish to stress the urgent need for the international community , particularly donor countries and international financial institutions , to adopt an effective , comprehensive and equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the debt problem of developing countries .  
If the developed countries are demanding protection for their sensitive domestic industries , then similar demands by developing countries with respect to their domestic industry should not be viewed as a request that is unreasonable or inconsistent with current international trends .  
The Meeting should therefore give high priority to undertaking a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , with a view to adopting specific and concrete measures to obviate adverse effects to the least developed countries and net food-importing developing countries arising from the implementation of the agreements ; reverse the marginalization of the least developed countries ; and strengthen their capacity to compete in the global economy .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
Thus , we are in no way , and to no degree , inhibited with regard to addressing inviting profound reflection on the issue of the special circumstances of small island developing States particularly those in the Caribbean region , where prominent among the features characterizing our special circumstances is the ever-present vulnerability to natural disaster and the widespread devastation resulting therefrom .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
We are also obliged to note that budgetary constraints faced by various developed countries , clarification of foreign aid objectives , revised conditions governing the granting of assistance , and the heightened competition among various regions for aid packages constitute a serious challenge for developing countries such as mine .  
The world was presented with a shocking and unfamiliar picture of my country , erasing the efforts of the national community to turn its back on its past and wiping out the efforts of Central Africans to devote themselves , within the framework of their sovereign choice , to the search for the means of developing the Central African Republic , with its vast potential in mining , agriculture and livestock and with its abundant rainfall .  
The Agenda for Development will be of no practical value to the developing countries if it limits itself to an analysis of the world economic outlook while failing to put forward specific action-oriented measures for implementation in an integrated and coordinated manner .  
In light of the vital role played by non-governmental organizations and the private sector in children 's advocacy , raising public and political awareness , mobilizing resources and fostering more active and systemic involvement should be encouraged at all levels , from developing and implementing strategies for the second half-decade to monitoring and assessing their progress .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
The same could be said of the International Council on Social Welfare , one of whose major initiatives had to do with a group of organizations which have constituted something termed Social Watch , an interregional effort by grass-roots and research groups operating in many countries which are developing national case studies and also compiling information at the global level on the specific purposes of the Summit . As can be seen , there is an enormous list . 
In this respect , my delegation wishes to express its appreciation to the Governments of Norway and the Netherlands for the meeting held at Oslo last April to review the implementation of the 20 / 20 initiative , which was enunciated in the Copenhagen Programme of Action , and which aims to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of basic social services to the poor and vulnerable in the developing world through a partnership between developed and developing countries . 
Globalization is a positive force for the future of the entire world : unprecedented development in investment and trade , the opening up of the most populous regions of the world to international trade ; and the possibility for more developing countries to improve their populations ' living standards .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 161 reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
Only when the international economic situation is conducive to development and international cooperation for development strengthened will the developing countries be in a realistic position to achieve any meaningful and lasting progress .  
Unrelenting poverty , especially among debt-strapped countries , widespread and worsening unemployment , a deepening environmental crisis and a growing technological and economic gap between developed and developing countries had focused attention on the plight of the human person . 
I am pleased to say that , through decisive action rather than words , we have made genuine strides in enlarging our dialogue and cooperation with friendly nations worldwide , developed and developing alike .  
Brazil is one of the world 's largest democracies , a dynamic and diversified developing economy , an attractive opportunity for productive foreign investment and a market of huge potential in a word , a country capable of enjoying fruitful ties with all nations on the basis of mutual respect and reciprocity .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
In this context , we believe that the current session of the General Assembly must approach with daring and political resolve all current issues of common concern , including those in the areas of international peacekeeping and security and the healing of the economic and social crisis that afflicts the developing world .  
Likewise , we are deeply concerned by the growth of the external debt of Africa and other developing countries , as well as by the heavy burden involved in debt servicing , which is one of the causes of the continuous economic and social deterioration of our standard of living .  
There are still many who need to be convinced that nuclear technology is the inevitable option for satisfying the energy needs of developing countries and that it is worthwhile supporting nuclear-technology based programmes and activities also in the fields of fresh water , food , health and the environment .  
The coordinated research programmes , training programmes and technical meetings must increasingly address more advanced areas of nuclear technology to benefit the increasing number of developing countries that are enhancing the level of sophistication and capabilities of their respective national nuclear programmes .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
The Italian proposal addresses and reconciles the two major changes that have occurred on the international scene since the end of the Second World War : first , the emergence of a group of countries with considerable economic and political capacities , including Italy , which by 1 January 1998 will be the fifth largest contributor to the United Nations budget ; and secondly , the emergence of the developing countries , which are far more numerous and important today than they were in 1965 , when the Security Council was enlarged .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
Morocco , which made an important contribution to the drafting of the Treaty , is convinced that this document will open the way for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons , strengthen international cooperation and promote the exchange of knowledge about the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , so that developing countries can achieve their economic and technical goals .  
Finally , in the context of the upcoming World Trade Organization Ministerial Meeting to be held in Singapore , it is essential for the future of Africa and the rest of the developing world that the increased opening of markets under way in our countries be accompanied by a genuine , far-reaching elimination of the trade barriers that still exist , thus ensuring access for the products of developing countries .  
Indeed , the argument that shortfalls in official development assistance have been compensated for by increased foreign direct investment flows to developing countries has not held true in the case of most African countries .  
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee report of May this year , entitled Shaping the Twenty-First Century , set out quantitative targets within prescribed time-frames , and the June 1996 economic communiqu of the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries called for a new partnership between developed and developing countries .  
I therefore wish to express Colombia 's support for the draft resolution before us , based on our commitment to the principle of respect for international law and to help promote freer , more vigorous and more transparent international trade allowing developing countries to strive for economic and social development .  
The efforts of developing countries in carrying out trade and macroeconomic reforms aimed at sustained economic growth can be impeded by the use of unilateral actions by major economies , in particular those with extraterritorial effects .  
But free trade is not just helpful to developing countries , it is a global good , its benefits are spread wide , to the producers and consumers in the developed and the developing world alike , who can profit from the greater efficiency that free trade engenders , and who can buy the best and cheapest products available on the world markets .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
New Zealand is convinced that developing mechanisms for non-governmental organization interaction with the United Nations system that do not alter its fundamental intergovernmental nature and that ensure that the Assembly and its committees are transparent and provide adequate access to civil society actors will be vital for the future health and credibility of the Organization .  
The Assembly has adopted a number of resolutions that have reflected its grave concern over the harmful effects suffered by the economies of developing countries and their developmental efforts as a result of these coercive economic measures , and over the negative effects of these measures on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to establish an open non-discriminatory trade system .  
Through all these resolutions , the General Assembly appealed to the international community to take urgent and effective measures to put an end to the use of coercive measures against developing countries , and called on developed countries to refrain from exercising political coercion as a means of effecting changes in the economic and social systems or in the internal and external policies of other countries .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
At their annual meetings in 1996 , foreign ministers both of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the Group of 77 called for the immediate elimination of all forms of coercive economic measures with negative , extraterritorial impact on the development of developing countries and which undermine the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations , the principles of international law and the free flow of trade and investment .  
Although it has been said euphemistically that the cold war is now over , we are still living amid an international order in which the major economic and political Power , taking advantage of its predominant position , is continuing unilaterally to apply coercive economic measures against developing countries not because of the danger these countries pose to the national security of that Power , as is usually alleged , but because of its manifest intent to impose upon those countries certain of its foreign policy objectives .  
In this connection , the Commission on Human Rights itself has determined that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has a negative impact on social and humanitarian indicators in developing countries , and prevents the peoples subjected to such measures from fully enjoying their rights .  
Furthermore , pursuant to resolution 1994 / 47 of the Commission on Human Rights , the Secretary-General informed that body , in his report contained in document E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 43 , that application of unilateral coercive measures is incompatible with the principle of international cooperation , has an adverse impact on the economies of developing countries suffering under the measures and constitutes a serious violation of the human rights of the individuals , groups and peoples affected .  
The transformation of the international economy and accelerated trends towards globalization have , to be sure , resulted in new , more complex relations , but have also , due to certain harmful side effects , aggravated the imbalances and the dependency of many developing countries , whose courageous economic reforms , achieved at the highest of costs , still confront a hostile environment .  
In this new era of heightened interdependence , a lack of solidarity still characterizes international relations , and self-interest is persistent in terms of both security and development , emphasizing the lack of a mechanism that can effectively narrow the growing gap between developed countries ever more prosperous and stable and a developing world faced with poverty and disorder of every sort .  
The worsening of the external , bilateral and multilateral debt crisis of developing countries ; the erosion and unpredictable nature of resources from export earnings ; restrictions on access to markets ; the lack of fairness in international trade ; one-sided views which affect cooperation ; and the unilateral nature of the world decision-making process : all these highlight in different ways the various obstacles which remain on the path to development .  
While welcoming the Secretary-General designate , the Asian countries would like to pay tribute to the outgoing Secretary-General , Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , for his valuable contribution in guiding the work of the United Nations in the pursuit of its noble aims , finding just solutions to disputes , developing international cooperation in various fields , proposing the concepts of preventive diplomacy and post-conflict peace-building , and for his evolutionary vision of development , which have been duly reflected in the Secretary-General 's reports on an Agenda for Peace and on an Agenda for Development .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation . 
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development [ 7 ] / it is pointed out that although the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community ,  
Decides that the basic problem of improving the capacity of developing countries and economies in transition to capture the maximum sustainable economic and social benefits of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session , and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a discussion paper on this topic , with the assistance of members of the Committee .  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
Provide assistance to and involve in the implementation of the programme partners in related fields who have developed or are developing skills related to communication , local enterprises whose practical knowledge and technique on communication have been tested and confirmed , and training and research establishments that constitute regional or national centres of excellence .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Most of these countries were pursuing the following similar paths to increase or improve the quality of reproductive health services : ( a ) developing human resources , including training of medical and / or paramedical staff in reproductive health ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ; ( c ) developing medical protocols for RH / FP services ; and ( d ) increasing the availability of reproductive health services .  
It is clear that the difficult , and at times unfavourable , economic situation faced by many developing countries and countries with economies in transition , the dwindling resources allocated by the international donor community for official development assistance ( ODA ) , and unfavourable internal conditions need to be fully addressed in order to successfully implement reproductive health programmes and to reach the goal of reproductive health by the year 2015 .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
Thus , aware of the delicate situation in this regard faced by the Republic of Georgia , we wish to express our firm support for the activities of the Special Envoy and his resident Deputy , and for the initiatives of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , Mr . Ayala Lasso , as well as for the cooperation in this regard of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , which is developing a programme specifically to deal with these urgent tasks .  
The vast majority of the people in developing countries live in rural areas , with daily nutritional intake below basic requirements , high infant mortality rates , shorter life expectancy than that in industrialized countries and limited or no access to safe water and sanitation . 
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
A much-needed increase in productivity of rural areas of developing countries , in terms of agricultural output and processing , would require supplies of efficient , modern fuels for mechanized agriculture , rural transport and operating of essential tools and machineries . 
As industrialization proceeds in the dynamic developing economies and middle-income developing countries , rising standards of living and rapid urbanization will contribute to strong growth in electricity demand and petroleum consumption will rise from an increase in private motor transport .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Nevertheless , developing countries will require substantial investments considering that their total primary energy demand will continue to grow ; and even though the demand is expected to moderate , the outlook , as mentioned above , projects that , in a couple of decades , their total primary energy consumption may account for one half or more of global consumption . 
The outlook for natural gas consumption in developing countries is for continued steady growth , given that many of these countries have indigenous gas resources that can be developed or expanded for domestic use , and considering their high electricity demand growth and the economic and environmental benefits of additional gas use ( see figure X ) . 
Electricity has increasingly assumed greater importance in the total energy mix of developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as being central to economic and social development .  
Energy is a critical factor in sustainable economic and social progress and development and , this being the case , developing countries are concerned about having secure and affordable sources of energy .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
He outlined four major problems that the developing world is encountering today : poverty , the inability to mobilize capital , low efficiency and environmental pollution , all of which are closely linked .  He argued convincingly that the challenge before the global community today is to break the link between low incomes and the poor use of energy in developing countries .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
In resolution 45 / 209 , the Assembly stressed the need for comprehensive national , bilateral and multilateral measures to accelerate the exploration and development of energy resources in developing countries , and the need to take into consideration environmental and developmental concerns as they applied to all countries in accordance with their respective capabilities and their responsibilities for global environmental degradation .  
The Council acknowledged the need to facilitate access for developing countries to energy-efficient technologies and research , and called upon the international community , including developed countries , to make technologies and financial resources available to the developing countries to enable them to fully develop their potential capability in the field of new and renewable sources of energy , including their vast hydropower resources .  
Before the year 2000 , a global initiative should be launched by the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) , the World Bank , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other interested organizations with the support of donor countries in order to facilitate the efforts of the developing countries to develop and implement a massive effort to bring electrical power to the people in rural and isolated areas , based on successes already achieved in renewable energy technologies , such as photovoltaic , wind and mini-hydro ;  
Other recommendations included the need to identify pivotal countries to serve as catalysts for promoting and implementing TCDC , the promotion of triangular cooperation arrangements under which donors agreed to fund exchanges among developing countries , the identification of subject-specific TCDC products , the expansion of TCDC-INRES into a multidimensional database , including information on several relevant centres of excellence , expert services and project experiences , as well as supporting the already existing institutional capacities in the developing countries .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the tenth session , as approved at the ninth session , taking fully into account the results of the ninth session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Reaffirms the agreement to a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
The concept of eco-efficiency , which is concerned with maximizing the productivity of energy and material inputs in order to reduce resource consumption and pollution / waste per unit output , is currently seen as a promising short - to medium-term strategy , appropriate in both developed and developing countries , for maintaining economic growth and competitiveness while achieving improved environmental quality ( the double dividend ) .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
One important achievement in 1995 was the continued operation within a relatively modest budget of a space network ( comprising telecommunications and television , the Mir manned orbital station , space research and technological development , navigational safety , tracking of vessels in distress , topographic geodesy and cartography , and remote sensing of the Earth ) designed for the purpose of implementing the Russian national space programme and aimed at achieving greater economic stability , further developing science and technology , improving the country 's security and intensifying its international cooperation activities .  
In view of those difficulties , the Government was developing a policy that combined campaigns to eradicate stereotypes in several areas , ranging from the sharing of domestic responsibilities to the role of the media , with the establishment of affirmative action programmes in the public and private sectors .  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Reaffirms that the restitution to a country of its objets d'art , monuments , museum pieces , archives , manuscripts , documents and any other cultural or artistic treasures contributes to the strengthening of international cooperation and to the preservation and flowering of universal cultural values through fruitful cooperation between developed and developing countries ;  
Recognizing that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Commending continuing efforts made by developing countries to create a more favourable national framework and stressing that a considerable number of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , especially in Africa , have not benefited from the aforementioned capital flows ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Noting also that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Stresses the need for finding effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of the poorest and most indebted developing countries and the importance of a full , constructive and expeditious implementation of the Naples terms , agreed upon in the Paris Club in December 1994 , for such countries , with a view to helping them exit from the rescheduling process on the basis of sound economic policies in those countries , thus contributing to the promotion of their prospects for resuming growth and development ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
Recognizes the urgent need for the international community to assist developing countries , in particular the poorest and heavily indebted countries , in mobilizing the resources needed for their development efforts , and also recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries could contribute towards releasing domestic resources and sustaining their development efforts , in particular those for social development ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizing that the developing countries have made a major contribution to the success of the Uruguay Round , in particular by accepting the challenges of trade liberalization reforms and measures , and stressing that there is a need for positive efforts designed to ensure that developing countries , especially the least developed among them , secure a share in the growth in international trade commensurate with their economic development needs ,  
Recognizing also that the subregional and regional economic integration processes , including those among developing countries , which have intensified in recent years , impart substantial dynamism to global trade and enhance trade and development possibilities for all countries , and stressing that , in order to maintain the positive aspects of such integration arrangements and to assure the prevalence of their dynamic growth effects , Member States and groupings should be outward oriented and supportive of the multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .  
It was recognized that , while private capital flows to developing countries could make an important contribution to growth and development , many of those inflows were in the form of portfolio investment rather than direct investment in productive capacity , and their distribution among developing countries was uneven , with countries needing capital most being unable to attract them .  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies . 
The current supply of energy to rural areas of developing countries where the bulk of the population live is inadequate ; there is therefore an urgent need to expand substantially the supply of energy , including rural electrification , to stimulate economic growth or at least help arrest , reverse and eventually eradicate poverty , which is rampant in these areas .  
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
In view of the conclusions of the Colloquium , it had been decided that it would be worthwhile for UNCITRAL to attempt to provide a legislative framework to limit uncertainty in settlement of cross-border insolvency cases , for example , by drawing up model legal provisions and incorporating provisions on access and recognition in the text that it prepared .  The Commission had therefore decided to assign to a working group the task of developing a model legislative framework for judicial cooperation and for access and recognition .  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
His delegation rejected the draft resolution , particularly the provisions concerning the deployment of human rights monitors throughout Iraqi territory , since those provisions violated the principles of national sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States and might set an alarming precedent for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Other key elements of a poverty reduction strategy include policies geared to [ reducing inequalities , increasing opportunities , and providing access to resources and income ; ] providing social protection for those who can not support themselves ; recognizing the special needs and skills of women ; developing human resource ; improving accessible infrastructure including communication facilities ; and [ taking comprehensive national responsibility for meeting ] the basic needs of all .  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
Implementing the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of human settlements in the small island developing States , in particular by providing effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for human settlements programmes , in accordance with the Declaration of Barbados and on the basis of relevant provisions of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and land-locked countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 ;  
Stresses the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
The resources available for applied climate science are already far from adequate and the increased involvement of the socio-economic research community in developing and understanding human influences on atmospheric processes is expected to call for substantial increase in funding over the next decade .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
The negative impacts of imports barriers by developed countries on the pace of forest-based industrialization in developing countries are not expected to lead to increased export of raw wood because of the many restrictions on raw wood exports imposed by most tropical timber exporting countries .  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
Due to tight budgets in developed countries , developing countries and economies in transition , policy makers are showing increasing interest in saving on scarce budgetary resources by launching reviews of existing subsidy regimes .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The present section ( i ) summarizes a number of environmental measures developed by government and industry , and wider production / consumption trends , that could have implications for developing countries ; and ( ii ) reviews current work of United Nations and other organizations aimed at improving the understanding of these potential impacts .  
However , the issues covered in this section are of major concern to industrialized and developing countries alike , though different objectives and priorities will be stressed in different circumstances .  For example , waste reduction and avoidance is a priority for countries facing acute shortages of disposal capacity ( e.g .  
A wide variety of product and material taxes have been employed in OECD and developing countries to encourage more efficient use ( e.g . , pesticide taxes in Indonesia , fertilizer taxes in Scandinavia ) , to discourage / phase out certain substances ( e.g . , taxes on PVC and CFCs ) or to discourage the use of disposable products ( e.g . , plastic and paper tableware in Denmark , throwaway razors in the Netherlands ) .  
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
Agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and in this context , the proposal of the Government of Norway to host a meeting in 1996 among interested countries and representatives of relevant international institutions , with a view to considering how the 20 / 20 initiative can be applied operationally , is welcomed ;  
Support United Nations development efforts by substantially increasing the resources for operational activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries as stated in General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , while giving particular consideration to the special needs of LDCs as underlined in the programmes of action of major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
Other specific areas that have been mentioned as deserving future attention include , inter alia , persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals ( preparatory work initiated for developing protocols to the 1979 ECE Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution ) ; joint implementation and tradable permits ; protection of marine biodiversity ; protection of inland waters ; protection of the soils ; mountain ecosystems ; introduction of genetically modified and alien organisms ; child labour ; and environmental impact assessment .  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects , benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , viz . , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
From 1980 emphasis has been placed on the role of the public sector in promoting the economic development of developing countries , with auxiliary activities concentrating on the role of qualified national personnel in the social and economic development of developing countries , and specialized topics such as the International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade , the development of human resources , or United Nations programmes of action for African economic recovery and development .  
For the past 45 years , pursuant to its various legislative mandates , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
Current assessment of most developing and transitional economies demonstrates that national Governments may need international support and cooperation in improving their public administration systems and training their personnel for initiating and implementing dynamic social programmes .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
Noting the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , concerning the problem of internal displacement ,  
Concerning the definition of an aerospace object , while we agree generally with question 1 , which considers the twofold capacity to travel and to fly into orbit as a specific characteristic of the aerospace object , we nevertheless admit that this interpretation is closely linked with the developing technology , and therefore we advise , in view of a possible legal definition consistent with the technological evolution , to thoroughly examine the aerospace object requisites . 
Bearing in mind that the increasing number of women living in poverty in developing countries , especially in the rural areas and urban slums , requires the urgent action of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures at the national and regional levels towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , [ 2 ] / adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women ,  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
A significant increase in private sector investment for environmental protection also occurred in the newly industrialized developing countries , while in economies in transition a marked increase is expected in the future , in particular in economies with a rapid rate of privatization of industries .  
Article 44 of the amended Constitution stipulated that in using frequency bands for radio services , member administrations should bear in mind that radio frequencies and the geostationary-satellite orbit were limited natural resources which must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , so that countries or groups of countries could have equitable access to both , taking account of the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
ITU had been instrumental in the establishment of the World Telecommunication Organization ( WorldTel ) , a cooperative body financed by private investors from industrialized countries which assisted developing countries in providing access to telecommunication facilities for a large segment of their population through the introduction of cost-effective technologies and the creation of a liberal economic environment .  
43 His delegation considered that any draft text prepared by the Subcommittee on the utilization of the geostationary orbit should mention chapter VII , article 44 , No . 196 , paragraph 2 , of the Constitution of ITU , which indicated that the geostationary-satellite orbit was a limited natural resource and must be used rationally , efficiently and economically , and that countries or groups of countries must have equitable access to it , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
The General Assembly in resolution 50 / 146 , paragraph 9 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly UNDP Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
For geographical reasons Ecuador had demonstrated great interest in the geostationary orbit , which was a limited natural resource with special characteristics , and for which there should be a sui generis legal regime regulating access to and utilization of the orbit and guaranteeing equitable access to it , with account being taken of the relative disadvantages of the developing countries .  
The previous report , in describing the activities concerned , paid particular attention to projects aimed at enhancing the capacity of developing countries and countries with economies in transition to develop effective foreign investment policies and negotiate mining agreements and to develop and implement adequate social policies to respond to the ongoing trend towards privatization of the mining sector .  
However , while most developing countries and countries in transition are enthusiastic about encouraging foreign investment in mining , not all are capable of making the necessary macroeconomic changes and implementing the necessary legal and fiscal regimes that would be acceptable to the international mining community in a timely manner .  
In certain of the more advanced developing countries , the early introduction of radical reforms into mineral development policies and the associated fiscal and regulatory environments aimed at attracting private funds into the mining sector and at securing foreign expertise to improve the management and efficiency of State-owned , controlled and operated companies , are slowly starting to show benefits with respect to impact on the socio-economic area .  
This can be accomplished by introducing a consultative process with involved stakeholders , introducing necessary laws and regulations in consultation with world-wide industry and multi-disciplinary groups , developing technical norms and standards , collecting environmental baseline data and protecting locally affected groups and indigenous people .  
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Furthermore , the General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services , stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , and expressed its appreciation for the provision of the services of two interregional advisers .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
The transportation sector is of considerable interest not only because of its importance as a source of greenhouse gas emissions but also because of the effects on human health and the environment associated with other pollutants and a number of other issues , such as traffic accidents , congestion , noise , impeded access to cities , competition for land use and restricted access of the poor to basic services - problems that are of increasing importance in developing countries .  
It should be possible to quadruple the goods and services that could be produced with a given quantity of natural resources and energy , which would enable developing countries to quadruple their production and consumption without increasing their environmental impact , while the developed countries could maintain their standard of living while greatly reducing their environmental impact .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
To the extent that hazardous wastes exported to developing countries result in the contamination of soil and adjacent waters , they may reduce future productivity and economic uses of those natural resources , besides endangering human , animal and plant life .  
Quantitative analysis of the effectiveness of the Basel Convention remains difficult , largely because of a lack of reliable data related to hazardous waste generation ; an absence of comparable data between national authorities ; the absence of accurate baseline data for reported global trade in hazardous wastes ; lack of clear definitions of wastes considered to be " hazardous " ; and the absence of one major industrialized country and several developing countries as parties to the Convention .  
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
It emphasized that the principle of a common but differentiated responsibility for developing and developed countries , as outlined in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development , should be applied in any development of measures to protect the atmosphere on a global scale .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
The significant gap between developed and developing countries in current fossil energy carbon emissions becomes even larger when the historical dimension is considered : because of the long lifetime of atmospheric carbon , estimates indicate that about 84 per cent of the fossil energy carbon dioxide still remaining in the atmosphere since 1800 can be attributed to emissions from the now industrialized countries .  
The greatest relative potential for improving efficiency exists in the developing countries , followed by the transitional economies , because of the prevalence of traditional economic patterns and inefficient energy end-use technologies in those areas .  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
In developing demand management policy , a water agency must choose among combinations of numerous legislative , regulatory , technological and behavioral measures , each with a unique set of advantages and disadvantages .  
Both sides believe that it is necessary for the United Nations to formulate an Agenda for Development based on General Assembly resolutions and hope that the conclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development will help the international community achieve the objective of sustainable development , contribute to the economic growth and social development of the developing countries and promote international cooperation and global development .  
ACC members shared the position expressed by the Secretary-General in his report on the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , cited in paragraph 1 above . a / The General Assembly in paragraph 42 of resolution 47 / 199 , recognized the cost factor and indicated that common premises and the consolidation of administrative infrastructures should be achieved without increasing the costs for the United Nations system or for developing countries .  
The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
The Committee concluded that global demand was likely to increase for the foreseeable future , mainly as a result of the continuing increase in global population through most of the next century , and of the demand for improved living standards in developing countries .  
Recalling that in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development it is pointed out that while the global wealth of nations has multiplied sevenfold in the past fifty years , the situation of most developing countries , and particularly of Africa and the least developed countries , is critical and requires special attention and action , and that countries with economies in transition also require the support of the international community , 
Decides that the basic problem of improving the capacity of developing countries and economies in transition to capture the economic and social benefits of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session , and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a discussion paper on this topic , with the assistance of members of the Committee .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
If followed through to a logical conclusion , a multisectoral , system-wide programming approach could facilitate work with the vulnerable rural youth audience by dealing with all aspects of the drug problem through a number of simultaneous activities including programmes in formal and non-formal education and competency-based training , demand reduction , construction of health facilities and addressing related health issues , law enforcement and crime prevention issues , alternative crop production and other drug-related issues in any given country .  NULLOrganizational approach to developing a multiple agency ,  
In developing further the orientation and objectives of national strategies , the Commission may wish to focus on the identification of characteristics of poverty which could be common to most countries , regardless of their definition of poverty and which could be used to measure progress ; the identification of elements for elaborating national strategies comprising macroeconomic , structural , distributional and regulatory policies , together with specific short - and long-term objectives ; and the further identification of specific international actions .  
An important policy question in many countries concerns the future role of different forms of community-initiated programmes , particularly their relationship with established , organized voluntary or charitable organizations , their role in delivering publicly financed services , and , on the one hand , the compatibility of their advocacy role in support of the poor and disadvantaged , and on the other , their role as partners in developing and implementing public policy . 
Interested developed and developing country partners should reflect their mutual commitment by allocating , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance , including contributions through multilateral organizations and non-governmental organizations and 20 per cent of the national budgets ( net of aid ) , respectively , to basic social services , as soon as possible and preferably by the year 2000 .  
The meeting invited interested developing countries and donor Governments and multilateral organizations to review policy frameworks , plans of action and basic social services programmes , with identified national and external financing requirements , in all appropriate forums , in particular consultative group and round-table meetings .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
To assist Governments , at their request , in developing the necessary capabilities to enable public administration to implement the commitments agreed upon at major United Nations conferences in an effective and coordinated manner , ensuring the maintenance of essential basic government services and functions during times of crisis and developing strategies for rebuilding a viable public administration in countries undergoing post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction ;  
Reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
In its decision 96 / 15 , entitled " Allocation of resources to country programmes of the United Nations Population Fund " , the Executive Board reaffirmed that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there was a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
As is strongly reaffirmed in paragraph 5 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 , the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 50 / 120 .  
Also , while trying to reconstruct their economy and lay the foundations for their future State , the Palestinians were aware of the need for eventual integration into a larger economic context and developing mutually beneficial ties with countries of the Middle East , North Africa and the Mediterranean basin .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
The importance of closer cooperation is recognized by all Governments , although some developing countries - while encouraging this development - are concerned that it might lead to new conditionalities and make operational activities within the United Nations system subject to the restrictive policies normally attached to loans .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
From 1973 to 1992 , the total official development assistance for all developing countries registered a remarkable stability ranging from 0.32 per cent to 0.34 per cent of donor gross national product .  
Island developing countries should seek to exploit fully , within the limits of sustainability , their agricultural potential and marine resources in the exclusive economic zones by enhancing relevant skills and carrying out specialized studies on the conservation , management and surveillance of these resources .  
In view of the small size constraint faced by many island developing countries , special efforts should be made to promote regional cooperation arrangements that offer a viable framework for realizing economies of scale in various economic activities , particularly with regard to resource exploitation , protection and policing of coast lines and exclusive economic zones , environmental protection , market access , development and sharing of human resources , expansion of inter-island feeder services , tourism development and exchange of information on successes and failures in various areas of development .  
Subregional , regional and international organizations dealing with trade-related issues should stand ready to provide the required technical assistance to strengthen the efficiency of the external sectors of island developing countries , including their capacity to negotiate in international forums and with foreign partners such as private investors .  
UNCTAD , in its field of competence and in collaboration with relevant regional and international organizations as well as non-governmental organizations , should be prepared to extend to island developing countries its technical cooperation capacity in respect of policies for sustainable economic development .  
The FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 1995 endorsed the creation of a Fisheries Technical Assistance Programme for small island developing States , focusing on the following priority areas , as identified by countries : institutional strengthening and capacity-building ; conservation and management of fisheries in the exclusive economic zone ; improved post-harvest management and marketing ; safety at sea ; strengthening the economic role of national fisheries industries ; and aquaculture and inland fisheries conservation and management .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
Thus , an advanced and prosperous State using flooding as a means of irrigation may be required to develop a more efficient , less wasteful system ; on the other hand , a developing State using the same method may be granted additional time to obtain the resources needed for the required improvements .  
In accordance with the recommendation of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space concerning the development of indigenous capabilities , General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in which the Assembly endorsed the recommendation of the Committee that the United Nations should lead , with the active support of its specialized agencies and other international organizations , an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology in existing national / regional educational institutions in the developing countries , and resolution 50 / 27  
The tools available are assessment based on analysis of existing reliable country information ( already applied for the developing countries ) , sampling of high resolution satellite data ( already applied for tropical countries ) , organization of existing reliable information using GIS ( already applied for developing countries ) , questionnaires supported by a network of country correspondents ( applied in industrialized countries ) , and special studies undertaken by consultants or cooperating partners .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
The report highlights important findings announced at the London meeting , namely , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominately cereal diets of most developing countries .  
The following narratives of ESCAP assistance to the concerned countries include : ( i ) adoption of the international standards and practices of countries with market economies , ( ii ) analytical activities , policy advice and technical assistance to the economies in transition , and ( iii ) possible ways of enhancing economic and technical cooperation among countries with economies in transition and with developing countries , in particular through cooperation with regional and subregional groupings .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
A major regional project covering 26 countries in eastern Europe and CIS was launched in 1995 and executed by ECE to assist national statistical offices in developing the human resources necessary for building self-sustainable capabilities for the collection , processing and analysis of reliable social and demographic statistics , and enabling the appropriate governmental institutions and agencies of these countries to monitor the social aspects of development .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 reflects the following priorities : maintenance of peace and security , promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective response to humanitarian emergencies ; and promotion of justice and international law .  
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
In developing countries , however , the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated among a few countries with export potential while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
By its resolutions 44 / 215 , 46 / 210 , 48 / 168 and 50 / 96 , the General Assembly urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
The Panel recognized the importance of international cooperation for the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , particularly in developing countries , in spite of the fact that it was each country 's responsibility to develop policies that would create an enabling environment for private , bilateral and multilateral investments in the forest sector .  
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
During its sixteenth session , in January 1996 , the Council decided to give priority , in its future activities , to regional and subregional projects , and reaffirmed its support of projects aiming , in particular at improving the quality of communication for development ; promoting freedom of the press , pluralism and independence of the media ; promoting democracy and human rights ; supporting activities for broader participation of women in the media ; and developing community media etc .  
As reported in the annual overview report for 1993 , the information received regarding additional measures or special assistance in response to the immediate hardships encountered and urgent needs faced by the affected countries was largely of a preliminary nature , which reflected the need to assess the extent of the impact of sanctions on the economies of the affected countries in order to assist them in developing appropriate policy responses and in preparing financial requirements for remedial measures . 
In its resolution 50 / 203 , the General Assembly reaffirmed that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , would also be required . 
The prospective growth environment for developing countries will depend not only on their continuing significant policy adjustments but also on sustained and strong momentum in global trade liberalization leading to rapid growth in world trade .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Apart from considering substantive issues related to the integration and more active participation of developing countries in the multilateral trading system , this meeting also demonstrated the strong will of the above organizations for joint cooperation and a tangible manifestation of complementarity among them .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
Activities being initiated include reviewing the current state of interpreting modelling work for sustainable development ; formulating recommendations for improving existing integrated modelling work for sustainable development ; developing a linked set of models for integrated global and regional assessments of sustainable development ; stimulating the development and use of integrated models in developing countries ; and providing support to relevant activities of different bodies . 
It will also draw up specific programmes as follow-up to the decisions taken in Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable Development regarding the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional financial resources to developing countries , and mechanisms for the transfer of technology to those countries , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed in paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 " .  
Some delegations underlined the difficult situation and the special needs and requirements of developing countries as a result of environmental degradation and emphasized the need for international support to deal with those problems through projects prepared and implemented by UNEP , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and other relevant organizations .  
In response to the Summit 's call for increased cooperation at all levels , the regional commissions are expected to play a major role in supporting the implementation of the objectives set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action , in particular to assist developing countries , Africa and the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition .  
In its resolution 50 / 161 , the General Assembly reaffirmed the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing countries to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The limited information obtained from national sources shows that a number of small island developing States have begun to implement parts of the Programme of Action that have especially high priority at the national level , including institution-building , particularly the strengthening of legislative frameworks ; waste management ; coastal area management ; and to a lesser extent , the preservation of biodiversity .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
The Ministers agreed to reduce dependence on the information and cultural media of the industrialized nations by initiating and supporting cooperative activities through fresh and dynamic approaches to programming , message content and networking in the media systems of non-aligned and other developing countries .  
The Ministers emphasized the need for information and communication strategies to be rooted in deep historical and cultural processes , and urged that the views , models and perspectives of the media of developed countries not be allowed to determine to an undue extent the style and orientation of media policies in developing countries .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 49 / 108 on industrial development cooperation , inter alia , stressed the importance of industrialization to the economic and social development of developing countries ; emphasized the importance of industrial development cooperation ; reaffirmed the central coordinating role played by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) in the United Nations system in the field of industrial development in the developing countries ; and welcomed the process of reform and restructuring of UNIDO .  
In their aspirations to raise standards of living , the developing countries are following the example of the already industrialized countries , and by seeking to build up efficient industrial capacities have chosen the only viable route to achieve lasting economic growth and escape the vicious circle of poverty .  
It is patently clear - and accepted throughout the developing world - that functioning markets and private initiative are among the most efficient and powerful mechanisms to generate wealth and thus permit increased standards of living .  
We express our commitment to the elaboration and implementation of a strategy for the physical integration of the region , aware of the urgent task of developing an adequate transport and communications infrastructure , and we therefore call on the competent national authorities to pursue their efforts in that direction . 
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
In 1994 , the United States of America , Canada , the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Australia experienced relatively strong economic growth ; economic recovery accelerated in continental Europe ; Japan started to show signs of improved economic activities ; and the developing economies experienced above average growth rates .  
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1566 ( L ) , the Council considered that the ultimate goal of the work of the Commission should be the achievement of an integrated system in the collection , data processing and dissemination of international statistics by the organs and agencies of the United Nations system with special regard to the requirements of reviewing and appraising economic and social progress , taking into account the needs of the developing countries . 
To promote awareness , both in developed and in developing countries , of the social , economic and environmental implications of national and international population problems , of the human rights aspects of family planning , and of possible strategies to deal with them , in accordance with the plans and priorities of each country ;  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .  
The Assembly requested relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions to strengthen their efforts to assist interested developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national water policies and strategies , and called upon the international community to give special attention to the revitalization of economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries , through , inter alia , a more diversified food and agriculture sector .  
Better market access abroad and better trade and trade-related policies at home are also important : they can help to raise agricultural ( and other sectors ' ) productivity , income and employment , and at least indirectly help to overcome the wider impediments to economic development and food security in developing countries , including by making those countries more attractive for , and increasing the efficiency of , foreign direct investment ( through the transfer of capital , skills , technology and marketing channels ) , official aid and technical assistance .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
Furthermore , the Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services , stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , and requested the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen the Programme by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandates . 
Governments recognized UNCTAD 's technical cooperation programme as an important element in providing practical assistance to developing countries , especially those with the greatest need , and committed themselves to strengthening its effectiveness and impact as an essential complement to the institution 's policy-oriented analytical and deliberative work .  
Nevertheless , there were some problems of a more fundamental nature , such as the facts that full and prompt delivery of revenues was not possible because of late payments by many Member States , that a number of Member States were deliberately violating the obligations entered into under the Charter with regard to the operation of the methodology and that severe imbalances in the distribution of revenue-sourcing were inevitable while so many developing countries continued to be impoverished by the existing economic system .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
At the same time , in many developing countries , the formulation of coherent and implementable national strategies is contingent on adequate international support , technical and financial .  
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation also expressed the urgent need for the international community to call upon certain developed countries immediately to eliminate laws and regulations with adverse extra-territorial impacts and other forms of coercive economic measures against developing countries .  
They called upon the developed countries to make every effort to coordinate their macroeconomic policies , including through multilateral institutions in which developing countries are represented , so as to stimulate the world economy through increased demand , stabilized markets and further liberalized trade , and thereby provide a conducive international economic environment for development .  
The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Heads of Delegation called for urgent and immediate generation of political will in the international community to follow up and implement the recommendations of recent United Nations conferences , in particular commitments to new and additional financing for development and creation of a favourable international economic environment , inter alia , through transfer of technology and enhanced trade access of products from developing countries .  
They expressed their concern over the deterioration of the food and agriculture situation in developing countries , reaffirmed the need to achieve food security and sustainable agricultural policies as fundamental objectives of development and asserted that the right to food was a fundamental human right , the respect and promotion of which constitute a moral imperative for the international community .  
Israel 's refusal to adhere to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons , when it possesses enormous numbers of nuclear weapons , is developing other weapons of mass destruction and the means of their delivery and refuses to place its facilities under international supervision and International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards , not only flouts the wishes of the international community but also constitutes a grave and persistent threat to the security and the future of the peoples of the region and , consequently , to international peace and security .  
Mr . SERIWA ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that his delegation supported the statement on the question of ageing made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China . Despite the encouraging growth in the global economy , economic and social conditions in many developing countries , particularly in Africa , were still disturbing , owing to a large number of external factors such as an increased debt-burden .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
Mr . MAHUGU ( Kenya ) , after endorsing the statement made by Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , said that while current economic indicators revealed widespread world economic growth , with the developing countries having registered an aggregate GDP growth of over 5 per cent , that growth rate concealed sharp regional , subregional and national differences .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
Further deepening of the development process would require an internationally agreed framework that would facilitate the stable , non-discriminatory and reasonable access of developing countries to technology , on the basis of a more transparent , critical and objective evaluation of the restrictions imposed on the grounds of alleged " dual use " .  
Like many developing countries , it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries ' failure to contribute , in clear and specific terms , the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Third , the multilateral system should be strengthened ; in that regard , the ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , to be held in Singapore , would focus on improving market access for developing countries and on the contribution of regional cooperation to the global integration process .  
If current positive trends continued , and special programmes were implemented to assist marginalized countries which did not yet share in the benefits of globalization , it would be possible to establish a more equitable and mutually beneficial partnership between developed and developing countries .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
Mr . MWAKAWAGO ( United Republic of Tanzania ) said that the international community was looking forward to the twenty-first century with a mixture of hope and despair : hope for the opportunities created by the liberalized and globalized markets of the future , and despair over the persisting high levels of poverty , especially in developing countries , which could undermine the advantages deriving from expanded markets and global partnership , unless the vicious cycle of poverty was broken and a process of economic recovery and growth was initiated .  
Also reaffirms that , in order to achieve the goals of the International Conference on Population and Development , there is a need for adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels as well as of new and additional resources to developing countries from all sources , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , and calls upon those countries in a position to do so to increase their contributions to the United Nations Population Fund ;  
In a statement of 23 April 1996 on the situation of human rights in Colombia , the Chairman of the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to proceed , upon the initiative of the Government of Colombia and the identification of adequate sources of financing , to establish at the earliest possible date a permanent office in Colombia to assist the Colombian authorities in developing policies and programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights and to observe violations of human rights in the country , making analytical reports to the High Commissioner .  
In 1994-1995 , following the support provided in the area of health policy and planning as well as in definition of proposals for decentralized projects through bilaterals , WHO 's work focused on the following : definition of a post-war strategy for rehabilitation of the public health sector and sustained development ; definition of possible health-care financing alternative ; technical support and training of nationals in developing a health insurance scheme ; completing policy frameworks on resource allocation and urban health care ; and providing technical support in the areas of health insurance .  
In 1995-1996 , the United Nations Industrial Development Organization 's ( UNIDO ) technical cooperation programmes with the front-line States focused on , inter alia , the following : developing support strategies and formulating policies for accelerated industrial development ; providing support for developing existing industries and industrial infrastructures ; private sector development with emphasis on strengthening private sector institutions ; small and medium enterprises development ; and industrial information investment and technology promotion .  
The issue of resources for operational activities , however , was particularly important because , in the view of her delegation , if resources could not be increased on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired , developing countries ' development programmes would be jeopardized and , in the long run , international development cooperation would be affected .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
Are convinced that sustainable development and the utilization of solar energy would be enhanced by local and national capacity-building , policy reform and technology-sharing among nations , with an emphasis on coherent efforts towards technology acquisition and development in the developing countries . 
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Urges all States to strive for effective and harmonious international cooperation in carrying out the work of the Agency , pursuant to its statute ; in promoting the use of nuclear energy and the application of the necessary measures to strengthen further the safety of nuclear installations and to minimize risks to life , health and the environment ; in strengthening technical assistance and cooperation for developing countries ; and in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards systems of the Agency ;  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Urges all States to strive for effective and harmonious international cooperation in carrying out the work of the Agency , pursuant to its statute ; in promoting the use of nuclear energy and the application of the necessary measures to strengthen further the safety of nuclear installations and to minimize risks to life , health and the environment ; in strengthening technical assistance and cooperation for developing countries ; and in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of the safeguards systems of the Agency ;  
Expressing its solidarity with the people and countries that suffer as a result of natural disasters and expressing also the deepest sympathy to all victims of the natural disasters that have struck in various parts of the globe , Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
That being said , it was obvious that there were still dramatic variations between regions , and the question was whether the current relatively robust growth in the developing countries as a whole would translate itself into a widespread improvement of living conditions and especially into poverty reduction worldwide . 
The United Nations system had been a major actor in promoting a holistic approach to development - linking social , economic and environmental considerations - in all the developing countries , as evidenced by the organization and outcome of a number of international conferences , especially the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , the International Conference on Population and Development , the World Summit for Social Development , and the Fourth World Conference on Women . 
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
Now that the countries of the Rio Group had implemented the adjustments and modernizations required for their social and economic development , and in order to achieve the objectives of the Declaration on International Economic Cooperation and the International Development Strategy , it was to be hoped that the developed countries would also assume their responsibility to create a favourable international environment for cooperation and economic development , especially with regard to the developing countries .  
Although each country was responsible for its own economic policy , the reactivation of economic growth and development in all countries required a coordinated effort by the entire international community ; accordingly , particular attention should be paid to the needs of countries with economies in transition , without thereby reducing assistance to developing countries . 
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Welcomes action at the national and regional level by small island developing States , and invites all Governments , with the assistance of international and regional organizations , to continue to support and to provide information on all of their major activities under the Programme of Action so as to enable an adequate review of the aforementioned action taken at the national and regional level ;  
To initiate action , including consultations with Parties and relevant international organizations , inter alia , taking into account the ongoing work of the Climate Technology Initiative , to identify existing technology information activities and needs , with a view to developing options for building on existing specialized information centres and networks to provide fast and one-stop databases relating to state-of-the-art , environmentally sound and economically feasible technology and know-how in a manner that would be readily accessible to developing countries .  
In providing the financial resources needed by developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 4.1 of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.3 , take steps to facilitate this provision of financial resources , including the enhancement of transparency and the flexible and pragmatic application of its concept of incremental costs on a case-by-case basis ;  
It should also be acknowledged that some of the developing countries seeking permanent membership have earned their rightful place through manifold contributions to the purposes and objectives of the United Nations , especially in the field of security and peacekeeping , and because of political and economic realities , proven competence in conflict prevention and resolution , the promotion of regional harmony and the building of an edifice of confidence and concord .  
The delegation of the United Arab Emirates supports the positive proposals submitted by the Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement to the General Assembly , which , inter alia , stressed that the expansion of the Security Council should not result in an increase in the number of permanent members from developed countries at the expense of the developing countries , but that the principle of equitable geographical representation should be respected , as well as the principle of the sovereign equality of States .  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
India fully supported the need for global efforts to address the whole range of refugee-related problems , including their security and protection , international solidarity and burden-sharing , supporting the capacity of host States to receive and protect refugees , seeking sustainable solutions to refugee problems within countries of origin in order to prevent new exoduses , developing durable solutions and creating conditions for the repatriation of refugees in a manner that ensured their safety and their effective reintegration .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Mr . ALMUDIR ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) , noted the wide technological and information gap which existed between developed and developing countries , and expressed the hope that global information would serve as a positive and effective tool for strengthening human relationships and promoting cultural respect , rather than for stirring up hatred and misleading public opinion through failure to present the facts . 
While for most developing countries this appears to call for increasing and qualitatively upgrading their infrastructural and human resource base , for economies in transition it would seem largely to involve new ways of using existing R &amp; amp ; D and technological potential - created for a different economic system - in a way that is more appropriate to market economies and their changing societies .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .  
Consequently , their main concerns are quite different from those of other developing countries which have already developed some industrial base but which need to improve their productivity and efficiency in order to penetrate international markets or of those developing countries which have developed competitive enterprises and significant export capacity , such as the newly industrializing countries ( NICs ) and a number of second-tier NICs , but which need to sustain their export capabilities by a process of continuous upgrading and productivity improvement .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
Considering that an expansion of technical cooperation activities relating to the peaceful uses of nuclear energy will contribute to the well-being of the peoples of the world , recognizing the special needs of the developing countries for technical assistance from the Agency and the importance of funding in order to benefit effectively from the transfer and application of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes as well as from the contribution of nuclear energy to their economic development , and desiring that the Agency 's resources for technical cooperation activities be assured and sufficient ,  
Although the special circumstances of developing countries are recognized in many specific instances throughout the revised version , there is no separate chapter or annex devoted to those circumstances ( as in the previous version ) .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Portugal 's domestic legislation provided for the criminal responsibility of legal persons , including that of the State , and there were merits in developing the concept of international criminal responsibility , but the draft articles did not include specific consequences attached to a crime as opposed to a mere wrongful act .  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
The Group of 77 and China attaches special importance to this item and considers that it should be emphasized that the subprogrammes under this programme represent an important component of United Nations technical cooperation , provided on the basis of its universal , voluntary and grant nature , to assist developing countries , especially those in Africa , and the least developed countries , in implementing international commitments derived from the conferences . 
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
His delegation in principle supported the standby arrangements and felt that developing countries , in particular , troop-contributors , should be well represented in the composition of a rapidly deployable headquarters team , which would enhance broad international support for its effective functioning .  
It looked forward to working with the Netherlands and the Russian Federation towards the development of the programme 's substantive content , and stressed the importance of developing activities to commemorate those occasions at the regional as well as the global level .  
The President of Mongolia , in his address to the General Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , had emphasized the importance of developing a set of ground rules for the pacific settlement of disputes , an idea further developed by Mongolia 's Prime Minister in his recent address to the General Assembly when he had called on the international community to elaborate the guiding principles for conducting international negotiations .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
It was paradoxical that those States which were the most vocal critics of the developing countries ' record on human rights were silent upon the subject of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The purpose was to provide graduates , sponsored by their Governments , with the opportunity to work in the field under the direction of senior experts or senior staff members of the United Nations in order to assist developing countries through the implementation of technical cooperation projects .  Over the course of time , a number of such associate experts have been assigned to functions carried out by offices at headquarters , usually in economic and social research and analysis ; those at headquarters offices are also sometimes referred to as " junior professional officers " .  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Concessional , bilateral contributions from the developed countries were crucial in that regard , as was a favourable international economic environment , characterized by improved access to markets , stable exchange rates , effectively managed international interest rates , increased resource flows and access by the developing countries to technology .  
While the developing countries bore the primary responsibility for finding solutions to their economic predicament , their development efforts should be based on genuine interdependence and mutual cooperation with the developed economies in the context of global partnership rather than on the old donor-recipient relationship .  
Other issues that must be addressed included the problems faced by developing countries , particularly those in Africa , concerning access to markets , capital and technology , unfavourable institutional arrangements and inadequate capacity for their meaningful integration into the world economy .  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
Rejects coercive extraterritorial measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women and the elderly ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments ; thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
The key factors which contribute to inefficient energy-use in the transport sector are growing road congestion in urban areas , increasing dependence on cars , and use of vehicles which are not fuel efficient coupled with poor vehicle and road maintenance in developing countries .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
In developing countries the current flows of private investment are highly concentrated on a few countries with export potential , while serious shortages of funds are experienced in countries where forestry is oriented towards domestic markets .  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
The General Assembly could not remain silent at the gross and systematic violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of the populations of developing countries caused by such measures , which were in flagrant violation of international law .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments ; thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
The coming to power of the coalition of the right-wing Likud with other extreme forces a few months ago led to the application of their declared programme , which aims at increasing Jewish immigration , consolidating , expanding , developing and increasing the number of settlements , and imposing land seizures and forceful expropriation .  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries , and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including new and concrete measures and swift implementation of innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Stresses that the evolving debt strategy must be accompanied by a favourable and supportive international economic environment , including the full implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations , and the Marrakesh ministerial decisions in favour of the least developed countries and the net food-importing developing countries ;  
Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Reaffirms also the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ; 
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular , to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
He was delighted to see that UNCTAD activities which were of importance to his country - such as assistance to developing and transitional economies in integrating into the international trade system , restrictive business practices and competition issues , trade in services , the interrelationship between trade and environment , and the impact of economic regionalization on the multilateral trade system - were duly reflected .  
Commenting on the need to assist many developing countries , especially the least developed countries , with the promotion of exports , he said the EU had taken note of the suggestion in the Trade and Development Report 1996 for establishing an international marketing and information service , but was of the view that such assistance should take place at a level as close as possible to the relevant industry and be based upon detailed understanding of export capabilities .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
While welcoming the increase in the share of technical cooperation accounted for by services infrastructure and trade efficiency , as well as the continuing positive trends in the area of global interdependence , including debt management , the African group was preoccupied by the weakening of programmes on commodities , science and technology and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
Much remained to be done to advance the cause in terms of the tasks assigned to the Commissions and expert meetings , for the main challenge ahead was to perfect a pragmatic approach that would enable the international community to deal with the development problem in a globalized world economy and to endow UNCTAD with efficient and modern instruments for helping the developing countries to meet this challenge .  
The issues of the environment and development required a global rather than a selective approach ; for the developing countries , the eradication of poverty , together with economic and social development , remained the first priorities and should be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development .  
" Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
The General Assembly , Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,

" Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;

Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
A solid scientific , technological and industrial capability accumulated in developing detection and mine-clearing equipment allows us to participate in promising international programmes in the field .  
Letter dated 20 November 1996 from the Permanent Representative of Zimbabwe to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General , transmitting a joint communiqu entitled " The current international trading system and prospects for the promotion of trade among developing countries " , released at the sixth meeting of the Summit Level Group of Developing Countries , held at Harare from 3 to 5 November 1996 ( A / C . 2 / 51 / 10 ) .  
" Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with all types of debt of a large number of developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
" Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that , owing to uneven developments within the context of the evolving international debt strategy , further progress , including new and concrete measures and innovative approaches , is essential as regards contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
At the end of the first preambular paragraph , the words " other relevant international agreements concerning international cooperation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries " were replaced with the words " the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summit meetings held since the beginning of the 1990s " ;  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance and the urgent need for the industrialized countries to substantially increase that assistance so as to reach the internationally agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance as soon as possible ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Emphasizes the importance of a favourable international and national environment for the industrialization of developing countries and urges all Governments to adopt and implement development policies and strategies that , inter alia , promote enterprise development , productive investments , technological adaptation and innovation , and expanded access to developing country markets in the context of an open , equitable , non-discriminatory , transparent and multilateral rule-based international trading system ;  
" Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island and landlocked countries ;

Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
Recognizes also the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
In addition , the Secretary-General considers that , in developing criteria for accelerated promotion called for in recommendation 1 ( h ) and paragraph 78 of the JIU report , demonstrated mobility should be among the main criteria , bearing in mind , of course , those categories or occupational groups of staff which are not expected to be mobile ( e.g . staff in the General Service and related categories ) , or for whom mobility opportunities are limited .  
For the appropriate management of high seas fisheries as well as that of the exclusive economic zones , the developed countries should transfer the necessary technology to developing countries to enable them better to conduct scientific research , handle data and pursue fisheries operations in a more responsible manner .  We now face the formidable task of implementing the comprehensive global framework of ocean management .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries domestic resources for the financing , management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
Schools , universities , professional and vocational training programmes and institutions should be encouraged and assisted in developing human rights curricula and corresponding teaching and resource materials , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes , for incorporation into formal education at the early childhood , primary , secondary , post-secondary and adult education levels .  
Appropriate institutions of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , workers ' and employers ' organizations , labour unions , the mass media , religious organizations , community organizations , the family , independent information , resource and training centres and others , for the purpose of incorporating human rights education into non-formal programmes , should be encouraged and assisted in developing and delivering such non-formal programmes , with the help of Governments and international donors and programmes .  
Each national focal point should be charged with identifying national human rights education needs , developing a national plan of action , raising funds , coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade and reporting to the High Commissioner for Human Rights on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade ;  
Following the decision of the Committee to promote international cooperation in space science and technology , the United Nations Programme on Space Applications was established with the objective , inter alia , of providing scientists from developing countries with educational programmes in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communication and basic space science .  
Because of the increasing number of developing countries that are actively engaged in space science research , the United Nations , through the Programme and the Committee , has in recent years placed increased emphasis on promoting education and research in space science and technology and , in particular , planetary exploration and astronomy ( topics covered in a guidebook3 published for International Space Year , 1992 ) , comprising what has come to be known in the international space community as basic space science .  
The increasing costs of big science projects and a changing international research atmosphere have fostered the trend in the scientific community to focus on the development of large , internationally funded facilities capable of taking advantage of the climatological and geographical attributes of any country , particularly developing countries .  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
The special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 would have a major impact on environmental conservation and preservation and required the support of both the developed and the developing countries , the United Nations system and civil society , especially non-governmental organizations and the private sector . 
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that BOT and other forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to re-allocate resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
In its resolution 1996 / 27 of 29 August 1996 , the Sub-Commission requested the Secretary-General , in accordance with Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 290 , to convene an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions and its relationship to internationally recognized human rights , with a view to developing a set of comprehensive human rights guidelines on forced evictions , and to submit the report on the seminar , together with the guidelines , to the Sub-Commission at its forty-ninth session .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
The same can be said of the pioneering efforts under way towards linking international organizations , both governmental and non-governmental , with national and private multinational banks in order to provide the funds and services which small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in transitional and developing countries require for sustainable development activities .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting public-private partnerships , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include a review of the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
Also , both the Teledesic Corporation and Sky Station International declared that they would provide some of their telecommunications capacity free of charge to developing countries , meaning several regions and countries would have free access to some of the fastest communications available for health or educational purposes .  NULLBecause of the tremendous advances in telecommunications technology , a new global community is emerging .  
The Global Conference on Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held at Bridgetown , Barbados , in 1994 , noted that small island developing States are prone to extremely damaging natural disasters , primarily in the form of severe weather , volcanic eruptions and earth-quakes ( A / CONF . 167 / 9 ) .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The instrument should be developed in such a manner as to recognize ongoing activities on persistent organic pollutants and other related issues and institutions , as well as differing regional and national conditions and taking into account the special concerns of developing countries and countries with economies in transition ;  
At its fifty-third session , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 17 , entitled " Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights " .  
The technical cooperation programme has focused on incorporating international human rights standards in national legal systems , developing policies and practices and building national capacities and regional structures for the promotion and protection of all human rights , democracy and the rule of law .  
Reaffirms the great potential of technical cooperation among developing countries , which has now gained widespread acceptance as an innovative and effective instrument of technical cooperation , and urges developing countries that have not yet done so to elaborate national policies and strategies for technical cooperation among developing countries so as to give full effect to this form of cooperation ;  
Calls upon developing , developed and other countries , their intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , as well as the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system , to give their full support to the effective implementation of the technical cooperation among developing countries framework , including support for innovative national , regional and interregional programmes and projects and the expanded utilization of the technical cooperation among developing countries modality in the operational activities for development of the United Nations system ;  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
That desire becomes even more urgent given that the boundless mind of man has produced numerous miraculous inventions , opening up a new era called the post-industrial era or the information age , while more than a quarter of the developing world 's population still lives in poverty , some 840-million go hungry or face food insecurity , and even in industrial countries more than 100-million people live below the poverty line and 37-million are jobless . 
Barbados shares the anxiety of small developing States , which are highly vulnerable to marginalization in this fiercely competitive environment given our sparse natural and human-resource base and limited administrative and technical capacity .  
The struggle of developing countries to eradicate poverty , achieve economic and social progress and attain conditions of sustained economic growth and sustainable development has as a prerequisite sine qua non the establishment of a more propitious and dynamic economic environment .  
Two years ago , during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we committed ourselves not only to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , but also to rededicate our efforts to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness for our universal Organization , with a view to enabling it to play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable development , particularly in the developing countries .  
Cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU requires for its continued success an effective , vibrant , modern and reformed United Nations , responsive to the concerns of the vast majority of its Members , the developing countries .  
The task of developing a culture of peace would require comprehensive educational , cultural , social and civic action based on a commonality of interest and shared goals .  
A culture of peace will contribute to international cooperation for economic and social development and sustained economic growth in the developing countries of our world and permit the billions of dollars spent each year on armaments of death and mass destruction to be directed towards eradicating poverty , facilitating human development and making our world a better place to live in for all , developed and developing countries alike .  
The Agency justifiably has a strong reputation for generating ideas and initiating practical actions aimed at enhancing nuclear safety and security by undertaking the dual functions of strengthening the international non-proliferation regime and developing peaceful cooperation in the use of atomic energy .  
Despite the negative public perception created in some countries and the fears aroused about the dangers of nuclear proliferation , nuclear energy remains a viable and attractive energy option for many countries , and particularly for the fossil fuel-deficient developing countries .  
I have already stated that the United Nations must play a constructive and catalytic role , within its macroeconomic policies to facilitate economic growth for sustained development , thereby enabling developing countries , which constitute the vast majority of the Members of the Organization , to have an equal share in the opportunities for wealth creation .  
In fact , we are aware and convinced that merely meeting the requirements of the ritual of holding periodic elections is not enough and can in no way be considered decisive in establishing and guaranteeing lasting democracy in a country , particularly in a developing country such as my own , which is classified among the least developed .  
It has paid special attention to external humanitarian assistance issues and has provided unparalleled assistance to many developing countries , particularly those which have suffered natural disasters and civil and regional wars .  
The United Arab Emirates pins great hopes on international development assistance in support of plans for the establishment of national Palestinian institutions and for developing the local technical capacities of the Palestinian people in order to enable it to implement its economic and social development plans with a view to its proper integration into international trade .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
Contributing to the widening economic and social gap between the developed and the developing States , these phenomena in no way help to further the aspirations of the peoples of the world to a new international economic order that is both equitable and just and that could serve as a solid and reliable foundation for peace , security , stability and development throughout the world .  
Regional and international arms races and military expenditure do not merely threaten international peace and security and the stability of States ; they also absorb tremendous amounts of national economic and financial resources , particularly in the developing countries that so sorely need those resources to achieve their aspirations to economic and social development .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
We are here to consolidate our collective efforts and to concentrate on developing a more pragmatic and mutually beneficial relationship so that in the years ahead we are better able to tackle the problems we have already identified at previous conferences and at the national level .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .  
While we recognized that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations , it was also recognized that meeting the environmental objectives in Agenda 21 would place additional , even onerous , burdens on developing countries .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Strengthened international cooperation and the application of appropriate national policy will also contribute to ensuring a stable environment conducive to promoting social development , including reduction of unemployment and generation of productive employment in developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
In most developing countries , the formal sector is incapable of providing a sufficient number of jobs to meet existing and future projected requirements .  
A useful model for developing improved partnerships with non-governmental organizations is the PARinAC initiative of UNHCR , which emphasizes the formulation of common principles and goals and the creation of an umbrella framework for action and extensive consultative processes involving non-governmental organizations at the country , regional and international levels .  
While proximity to the countries is a definite advantage in developing geographical specialization - something difficult to achieve by entities outside the region - the marked heterogeneity among the countries of the ESCAP region calls for special skills , localized knowledge , and competence for adopting , whenever required , a case-by-case approach .  
In the context of reform of the United Nations in general and of the regional commissions in particular , the role of statistics divisions should be enhanced towards more efficient monitoring of progress in global and regional developments , as well as towards assisting the national statistical organizations of developing countries to become more responsive to national and international needs for timely and efficient statistics .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
In this sense , international cooperation , including financial and technical support , is a duty of States in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic and industrialized countries are encouraged to act in a spirit of solidarity in assisting developing countries to meet the challenges of implementing the Guidelines .  
A partnership for development should be forged in which developed and developing countries would undertake , in a framework of growing interdependence and joint responsibility , to establish sensible national policies and an international climate conducive to sustainable and accelerated development .  
A working group or other mechanism should be set up to examine the imbalance in decision-making powers between developed and developing countries and between major and smaller nations in decision-making in global issues ( political , economic and social and cultural ) and institutions , such as the Bretton Woods institutions , the World Trade Organization , the Security Council and other United Nations bodies . 
Many independent experts and NGOs have also identified the structural adjustment policy package as a major cause of the deepening of poverty and deterioration in social and living conditions in many developing countries in the past two decades .  
And as the proportion of those over age 60 changes from approximately 1 in 14 to 1 in 4 ( sooner in developed countries but faster in developing countries ) , the interrelationship of ageing and development will become evident in economic , social , political and cultural areas . 
In the fourth review and appraisal , representatives of non-governmental organizations have been included in 31 ( 72 per cent ) of the national coordinating mechanisms : 48 per cent in developed countries , and 62 per cent in developing countries , a slightly higher level than that reported in 1992 .  
About one quarter of the Governments , including 33 per cent of the developed and 21 per cent of the developing countries , have produced national directories of public and private organizations concerned with ageing and / or services and opportunities for the aged . 
Small island developing States possess unique characteristics , including fragile ecosystems , small land area and limited natural resources , which make them significantly more vulnerable to environmental degradation and human health problems resulting from inadequate management of wastes .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
For the present report , data were sought through UNFPA 's network of offices in the developing countries via a concise questionnaire , realizing that , given the small size of UNFPA field offices and the fact that field offices do not have a data-collection function as part of their regular responsibilities , the data gathered would be preliminary and fragmentary in nature .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
Given the rates of urbanization in developing countries and subsequent new needs for services and infrastructure in human settlements , it is somewhat alarming to note that not much progress has been made on developing new mechanisms for sustained financing , on the scale required for the building , operating and maintaining of basic services and infrastructure ( see table ) . 
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
The ban on the export of hazardous products , including those intended for recycling , which has now been imposed by the Basel Convention would remain a dead letter if it were not accompanied by practical measures for the detection of illicit practices .  This can be achieved only by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries .  
Various factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature are contributing to the illicit traffic , transfer and dumping of toxic and dangerous wastes and products in African and other developing countries ( see the preliminary report of the Special Rapporteur , E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 17 , paras . 103 _ 115 , 149 and 150 ) . 
In this regard , the promulgation of strict legislation to control transboundary movements of dangerous wastes should be continued and , in particular , encouraged in the developing countries in order to reduce the discrepancies between the national legal norms applied in the developed and the developing countries .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Also recognizing the critical problems common to human settlements in the developing countries , including poverty , unemployment , social disintegration , inadequate shelter and lack of proper maintenance of urban and rural infrastructure and services ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Also reaffirms the agreement on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and notes with interest the consensus reached at Oslo on 25 April 1996 on this matter ;  
Urges the international community to reduce , as appropriate , excessive military expenditures on and investments in arms production and acquisition , consistent with national security requirements , in order to increase resources for social and economic development , in particular to poverty eradication programmes in developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Emphasizing once again the urgent need for concrete measures to reduce the vulnerability of societies to natural hazards , the loss of human lives and the heavy physical and economic damage that occur as a result of natural disasters , in particular in developing countries , small island developing States and landlocked countries ,  
Reaffirms the need to support the implementation of the Yokohama Strategy and its Plan of Action with particular regard to improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , for the purpose of capacity-building and human resources development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , as well as least developed , small island developing and landlocked countries ;  
This involves improving competitiveness in telecommunications , continuing with the technological development of Earth observation , developing advanced scientific instrumentation , carrying out work in orbital infrastructures and acquiring techniques for future launchers .  
In the case of small island developing States , as for developing countries as a whole , the percentage of bilateral and multilateral commitments of ODA has risen for environmental protection and natural resource management and for basic social services ( see tables 7 and 8 ) .  
Taking into consideration the overall needs of the country , the expected core resources of the United Nations agencies and the unique operating environment , the United Nations , together with non-governmental organizations spent the latter half of 1996 developing a joint strategy for efficient and targeted assistance in four main areas : emergencies , reintegration , rehabilitation and governance .  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
Recognizing that , while developing countries have primary responsibility for their own development , there is continuing need for the international community to give strong support to their efforts to solve their economic and social problems through , inter alia , the promotion of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Noting also that the future course of net transfer of resources to developing countries depends on a growth-oriented and supportive international economic environment and on sound domestic economic policies ,  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Reaffirms the pressing need of developing countries for official development assistance , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , and urges countries to strive to fulfil , consistent with commitments in international agreements , the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries for official development assistance to the developing countries , and the target , where agreed , of 0.15 per cent of the gross national product of the developed countries for official development assistance to the least developed countries as soon as possible ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization in developed and developing countries , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Also recognizes the contribution to the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children of the mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of national budgets to basic social programmes ;  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
While welcoming the existence of government bodies competent to deal with the welfare of children at the national level , the Committee expresses its concern at the insufficient coordination between these bodies as well as between national and local bodies in developing a comprehensive approach to the implementation of the Convention .  
Recommendations to address these constraints included : ( a ) identifying promotional messages for SHD to be used by all staff in contacts with the media at seminars and other venues ; ( b ) improving links between the staff working in policy , substantive and operational matters and those in media ; ( c ) encouraging all staff to invest time in developing and communicating clear messages on the role and activities of UNDP ; and ( d ) allocating increased funding from the organizational budget for communication and advocacy efforts .  
It serves as an expert facility and repository of technical information relating to the sustainable development of small hydropower operations as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy , particularly in rural areas of developing countries .  
The Philippines - as expressed in previous comments - favoured the draft minimum rules and stated that the Department of Justice of the Philippines was developing several activities intended to improve the capabilities of prosecutors and enhance the working relations among law enforcers and trial court judges , in order to fulfil the desired goals set by the draft minimum rules .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
Observing scientifically the changes in the international situation , Mr . Deng Xiaoping led us in the reshaping of an international strategy adhering to an independent foreign policy of peace , safeguarding world peace , promoting world development and opposing hegemonism and power politics , thus opening up a new situation in China 's relations with foreign countries in a new era , and making historic contributions to developing and strengthening China 's friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence .  
The central collective leadership , with President Jiang Zemin at its core , will lead the Chinese people in carrying forward the behest of Mr . Deng Xiaoping , advancing the great cause pioneered by him : building China into a prosperous , democratic and civilized socialist country , and developing friendly relations of cooperation with all countries in the world , thus making more , and greater , contributions to peace , development and the progress of mankind .  
The arming of Armenia on such a large scale and the sharp build-up of its military might in violation of international legal norms , at a time when relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation are improving and steadily developing , poses a real threat to the entire region .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
The ultimate objective of BITs from the point of view of developing host countries is to contribute to a favourable investment climate , with a view to attracting more FDI flows and , ultimately , advancing the economic and social development of the host countries involved .  
WWhat are the lessons to be learned from BITs as regards increasing the quantity and quality of investment flows and advancing sustainable social and economic development in host developing countries ? 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Even though there was no specific mention to this effect in the response received from the Netherlands , it is known that the country , along with other developed countries , such as Japan , participates in triangular arrangements , whereby the services of suitable developing countries are utilized to deliver a technical cooperation input to another developing country .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development , and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and highly _ indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Emphasizes the need for new flows of financial resources to the indebted developing countries , and urges the creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase financial assistance on favourable terms as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty , and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the Geostationary Satellite Orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
The resolution provides that consultative relations may be established with international , regional , subregional and national organizations , and that the Council , in considering applications for consultative status , should ensure , to the extent possible , participation of non-governmental organizations from all regions , and particularly from developing countries , in order to help achieve a just , balanced , effective and genuine involvement of non-governmental organizations from all regions and areas of the world ( para .  5 ) .  
The view was expressed that in view of the special characteristics of the geostationary orbit , there was a need to establish a sui generis legal regime for regulating access to and use of that orbit , which was a limited natural resource , and that such a regime should guarantee actual and future equitable access to the geostationary orbit for all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , including the equatorial countries , because of their special geographical characteristics .  
The view was expressed that reference to practical problems in the implementation of equitable access to the geostationary satellite orbit presupposed that there were no prior legal problems in the implementation of equitable access , particularly for the developing countries .  
Aware that equitable access to and efficient use of the geostationary satellite orbit / radio frequency spectrum resources for all States or groups of States , taking into account the special needs of the developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries , is of fundamental importance to the development of telecommunications infrastructure for economic , social and cultural development of all States ,  
Recognizes that institutions responsible for sustaining the rule of law play an important role in removing the causes of mass exoduses and , in this context , calls on the High Commissioner to continue his efforts , at the request of the Governments concerned , to reinforce national legal , judicial and administrative capacity , including training opportunities through technical cooperation programmes in countries of origin as well as host countries , particularly developing countries ;  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
An important dimension implicit in regional and subregional operational activities , that of the practice and potential for technical cooperation among developing countries , needs to be made more explicit so that more opportunities for such cooperation can be exploited .  
The Commission on Human Rights , at its fifty-second session , in its decision 1996 / 104 , decided to recommend to the Economic and Social Council , in the light of the conclusions of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) , to be held in Istanbul in June 1996 , to authorize the holding of an expert seminar on the practice of forced evictions with a view to developing comprehensive human rights guidelines on development-based displacement .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
The deferral of two expert group meetings , one on the macroeconomic effects of drug trafficking in selected developing countries and economies in transition and the other on new forms of international cooperation in law enforcement with particular reference to the problems of transit States , has affected the level of understanding of drug trafficking patterns in the geographic areas in question . 
Review the implementation and effectiveness of the programme of work of the secretariat , and make recommendations to the Commission about future programmes of work , and in this process ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked and Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development , socially and economically disadvantaged groups and women in development are adequately addressed .  
Work closely with other subsidiary organs of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , coordinate activities with them , and ensure that cross-sectoral issues such as the special concerns of the least developed , landlocked , Pacific island developing countries and economies in transition , the environment , human resources development and women in development are adequately addressed .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the least developed and landlocked developing countries have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade and other international declarations .  
The special problems and constraints on the economic and social development of the Pacific island developing countries related to their isolation , small size and vulnerability to environmental hazards have been recognized by the international community , and also within the context of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and other international declarations .  
Convinced that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic , social and related fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of its subsidiary bodies located in the developing regions ,  
Nevertheless , these decisive changes did not come about easily and had to make their way within an extremely hostile international setting marked by the cold war , and at a time when the so _ called national security doctrine was becoming established in many developing countries and across virtually the whole of the American continent .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Noting that much of the environmental degradation results from unsustainable lifestyles in the industrialized world or poverty and underdevelopment in developing countries , which itself is the result of inequitable growth patterns , unfavourable terms of trade and investment flows , and a global macroeconomic environment that is not supportive of the development of developing countries ,  
Stress that no discriminatory environmental instrument or agreement should be enforced regarding elimination of persistent organic pollutants in the absence of viable inputs vital for sustained increase in food production in all developing countries , including the SAARC countries , and that all efforts should be made to provide alternative chemicals and technology for production of these alternatives on non-commercial terms to enable developing countries to phase out the elimination of such persistent organic pollutants ;  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The Secretariat will further be required to assist developing country Parties , on request , particularly those in Africa , in the preparation of their national , subregional and regional communications ; to analyze , collate and present those communications so as to facilitate their consideration by the COP ; to facilitate the consultative and coordination processes as set out in the relevant regional implementation annexes ; to ensure coordination with the secretariats of other relevant bodies ; and to assist in promoting public awareness of the Convention to Combat Desertification ( CCD ) .  
We thank the UNCTAD secretariat for having convened this Expert Meeting , as well as for the preparatory work and the documentation , all of which is contributing to a more profound analysis of trade in relation to health services - an area in which many countries , largely developing countries like Cuba , are striving to become competitive in an international market dominated to all intents and purposes by the large transnational corporations . 
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
Many States have successfully implemented comparatively rapid procedures at points of entry which ensure a fair and competent assessment of the need for international protection , and UNHCR encourages States to ensure the rights of the individual through proper legal safeguards , in developing such procedures .  
The contribution which foreign direct investment can make to development is widely recognized , including as a source of capital as well as of managerial , technical and marketing know-how necessary for the development of new and viable manufacturing , services and resource-based industries in developing countries .  
The transfer of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies to developing countries relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms . "  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
As for trade statistics , the mission focused attention on : ( i ) ascertaining the technical capabilities and work plan of the PCBS with regard to the compilation , processing , analysis , and dissemination of Palestinian foreign trade statistics ; ( ii ) identifying the nature and extent of needs of the PCBS for technical assistance in the area of international trade statistics ; and , ( iii ) developing relevant proposals for manpower training .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
In normal circumstances , growing developing countries should see their external debt rising , reflecting foreign borrowing to supplement domestic resources for investment .  
To support efforts aimed at prevention , UNDCP has continued to collaborate with Member States in developing a declaration on the principles of reduction of illicit demand for drugs , to be considered for adoption at the special session of the General Assembly devoted to the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , to be held from 8 to 10 June 1998 .  
Many Governments have emphasized the paramount importance of regional meetings of subsidiary bodies of the Commission , which coordinate the efforts of developing countries in drug law enforcement and provide the only means of establishing and strengthening the mutual trust and confidence that are essential , in view of the limited resources of the countries concerned , to effective cooperation in and coordination of drug law enforcement operations at the regional level . 
Considers that if the geographical dynamics of international migratory movements are steadily increasing , it is because poverty is growing in a large number of developing countries and the use of foreign labour in the developed countries is continuing despite claims that there is a crisis ;  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
It had also urged all countries , particularly the developed countries , to strengthen their efforts to create a more favourable international economic environment , in particular a more open agricultural trading system which would stimulate food production and productivity in developing countries , and in that context had stressed the importance of the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Final Act of the Uruguay Round . 50 .  The world currently had the ability to produce enough food for all of humanity .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
The draft resolution was essentially a procedural document dealing with institutional links between the United Nations and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the necessary financial support , but listed in its preambular part the main events that had occurred during the year pursuant to the Convention , which was of crucial importance to many developing countries . 
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
The terms active or productive ageing are currently used in two ways : first , to describe , and thereby to support , the importance of the many socially and economically productive roles open to ageing individuals in developing countries and , secondly , as an attempt to reverse the phenomenon in developed countries whereby retirement from the formal economic sector automatically negates the formal acknowledgment of the unpaid productive roles of many older persons . 
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
In order to eliminate the causes of the refugee problem , it was necessary to establish a new international political and economic order based on increased international cooperation to promote progress and development in the developing countries , the peaceful settlement of disputes , respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of States . 
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , official development assistance remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
The granting of preferential access to external markets , through bilateral , regional and international agreements , would greatly enhance the investment promotion efforts of developing countries , particularly smaller economies , as a minimum market size is an important prerequisite for many investors .  
In its resolution 50 / 119 of 20 December 1995 , entitled Economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and a United Nations conference on South-South cooperation , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to present to it on a biennial basis a report entitled State of South-South cooperation containing a comprehensive overview and analysis of South-South economic and technical cooperation worldwide and international support in that regard , including quantitative data and indicators on all aspects of South-South cooperation .  
For developing countries , the primary motivation is the formation and consolidation of viable economic spaces that would create dynamic trade and investment growth , develop viable , integrated and competitive productive systems to serve regional and international markets , strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination and enhance infrastructural linkages .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
With investment in the last decade having risen faster than both trade and gross domestic product , and with continued impetus from expected further liberalization of portfolio and long-term capital flows in the future , the promotion of South-South cooperation desired by developing countries may include greater emphasis on the role of investment within the context of an integrated intra-South production framework . 
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
That training is implemented in cooperation with the five education development centres , one in each Field , and covers a wide range of courses of one - , two - or three-year duration aimed at certifying unqualified elementary and preparatory teachers or vocational training instructors , meeting curricular changes and developing the supervisory and leadership skills of senior education staff .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
With its unique nature , its special mandate and its open-ended composition it could contribute greatly to the process of restructuring the Organization , giving an enhanced role to the General Assembly as the most representative body and increasing the representativeness of the Security Council by expanding the participation of developing countries , in conformity with the principle of sovereign equality as well as equitable geographical representation .  
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; those countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
However , foreign direct investment in developing countries , as well as the recent parallel surge in international portfolio investment , has been concentrated in the more advanced economies , the larger economies and those with high rates of economic growth .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in science and technology of developing countries , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The need for an integrated and intersectoral approach to health strategies has been recognized , as well as the importance of strengthening national and international efforts to prevent and combat epidemics and other diseases that are endemic in many developing countries , and in particular to address malaria and the spread of human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) more effectively .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
The Seventh United Nations International Training Course on Remote Sensing Education for Educators , held at Stockholm and Kiruna , Sweden , from 5 May to 13 June 1997 , was organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Application in cooperation with the Government of Sweden . The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce remote sensing courses in their respective academic institutions .  
While such savings now represented a greater proportion of the gross domestic product of developing countries than they had a decade earlier , savings rates in Africa and Latin America remained comparatively low , owing to low absolute levels of per capita income in Africa , the low rates of growth in income , continuing high levels of unemployment in both regions and patterns of income distribution .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
While the formulation of common standards for prudential oversight and management of risk situations and efforts to involve developing countries and countries with transition economies were welcome , States remained responsible for the establishment of a stable and predictable national environment for foreign investment .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
His delegation hoped that appropriate measures would be taken at the national and international levels to ensure that the benefits of foreign direct investment were shared by as many developing countries as possible , since such investment played a critical role not only in terms of capital flow but also served as a channel for the transfer of technology and improved access to international export markets .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
Donor countries should muster their political will in support of development assistance , which would help to foster a stable strategic partnership between developed and developing countries in an increasingly interdependent global economy .  
The Cambodia Office continued to benefit from the generous support of UNDP in several areas of its work , including the provision of legal advice to the National Assembly , supporting the National Assembly Commission on Human Rights and Reception of Complaints , provision of training for provincial judges and court staff , assisting the Government in developing forensic capability , and provision of training to police , commune leaders and military officers at the provincial level .  
Given that the five Central Asian Republics are landlocked , in search of world markets and in need of developing new transport corridors to improve trade performance , UNDP is providing support to the Government of Tajikistan to pave the way for a modern system of transit procedures and ensure adherence to international customs conventions that simplify border crossings among the five Central Asian Countries , resulting in reduced transport costs , increased competitiveness , expanded trade potential and augmented economic growth .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .  
Throughout the session , intensive consultations , both formal and informal , were held under the authority of the successive Presidents with a view to clarifying positions and developing a minimum common ground which would allow the Conference to discharge its mandate as the sole multilateral negotiating forum of the international community in the field of disarmament .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Poverty and the persistence and worsening imbalances that divide the world between developed countries , developing countries , least developed countries and poor , heavily indebted countries , are tension-creating factors that hinder the realization of a real and lasting peace .  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly those of sending and receiving countries , to strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , including by developing strategies and joint action , and taking into account innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
Despite their economic limitations , the developing countries had made strenuous efforts to achieve the objectives of the Programme , and in particular to integrate more fully demographic changes and the development processes , since population programmes were accepted as a fundamental component of any viable strategy for sustainable economic and social development .  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
As many here are aware , it is this objective which has led to Canada and others developing a comprehensive programme for Ottawa this December , when other practical measures will be further elaborated in such fields as demining , victim assistance and social and economic rehabilitation .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
Other organizations interested in the process , such as governments , trade unions , industrial sectors , TNCs and other NGOs , should contribute and cooperate with each other to disseminate , as widely and as homogenously as possible , basic information on EMS in order to guarantee a common ground for achieving the opportunities for a fair development of worldwide trade and avoid negative effects that may arise from an inadequate implementation of EMS in developing countries .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Reiterates the need to continue trade liberalization in areas of export interest to developing countries , including through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
A number of speakers pointed to the continuing importance of a new world information and communication order , based on a free and balanced flow of information , in a world where disparities in technological advances were widespread and the gap between the developed and developing countries was ever-widening .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

In view of potential as well as proved advantages of the use of advanced technologies , including electronic publishing , the increased use of such technologies for the publishing process should be enhanced by the Secretariat and a general shift towards the various forms of electronic publishing should be intensified and due regard paid to cost recovery and access to such electronic products in developing countries .  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
It was emphasized that the original raison d \ x { 76bb } re of trade preferences in providing developing countries with preferred market access to their major markets is even more relevant in the present world of heightened global competition juxtaposed with continuing supply-side difficulties in developing countries .  
It was suggested that further examination may be required of the principle of special and differential treatment for developing countries in the light of the evolving changes relating inter alia to trade preferences , emergence of regional free trade areas between developed and developing countries based on reciprocity , and the interrelationships between these free trade areas and future multilateral trade liberalization .  
It was suggested that such opportunities may be found in the sectors where developing countries have ( i ) natural and geographical advantages ; ( ii ) an education and training basis to provide skilled workers ; ( iii ) the competitive advantage provided by lower wages ; and ( iv ) the possibility to cut the cost of services further , utilizing the communication and transport technology .  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
The key role of the United Nations , which is central to the process , is therefore one of providing expert assistance , drawing on the extensive experience of the international community in developing and implementing such integrated humanitarian mine-action programmes .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts , including bilateral cooperation , in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 , within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building of developing countries in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , the increased access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology and full and equal participation in decision-making ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ;  
Reaffirming also that South-South cooperation constitutes an important element of international cooperation for development and is an essential basis for national and collective self-reliance as well as a means of ensuring the effective integration and participation of developing countries in the world economy and that it is not a substitute for , but rather complementary to , North-South cooperation ,  
Taking note also of the Declaration adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their twenty-first annual meeting , [ 3 ] held in New York on 26 September 1997 , in which the Ministers emphasized the increasing importance and complementarity of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries as a means of supporting and broadening the global partnership in international development cooperation ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Urges the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , and invites other relevant intergovernmental organizations involved in international development cooperation , to make concerted and vigorous efforts to mainstream the implementation of modalities of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries by giving them full consideration in the design , formulation , implementation and evaluation of programmes and projects in their operational activities ;  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
Indeed , with all of these trends and tendencies in the world economy , it was recognized by both developed and developing countries , States Members of the United Nations , that it was imperative to launch an endeavour of charting a framework of objectives and measures for national and international actions to address development more squarely and comprehensively than any other previous initiative undertaken by the United Nations .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
We have realized that all the major political , economic , social and cultural problems of the world can be tackled meaningfully when development is fully addressed by developed and developing countries alike , as guided by the Agenda for Development .  
In this respect , we stress the need to foster technical cooperation in this field on the broadest possible basis , both to develop economical , safe techniques for mine detection and removal and to provide access to such techniques by those requiring them , with a view to developing international cooperation to mitigate the suffering of those who have fallen victim to the random and indiscriminate use of such mines , and who must be rehabilitated and fully reintegrated into society .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that various forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to reallocate the resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
Some other delegations considered the draft declaration to be a relevant , realistic and timely proposal , reflecting the need for consolidating and developing a proper legal basis and procedures for peacekeeping , preventive and other relevant operations of the United Nations .  
He stated that with the apparent weakening of the commitment to development cooperation on the part of the traditional partners , TCDC and South-South cooperation represented the best hope for the developing countries in the context of the emerging global order , although it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional development cooperation .  
Barbados is improving living conditions by revitalizing the main town centres , developing systems of physical planning and coastal management , and promoting partnerships between the public and private sector , disposing of waste and extending water resources .  
The country has achieved a considerable improvement in housing conditions , both in terms of living space and standard of dwellings , but is now placing a special emphasis on increasing the production of rental and cooperative housing , increased renovation of existing housing , developing the housing finance system and promoting the stability of the market for rental housing .  
To address the situation , the Government is planning a number of measures , which include reviewing the distribution of responsibilities in housing affairs in the public sector ; limiting public agencies ' construction activities to essential needs ; developing a viable approach to improving the housing conditions of low income citizens ; and mobilizing private capital into housing . 
An increasing number of countries are addressing the key issues of land supply , security of tenure and housing finance but , at the global level , action is still limited .  167 .  Many developing countries are unable to devote the necessary resources for the provision of infrastructure to improve existing settlements and also to open up new lands for housing development .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
This will be possible only if the Organization becomes better able to fulfil its basic tasks the maintenance of international peace and security and comprehensive economic and social development , particularly in developing countries and to ensure broad respect for the promotion and protection of individual and collective human rights . 
Many a representative has drawn attention to the continued and widespread growth of the global economy as we move towards the close of the century and to the broadening of the reach of economic growth in developing countries to include an increasing number of low-income countries .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
We firmly believe that the aims of any reform designed to restructure the Organization and rationalize its expenditures can be attained only if due account is taken of the interests of the developing countries and , above all , if reform provides for a solution to their economic and social problems as well as the provision of material and technical means required for these ends .  
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
Such rampant speculation or manipulation of hedge funds in the currency and equity markets of developing countries , at a time when they are still feeling their way in a world of fierce global competition , would trigger off a defensive reflex on the part of the affected countries , thereby arousing anti-liberalization , which would be detrimental to free trade .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
The role of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and the regional commissions in examining the issues pertinent to globalization and development and the effective integration of developing countries into the international trading system is especially key , for the recent negative rulings by the World Trade Organization on the European Union banana regime , which secured access for African , Caribbean and Pacific countries , fully demonstrate the dangers inherent in unbridled liberalization shorn of consideration for the special needs of small , vulnerable and disadvantaged economies . 
Preferential access regimes represented , rather , a real and sincere effort to enable small developing countries to produce for the international marketplace , to offer their societies a chance at a decent standard of living and to assure them a special stake in the global economy .  
The Lao People 's Democratic Republic is pleased at its adoption , which it regards as an important stage in the effort to build a real partnership between the developed and developing countries .  The Agenda for Development , a highly valuable document , provides a foundation of principles , objectives , measures and actions which can serve as a guide to Member States in the global approach to development questions in the immediate and long term and at the national and international levels .  
We are fully aware that at the level of the United Nations , there have been a number of initiatives designed to help address the economic and social problems faced by developing countries and to mitigate the effects of poverty and the impact of those conditions hindering the realization of sustainable economic development .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
As a least developed country itself , the Republic of Yemen expresses its concern regarding some indications in the report that the United Nations role in the field of development may be reduced and its responsibilities limited in the field of social justice and the task of narrowing the huge gap that separates the developing and developed industrialized countries all on the pretext that some of these responsibilities have been shifted elsewhere . 
Any move in this direction is bound to encourage certain dangerous phenomena that we have been witnessing of late , including legal and illegal emigration from developing to developed countries , that could sow the seeds of social , ethnic and cultural conflict . 
As it was agreed that for most developing countries official development assistance is still a main source of external development financing and can not generally be replaced by private capital inflows , I should like to urge the donor community to intensify efforts to reverse the declining trend in official development assistance as we experience it today .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
Nonetheless , it must be explicitly stated that , in Grenada 's view , the Uruguay Round Agreements have created for small developing States significantly more burdens than the benefits they are proclaimed to bring under the banner of global free trade at least now , and for the foreseeable future , unless corrective measures are soon instituted .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
It is disturbing to note , though , that while efforts are being made to develop such provisions , developing countries are still faced with major problems of external debt and debt-servicing , marginalization in the context of globalization of the world economy and problems of developed countries not fulfilling their commitments in achieving internationally agreed official development assistance targets .  
To achieve the objectives set at the Summit , we maintain that : , first , developed countries should , at an early date fulfil their obligations to contribute 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to official development assistance and take more concrete measures for developing countries in terms of economic assistance , technological cooperation and the reduction and cancellation of debt .  
As regards debt , a genuine obstacle to development for many countries of the South , my delegation supports any initiative aimed at finding effective , fair , lasting and development-oriented solutions to the problem of foreign debt and debt-servicing faced by the developing countries .  
In concluding , let me say that while Indonesia will continue to make comprehensive efforts at the national level to translate the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development into genuine social progress , we will also continue vigorously to advocate a fair and equitable position for the developing countries within the international community .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
The fundamental question we need to ask is whether these globally defined priorities lie purely within the domain of national corrective action or whether there is a greater role for international cooperation in mobilizing the requisite political will and external resources to complement , in a commensurate manner , the considerable ongoing efforts by developing countries through their own initiatives at the national level . 
We are confident that the Secretary-General will ensure the continuing institutional capacity of the Organization to respond adequately to the needs of States , newly established institutions and other competent international organizations by providing advice and assistance , taking into account the special needs of developing countries .  
I can not conclude this brief statement without drawing attention to the equally deplorable activities of some industrialized States , which dump toxic and hazardous wastes , especially in the waters of developing States , or carry out other forms of pollution through the deliberate discharge of pollutants such as oil and oily wastes , noxious liquids or solids , and sewage or garbage .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
It is in this context that Central America is developing a complex and lasting network of reciprocal cooperation for development which includes extensive and ambitious projects such as the privatization of public enterprises or the implementation of reforms intended to make its production systems more flexible , as well as the concerted decision to boost competitiveness and take measures to preserve and support its institutions .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
To most developing countries , the sustainable development approach , as emphasized by most of our developed partners , is considered restrictive , limiting economic growth to social development and protection of the environment .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
I am especially pleased that the General Assembly has elected to this very responsible function a very competent representative from Ukraine , a friendly country with which the Republic of Macedonia is developing successful cooperation .  
In this context , we would like to emphasize the need for universal adherence to the NPT and for the signing of legally binding conventions to secure the non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or the threat of use of nuclear weapons , as well as to ban fissile materials and to end restrictions on the transfer of nuclear technology , material and equipment for peaceful purposes , which the developing countries need .  
The differing provisions of each treaty may make the creation of formal legal linkages complex and difficult , but we see scope for developing political links between the four existing or potential nuclear-weapon-free zones .  
In discussing its terms of reference , Committee members attached particular importance to ( a ) assessing world development trends and prospects ; ( b ) identifying national and international policies that would enhance the ability of developing countries and economies in transition to participate effectively in a globalizing world economy and achieve the goals agreed at United Nations global conferences ; and ( c ) undertaking periodic reviews of the list of least developed countries and the criteria used for identifying them .  
The Committee agreed to examine the following issues related to the impact of globalization on development : ( a ) globalization trends in trade , capital flows and technology transfer ; ( b ) factors leading to a homogeneous policy regime and its implications for development ; ( c ) implications of globalization for the international economy and international governance ; ( d ) recommendations for national policies , institutions and governance in developing countries ; ( e ) recommendations for policies in developed countries ; and ( f ) recommendations for policies of international organizations .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
Globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change have been accompanied by increasing economic inequality , poverty , unemployment and environmental degradation in many countries , both developed and developing .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
The expansion of global communications , travel and cultural exchange is leading to increasing demands in developing countries for the high material standards of living of the developed countries .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
While the proportion of people in absolute poverty may have been reduced as a result of rapid economic growth in some very large low-income developing countries ( notably China and India ) , the process of globalization has been accompanied by an increasing economic gap between the high and middle-income countries and the least developed countries . 
A major trend in both developed and developing countries has been increasing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers , due both to technological change and to increased trade and capital flows .  
The constraints on tax administration in developing countries include insufficient skilled personnel , inadequate equipment , problems of supervision and motivation of public sector employees , inadequately defined or overly complex tax rates , difficulty in identifying taxpayers and in punishing tax evaders , and inadequate accounting practices .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Economic , social and political stability , including stable macroeconomic policies , have been a major factor in encouraging domestic savings and investment and attracting FDI in the more successful developing countries .  
In view of the increasing importance of trade and international investment as engines of growth , developed countries must provide comprehensive support , including macroeconomic support , to the efforts of developing countries , as agreed at various OECD ministerial meetings and the summits convened by the seven major industrial countries .  
Developed countries should sustain stable economic growth at home and provide increased opportunities for developing countries to expand their exports , including both manufactured products from more advanced developing countries and primary commodities from less developed countries .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries . 
The Committee agreed that the independence and extensive experience of its members in a wide range of development-related fields provided it with a comparative advantage as a forum for the discussion and review of emerging development issues facing developing countries , particularly where such issues were cross-sectoral or cut across the responsibilities of various international bodies or agencies .  
Convinced further that it is essential for the United Nations , in carrying out activities in the economic and social fields , to take account of the regional dimension and the decentralization of tasks in accordance with the comparative advantages of Headquarters and the subsidiary organs located in the developing regions ,  
This reflects growth impulses from recovery from recession in developed countries ( even if sometimes halting ) , greater capacity to act on growth impulses in some transition economies and , for the developing countries , incentives from higher international commodity prices in recent years , as well as the strong growth of international trade and burgeoning international capital flows in the middle 1990s , not to mention better weather in Africa in 1996 .  Barring unforseen shocks , 116 countries are forecast to achieve this minimal benchmark of rising per capita output in 1997 .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
The main activities are aimed at , inter alia , raising public awareness , improving understanding of money-laundering , promoting the adoption of relevant legislation , improving law enforcement capacities to combat money-laundering , training and developing infrastructure for the implementation of an effective money-laundering strategy .  
Decides to establish an Ad Hoc Committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies or of the International Atomic Energy Agency , to elaborate an international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings and , subsequently , an international convention for the suppression of acts of nuclear terrorism , to supplement related existing international instruments , and thereafter to address means of further developing a comprehensive legal framework of conventions dealing with international terrorism ;  
As a follow-up to its expert group meeting on the role of governmental and non-governmental sectors in developing and implementing practical strategies on ageing in countries in change and transition , the United Nations programme on ageing prepared a technical publication entitled " Older persons in European countries in transition from the centrally planned economies : designing a policy response " .  
New sets of demands on families and new issues for Governments to address are being created by rapid but uneven changes in economic and demographic trends , such as an increasing number of single-parent households ( largely headed by women ) ; increasing incidence of first marriages at a later age but also a surge in teenage pregnancy ; a decreasing number of children in families ; longer life expectancy and increasing population of elderly family members ; a predominantly young population in developing countries ; and growing participation of women in the labour market .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
The potential danger posed by the frequent passage of commercial vessels , and on occasion vessels carrying hazardous , toxic and radioactive wastes through the high seas surrounding a number of small island developing States , continues unattenuated .  
Generally , small island developing States face inordinate operational difficulties because of inadequate technically qualified human resources , poor infrastructure and installation , and deficient planning .  
However , despite improvements in legislative and institutional frameworks and the institution of mandatory requirements for environmental impact assessments for new tourism investments in some , small island developing States continue to face considerable difficulties in dealing with problems of waste management and pollution due to poor infrastructural , technological and human resource capacity .  
The disappointing results in the utilization of renewable energy sources are attributable mainly to a lack of information on the economic and technical viability of the technologies in small island developing States , and unaffordable prices of existing technologies , especially solar energy technology .  
In the area of trade , small island developing States are concerned about the impact on their exports of the widespread adoption of economic systems based on market forces , the emergence of regional trading blocs , and the erosion of trade preferences as the outcomes of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations are gradually implemented .  
For their part , most small island developing States face the reality of constrained domestic savings and public revenue potential due to a number of factors , notably the small size of their economies and the imperative of granting tax holidays and exemption from import and export duties to foreign investors in order to attract and retain foreign capital , which accounts for significant proportions of investments in major sectors , such as tourism , textiles and in some cases mining .  
A revised version of that paper , together with separate reports on the economic and ecological vulnerabilities of small island developing States to be prepared by consultants , will form the basis for discussions by an expert group meeting scheduled for the second half of 1997 .  
Across all small island developing States , however , a major area of concern will continue to be the impact of climate change and sea level rise on coastal areas , and the consequent need for costly remedial and protective measures .  
But the individual and collective efforts of small island developing States have so far made little or no real impact on the magnitude of the problems facing them , including the more frequent occurrence of hurricanes , storm surges and coastal inundation , and the resulting loss of valuable economic resources and marine biodiversity stocks .  
One set of concerns focuses on the environmental , economic and social consequences of the resource-intensive consumption patterns of the developed world - and , increasingly , the rapidly industrializing countries - another on the multiple problems bound up with economic stagnation , poverty and environmental degradation in some developing countries .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
The Conference of the Parties decided that the restructured GEF should continue , on an interim basis , to serve as the institutional structure on an interim basis , and in its decisions II / 6 and II / 7 instructed GEF to facilitate urgent implementation of articles 6 and 8 of the Convention by making available to developing country Parties financial resources for projects in a flexible and expeditious manner .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
A considerable number of non-governmental organizations , women groups and indigenous people in both developed and developing countries have expressed concern that the promotion of biotechnology is quite undesirable without some international mechanism in place to protect people from possible adverse effects resulting from genetically altered foods and animals , as well as from disadvantages that a biotechnology-driven market might bring to small farmers in developing countries .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
There is a developing recognition of the global effects of agricultural subsidies , and of the relationships between international trade agreements , food production in the drylands , the invaluable genetic reserve base , indigenous knowledge and development .  
Regarding the effects of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations on agricultural trade and production , various studies reflect the view that the direct impact of the Uruguay Round is likely to be negligible on global agricultural production , with some reduction in the output of temperate zone products in developed countries and a small offsetting rise in developing countries overall .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
While progress in adopting and implementing policies and programmes to promote and facilitate the transfer and diffusion of ESTs is well documented , it has been extremely difficult to make reliable estimates on the actual transfer of ESTs to developing countries and the real size and growth of EST markets , or on the share of investments that can be clearly assigned to financing of the transfer and diffusion of ESTs .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
Although no concrete data are available , there is overall recognition that the level of technology and technology-related investments from public and private sources in developed countries directed to developing countries has not , in general , been realized as envisaged at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
Joint ventures or other forms of foreign direct investment in developing countries that combine high-tech industrial knowledge of developed countries ' companies with low-tech indigenous knowledge of the host countries ' enterprises could become effective mechanisms for stimulating the demand for ESTs and thus promoting their transfer to , and diffusion in , developing countries .  
Such information could provide greater insights into ( a ) the relationship between environmental concerns and the demand for technologies and technological innovations ; ( b ) the effectiveness of company strategies for adapting to the requirements of technological change and support for production processes that are environmentally responsible and competitive ; and ( c ) trends regarding the dynamics of national environmental technology markets and more accurate international data regarding technology flows to developing countries .  
In the initial consultations between UNESCO , UNEP and IUCN on developing a broad international alliance for education for sustainable development , the crucial role of non-governmental organizations and other major groups was stressed .  
The changes called for - reforming educational systems , rethinking the outcomes of education , developing an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that reflects the complexity of the notion of sustainable development , agreeing on the key messages , changing attitude , lifestyles , and so on - will require time and the concerted effort and support of all sectors of society .  
These were the accession of more developing countries and economies in transition to WTO ; improvements in the human and administrative capacities of developing countries , leading to their greater involvement in initiatives in the WTO and in the regional trading arrangements ; and an improved understanding of the developmental dimension of the trade and environment nexus .  
Since supply capacities would play a crucial role in determining the extent to which developing countries ( and especially least developed countries ) could seize the opportunities arising from the Uruguay Round Agreements , the report identified some of the measures required for improving the domestic supply response .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
The first was the signing at Cairo of the African Nuclear _ Weapon _ Free Zone Treaty as a testimony to the developing countries ' commitment to the cause of nuclear disarmament worldwide and also as a positive and encouraging step which should be followed soon by the negotiation of the establishment of another zone in the Middle East in conformity with the relevant United Nations General Assembly resolutions and as a step towards the implementation of President Mubarak 's proposal concerning the establishment of a zone free from all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
These changes have led to the improved economic position of many farmers in some developing countries , but a great number of small and marginal agricultural producers , especially those in ecologically fragile and remote areas , are handicapped in their access to productive resources , and can not benefit fully from the improved overall environment and better price incentives .  
In addition , it is often argued that minimum wages in developing countries are distortionary , because they are set too high relative to the average income , thus raising production costs in the formal sector and discouraging employment .  
Moreover , family allowances are not common in developing countries , unemployment insurance rarely exists , and social security contributions are generally lower than in OECD countries . 7 Therefore , while some parts of the labour market regulations in developing countries are no longer compatible with today 's economic situation , whether or not there is a need for reform has to be ascertained from a specific examination of the empirical evidence . 
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
One such initiative was the establishment of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples , which had recommended that aboriginal women should be specifically included in any process to define the powers of aboriginal governments and should be assured of full and equal participation in decision-making bodies responsible for developing and implementing measures to ensure their physical and emotional security . 
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The report will highlight important findings announced at the London meeting , in particular , that the critical gap in knowledge of human amino acid requirements was that for lysine , which appears to be the limiting amino acid in the predominantly cereal diets of most developing countries .  
Procedures for developing the Unit 's programme of work will ensure that the items chosen are of major interest to Member States and constitute a direct response to the General Assembly 's request to JIU to continue focusing its reports on important priority items and identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing it and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
In both developed and developing countries they are in need of support if they are to manage the growing sustainability challenge posed by national and international environmental regulations , standards and voluntary codes that are developed by large companies .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
Finally , while FDI has contributed positively to the economic stability of many developing countries , the increasing importance of international portfolio investment has raised concern about the possible negative effects that such volatile investment could have for the stability of developing economies that are exposed to such flows .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
In its resolution , the Commission urged the international community to give the necessary support to developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments governing the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all .  
It requested the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of the phenomena and to include in her next report information on countries and enterprises engaged in the illicit traffic , as well as information on persons killed , maimed or injured in developing countries through this heinous act .  
Reaffirms also that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources to the developing countries , in particular in Africa , and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
First , in developing countries , developmental objectives and priorities such as foreign exchange generation , equitable income distribution , employment creation , the provision of basic human services and increasing competitiveness naturally have a bearing on the weight given in the overall policy mix to environmental issues , the implementation and effectiveness of internalization policies as well as the selection and combination of internalization instruments .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .  
At present , the Programmes ' main activities concentrated on : ( i ) access to finance on international terms and conditions ; ( ii ) setting up regional centres to promote competitiveness ; ( iii ) developing suppliers ; ( iv ) disseminating information and promoting innovation and technical change ; ( v ) improving transport , communications and the legal framework .  
Since UNCTAD did not have the resources to handle all the legal issues relevant to international trade and trade-related services , it could focus on a number of priority areas such as assisting developing countries in the modernization of trade-related national legislation , organization of educational programmes , preparation of information handbooks on legal aspects of international trade , advising Governments on measures to overcome legal impediments to the use of EDI , disseminating information on legislative reforms on issues such as electronic commerce and trade-related services , and legal assistance to Trade Points .  
ITC and UNCTAD have anticipated this trend , and our cooperation in the area of trade efficiency has been the sine qua non for the effective contribution we have been able to make in a practical , result _ oriented and business _ like fashion for making international trade transactions more efficient , less costly , and therefore more affordable to developing countries and their enterprises .  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Recognizing that , to be effective , a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new , alternative routes ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan expresses the hope that the leadership of the Russian Federation will take very serious note of Azerbaijan 's extreme concern at the illegal deliveries of weaponry to Armenia , and that the Russian reaction will be adequate and commensurate with the Russian Federation 's international responsibilities , its role as facilitator in the settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict , its authority , its national interests and the high level of progressively developing inter-State relations between Azerbaijan and the Russian Federation .  
The primary objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference would be ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional or global significance and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular developing countries , to use the applications of space research for economic , social and cultural development .  
While reviewing the sub-items below , special attention should be paid to the scientific and technological developments that had taken place , taking into account the interests of all countries , in particular the developing countries , with regard to the global , regional and national issues .  
On the basis of a comprehensive review of the activities of the Programme , the High Commissioner has developed the following policy orientation : the Programme focuses on countries in transition to democracy and less developed countries ; priority consideration is given to programmes addressing mandates emanating from the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action and from resolutions of United Nations organs , such as strengthening national capacities for the promotion and protection of human rights , the promotion of economic , social and cultural rights , developing national plans of action , and building national institutions .  
The subsequent report provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas and contribute to the achievement of national objectives , ensures coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors and sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Encourages further technical , educational and economic cooperation among States , in coordination with the United Nations Children 's Fund , other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , towards the development of human resources by nurturing the talents and potentials of children with disabilities , the development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and know-how , and the development of common standards for the national evaluation of childhood disability , with due regard for the situation of poor or developing countries ;  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking on behalf of the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
States should cooperate in facilitating more rational and equitable international economic relations and in encouraging structural changes in the context of a balanced economy in harmony with the needs and interests of all countries , especially developing countries , and should take appropriate measures to this end .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
As a result , the underlying concept of " Vienna " was that concerted governmental action at both international and national levels was required in order to build up endogenous capacities within developing countries .  
In order to achieve this , the foundation for a single normative legal basis is to be laid by the end of 1997 , chiefly by developing general norms as well as unifying civil and customs codes and simultaneously introducing common taxation legislation .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in those areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , particularly in developing countries .  
Further action at the international level includes recent decisions of the UNEP Governing Council and of IFCS at its second session to prepare for the expeditious conclusion of conventions on prior informed consent and persistent organic pollutants ( POPs ) , bearing in mind the need for a comprehensive approach to the control of such pollutants , including necessary international mechanisms to assist developing countries and economies in transition in implementing such conventions .  
External assistance for the building of requisite infrastructure and national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
Unpaid work in the household and in agriculture , and volunteer work should be measured and valued using improved methods including regular time-use studies , and international organizations and research institutions should provide technical assistance to developing countries in valuing and making visible women 's unpaid work . 
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , within her mandate , a global , multi _ disciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in , transfer to and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in African and other developing countries , with a view to making recommendations and proposals , in her next report , on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
Decides to continue consideration of the question of the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights at its fifty _ fourth session under the agenda item entitled : Question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , and study of special problems which the developing countries face in their efforts to achieve these human rights .  
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Considers that it is necessary , within the ongoing process of the restructuring of the Centre for Human Rights , to take urgent , concrete and immediate steps to change the prevailing distribution of posts of the staff of the Centre for Human Rights in favour of an equitable geographical distribution of those posts in accordance with Article 101 of the Charter , particularly by recruiting personnel from developing countries , including to key posts ;  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
Global Knowledge 97 will address a fundamental challenge facing developing countries and the international development community in the information age : given the vital role of knowledge in economic and social development , how can developing countries , and in particular the worlds poor , harness knowledge for development , participate in the global information economy and gain access to new tools for life-long learning ?  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
The documentation received from the Economic and Social Council and its bodies is of great interest to World YWCA and is shared as appropriate with newly developing and member national associations in 95 countries through specific correspondence , general mailings of reproduced United Nations information / publications , the monthly publication Advocacy and Briefing Notes and quarterly publications with more extensive coverage of selected issues .  
In view of Egypt 's perception of the important and vital role of the United Nations and the significance of its operational activities in bringing stability and providing support for national institutions that operate in the developing countries in the sphere of national reconciliation , we stress here the relevance of supporting the efforts of President Preval to overcome the political crisis facing Haiti , and that attainment of final resolutions of the main areas of dispute among the political actors , namely , elections , economic reform and the appointment of a new Prime Minister .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Noting that El Ni �� has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
Invites States , intergovernmental organizations and all those participating in the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to provide technical and financial assistance , including national capacity-building , to developing countries to support global and regional observation systems and research , including the dissemination of data on El Ni �� , to prevent , mitigate and redress the negative effects of the phenomenon ;  
Calls upon both the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , including bilateral cooperation , to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts in dealing with transit issues , inter alia , by improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations , developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport , and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport , and , in this respect , notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field ;  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries , and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
The differing positions of the developed and developing countries on the issue must be reconciled if the international community was to have a civil and constructive dialogue instead of what could easily be a highly contentious and acrimonious debate .  
The underlying reason for submitting the draft resolution was the fact that the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights in an increasing number of developing countries had reached alarming proportions and had had adverse economic , social and cultural effects .  
The topics discussed included the varying experiences of world regions regarding mortality , epidemiological and health transitions ; the problems faced in measuring mortality levels and mortality by cause of death , particularly in developing countries ; the various approaches to the measurement of health status and their limitations ; the health and mortality situation in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries ; and the relevance of risk factors underlying major causes of death for the formulation of health interventions .  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
He called on the international community to take effective measures to remove the root causes of hegemonism , the inequitable international economic order , the widening gap between rich and poor countries , and war , poverty and discrimination ; to end the neglect of economic , social and cultural rights , which were of concern to developing countries ; and to implement the long-delayed right to development .  
The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Loss of experienced personnel and skilled labour , declines in productivity , the need for increased resources to hire and retrain replacements , increased absenteeism and labour turnover , increased health-care costs , coupled with the human and social costs endured by the individuals and communities affected by the pandemic are imposing heavy burdens , particularly on developing countries with limited resources .  
Convinced that small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the potential effects of global climate change and sea level rise , and that tropical storms , the El Ni �� phenomenon and drought have resulted in the inundation of some islands and have caused serious loss of resources in their exclusive economic zones , economic infrastructure , human settlements and culture ,  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
Invites the Commission on Sustainable Development , the United Nations Environment Programme and other relevant United Nations bodies , funds and programmes , and the World Tourism Organization , to urgently develop strategies with existing national , regional and subregional tourism organizations in small island developing States to further facilitate sustainable tourism development as an essential element towards an action-oriented international programme of work on sustainable tourism ;  
Stresses also in this context the need for various measures by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , especially the least developed countries , for their full integration into the world economy ;  
Reiterates the importance of trade liberalization in developed and developing countries and the need to continue liberalization , particularly in areas of interest to developing countries , through , inter alia , a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers , and also reiterates the need for the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , which will have the effect of improving access for the exports of developing countries , enhancing the competitiveness of their domestic industries and facilitating structural adjustment among developed economies ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
The conferences , held in South Africa , focused on reorganizing the judiciary ; adopting a bill of rights ; developing affirmative action programmes ; designing a nationwide public defender service ; comparing institutional models for enforcing a constitutional guarantee of gender equality , and evaluating electoral systems .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , and to help them exit from the rescheduling process , Noting that developing countries have undertaken stabilization and structural adjustment programmes that benefit those countries but also involve social costs ,  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of indebted developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of many developing countries , on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach and , where appropriate , addressing the full stock of debt of the poorest and most indebted developing countries as a matter of priority ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
As the growing operating deficits of inefficient public enterprises compounded the decline in real fiscal revenues during the recession of the early 1990s in many developing countries , disillusionment with their performance became increasingly common .  
Technical advisory services on economic , demographic , social , industrial , energy and environment , and trade statistics to developing countries and countries with economies in transition ; and ad hoc provision of technical cooperation services on national accounts and computers and informatics ;  
In the resolution concerning the question of the realization in all countries of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and study of special problems which the developing countries faced in their efforts to achieve those human rights , the Commission called upon States to secure , through national development policies and international cooperation , full respect for economic , social and cultural rights , giving priority to individuals , most often women , living in extreme poverty .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
This is achieved by analysing and understanding the key elements of international transactions , including the relevant elimination of constraints ; developing methods to facilitate transactions , including the relevant use of information technologies ; promoting both the use of these methods and associated best practices through channels such as governmental , industry and service associations ; coordinating and integrating the work under the subprogramme with other international organizations ; and securing coherence by cooperating with other interested parties in recognition that the work has broad application in the areas beyond global commerce .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
In addition to general problems facing developing countries , those island Territories also suffer handicaps arising from the interplay of such factors as geographic isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , the fragility of their ecosystems , constraints in transport and communications , isolation from market centres , limited internal market , lack of natural resources and serious gaps in technological capacities ( in human and material terms ) . 
Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
Although the importance of education , from the primary stage to university , is widely accepted as critical for sustained development , many developing societies continue to suffer from a growing mismatch between the skills generated by the educational system and those that are needed by the productive system .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
A more equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks require careful management of public policies and coordination of national and global policies dealing with markets , as well as stronger international support for infrastructure and human resources development in developing countries .  
Although , in the Declaration adopted by the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore , Ministers rejected the use of labour standards for protectionist purposes and agreed that the comparative advantage of countries , particularly low-wage developing countries , must in no way be put into question , the continuing calls for higher labour , social and environmental standards are seen by many in developing countries as a way of promoting new and disguised forms of protectionism .  
These conflicting perceptions and the underlying policy dilemmas could be reconciled better in the context of a more comprehensive and global policy dialogue designed to promote coherent policies in all countries for more balanced growth and development and to reduce unemployment in developed and developing countries . 
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
While Governments may have assisted in making globalization possible by reducing legal and administrative barriers to flows between countries and regions , the main actors in the process have been mostly private enterprises , largely based in developed countries , although , in recent years , enterprises from newly industrialized countries have become active in other developing countries .  
The Presidents reached agreement on the main tasks for further developing and deepening Russian-Ukrainian ties , and stated that the paramount task was to ensure the practical implementation of the provisions of the new general political Treaty signed during the visit .  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
IS3.18 Requirements of $ 33,500 , reflecting a reduction of $ 22,600 , would cover travel for promotional and representational activities with respect to establishing cooperation with national postal administrations , maintaining contact with international and national philatelic organizations , developing new sources for the distribution of United Nations postage stamps , representation at major international philatelic shows and for coordination meetings of the activities of the three offices .  
Moreover , the major donors stated in 1995 that the role of external partners is to help strengthen capacities in developing partner countries , and that the dominant conception of the mission of development assistance is to help countries and societies to strengthen their economic , human , social and institutional capacities for self-sustaining development .  
With the waning of ideological confrontations , the rise in globalization , and the deepening of interdependence among nations , the historic opportunity has arisen for constructive dialogue among all countries , in particular among the developed and developing countries , and political mobilization for the promotion of international cooperation for development based on genuine partnership and mutuality of interests and benefits .  
While the end of the cold war has fostered a new spirit of dialogue and cooperation at the global political level , there is a need to improve the international economic environment so that it is more conducive to the socio-economic development of developing countries , including through the fulfilment of commitments agreed to at the recent major United Nations conferences .  
However , some developing countries have limited scope for increasing savings because of their low per capita income levels and because levels of consumption are already low and are difficult to restrain further ; these countries will continue to need substantial external resources as an important complement to domestic efforts to stimulate their development . 
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
As part of these shared responsibilities , interested developed and developing country partners could agree on mutual commitments to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
The savings efforts of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , to generate sufficient domestic savings need to be supplemented by external resources so as to raise investment to the levels necessary for adequate sustained economic growth .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
As in most developed-country markets , there are regulations which specify the types of packs that are acceptable and the information that labels must contain , and health regulations which are often justified both in terms of hygienic conditions and the use of harmful chemical additives , pesticides and fertilizers , but which can be so complicated and restrictive that they act as barriers for developing country suppliers .  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
In accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 122 of 19 December 1994 , the analytical work and technical cooperation of UNCTAD related to small developing States , which also supports the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , is aimed at preventing the phenomenon of marginalization faced by those countries in the global economy , and involves assistance to national macroeconomic policies and improving their micro-economic trade environment .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
The Task Force is focusing on country-level follow-up , and at its most recent meeting , the Chairperson emphasized that special attention should be focused on developing partnerships with non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society in assisting countries in achieving the goals agreed to at the recent United Nations global conferences .  
In the area of reproductive health and family planning , the Population Division of ESCAP has initiated a regional project to strengthen monitoring and information systems to provide accurate and timely indicators and has been assisting Governments in developing and strengthening policies for involving the elderly in social and economic development .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries to improve energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ; "  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
Top priority should be attached to supporting the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , and international organizations to eradicate the major infectious diseases , especially malaria , which is on the increase , to improve and expand basic health and sanitation services , and to provide safe drinking water .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
The objectives envisaged in this section should reflect the need for equity , adequate energy supplies and increasing energy consumption in developing countries and should take into account the situation of countries that are highly dependent on income generated from the production , processing and export , and / or consumption , of fossil fuels and that have serious difficulties in switching to alternative sources of energy , and the situation of countries highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
For developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , ODA remains a main source of external funding ; it is essential for the prompt and effective implementation of Agenda 21 and can not generally be replaced by private capital flows .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
Members will recall that , on the occasion of that historic event , the debate about our common future was often polarized into the choice between rural sustainability and urban migration , between the green agenda and the brown agenda , between developed and developing economies .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
We need solutions that can be attained only with deep and enlightened research and that are based on scientific fact , solutions that aim to be balanced and that take into consideration the international economic system and the interests of the economies of the developing countries in particular .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In this context , our Government has implemented programmes for combating desertification , expanding green areas and developing biological diversity systems , and we have established research centres to develop genetic strains of flora and fauna adapted to our harsh environmental conditions .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
These challenges shelter and housing and the need to address urbanization both impact disproportionately and very severely on hundreds of millions of poor and disadvantaged people in nations large and small people who , mostly but not in all cases , live in the developing countries of our world ; people who are huddled in vast urban slums or in rural shacks ; people who lack not just secure work , but also such basic necessities as clean water , sanitation , waste disposal , safe transportation and even the most minimal green spaces to call their own .  
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
Given the extent of violations of the right to a healthy environment , the international community expressed its profound concern , at the 1992 Earth Summit , noting that some international movements of toxic wastes were in contravention of national legislation and existing international instruments , seriously damaging the environment and public health in all countries , particularly the developing ones .  
The wealthy Powers preferred to embark on an insane and increasingly expensive arms race which geared their economies to military objectives and diverted funds from aid that could have helped the developing countries .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
Gravely concerned that the persistent insufficiency and decline of resources for operational activities for development , in particular of core resources , is seriously affecting the priorities and the capacity of the United Nations funds and programmes to carry out their functions and to respond effectively to the increasing needs of all developing countries , as well as seriously eroding their fundamental mandates and characteristics , particularly their universal and multilateral character ,  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .  
In order to facilitate the review of the progress in the development of transit systems by the above mentioned meeting of governmental experts convened pursuant to paragraph 11 of General Assembly 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD made arrangements , with the financial support of the UNDP , to undertake comprehensive regional and subregional analytical studies which highlighted recent developments on the transit transport sector of land-locked and transit developing countries and made recommendations for future action .  
In his introductory statement , the Officer-in-Charge of the Office of the Special Coordinator for LDCs , speaking on behalf of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD , said that the particular problems facing land-locked developing countries resulting from inadequate and poor transit transport infrastructure facilities and services as well as from inappropriate transit policies continued to be a major cause of excessively high transport costs .  
The Ministers reviewed the activities of CPLP , with special focus on the plan of action of the Executive Secretariat , as approved by the Ministerial Meeting held in New York on 26 September 1996 , and they reaffirmed their confidence in CPLP as a privileged instrument for consolidating , developing and enhancing their common historical ties , on the basis of the shared principles of peace , democracy , social justice and economic progress . 
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
While saluting the efforts of the document 's authors , his delegation considered that it might be possible to make a less rigorous procedure for access to the geostationary orbit available solely to systems intended exclusively to serve the territory of a specific developing country and not to provide an international link , but not to the so-called " paper " satellite systems . 
Whilst the environmental objectives of MEAs have received broad public support , it has been increasingly recognized that MEAs involve important economic and developmental issues , and that compliance costs may differ widely across developed and developing country parties , thus raising issues related to equity .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
The committee has formulated a programme of activities with the following main features : ( a ) coordinating all actions launched at the national level ; ( b ) promoting income-generating projects , housing , education and health programmes and involving women in the process of development ; ( c ) developing an employment scheme taking into account the resources and potentials of the informal sector and the need to provide support to women involved in self-employment activities .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
Governments of developing countries have sought to promote industrial development and export expansion not only through macro-economic policies aimed at providing favourable framework conditions , but also through policy measures at the microeconomic level intended to reduce supply-side impediments by accelerating the dynamic process of accumulation of physical capital , skills and technology .  
Where developing countries have been watchful of the cost of incentives and applied them within an outward-oriented approach , microeconomic measures addressing specific supply constraints have helped build supply capabilities which the private sector could not have accomplished as rapidly by itself . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 24 \ x { ffff } .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
Scientific , technical and cultural progress and the information revolution of the past decade had made the mass media an important instrument and a true reflection of current international realities in places , especially in developing countries , undergoing civil wars and conflicts .  
While the Working Group had noted with satisfaction the valuable efforts to implement the recommendations of UNISPACE 82 , it had identified four priority areas where further efforts should be made to promote the applications of space science and technology for development : stimulation and support of the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology in developing countries ; promotion of a greater exchange of actual experiences in space applications ; and funding of the Programme of Space Applications and voluntary contributions for its activities .  
COPUOS should play a greater role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space , strengthening the international legal order in space , stimulating scientific and technological progress in the developing countries and helping them to share in the spin-off benefits of space technology .  
Recently , many developing countries have abandoned the policy of supporting industrialization by maintaining agricultural prices low across the board and left prices to be determined on the market , expecting that resources would thus be allocated efficiently and market opportunities would be exploited .  
Mineral resource development may provide a boost to developing economies otherwise poor in natural and human resources and allow rapid economic growth , provided that the problems of macro-economic stability associated with mineral dependence , in particular the influence of mineral revenues on the real exchange rate and the effect of mining wage rates on overall wage levels , can be mastered .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
Based on the lessons drawn from those experiences , UNICEF had concentrated its activities , throughout the preparatory process for Habitat II and during the Conference itself , on putting children at the centre of the concerns of Habitat II , identifying poverty as the main cause of ill health in urban children , developing policies that led to a better distribution of the fruits of economic growth , reaffirming housing rights and defending the role of cities in guaranteeing the well-being of their inhabitants and not merely economic growth . 
In addition to the exodus from the countryside and chaotic urbanization , problems common to all developing countries , Lebanon encountered other difficulties : the destruction of housing and infrastructure ; the collapse of economic and cultural institutions ; the displacement of more than 100,000 families ; an unbalanced geographical distribution of the population ; a rise in unemployment ; the devastation of arable land ; stagnation in industry , tourism and commerce ; frequent human rights violations ; a breakdown of social and moral values ; growing drug use ; and increasing juvenile crime . 
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
In that respect , the developed countries should stop seeking immediate gain and , keeping long-term interests in mind , should create a favourable international climate through fulfilment of their commitments in the area of official development assistance and the adoption of effective measures to solve the debt problem of the heavily indebted countries , lift trade restrictions and expand access to markets .  At the same time , they should step up technical cooperation and promote the transfer of technology to developing countries to improve their scientific and technological capabilities .  
Nevertheless , such indicators were of relative significance ; they did not reflect the trend in all regions of the South , where the general economic situation of most countries continued to be very troubling , as evidenced by the long list of least developed countries and countries in which poverty , hunger and disease continued to wreak havoc among broad segments of the population , particularly in Africa and small island developing States .  
He urged the international community to adopt specific measures to stabilize the international economic environment , thereby supporting the developing countries in their efforts to mitigate the political and social costs of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms , rather than simply limiting themselves to the re-establishment of their credit ratings and the liberalization of their markets at all costs .  
The next ministerial meeting of WTO , to be held in Singapore by the end of the year , should assess the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements , focusing on the difficulties of the developing countries , especially the least developed and net food-importing countries , so as to ensure that all countries benefited from free trade and to sweep away any remaining protectionist or discriminatory notions .  
In view of the limited budgetary resources allocated to development , some sectors had shown a marked interest in broadening the purview of the financial institutions and intergovernmental organizations with respect to development issues , which would , in the long run , have the effect of reducing still further the participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process , contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the global dimension which should characterize the solution of the world 's problems .  
With regard to the Framework Convention on Climate Change , the developed countries were apparently unable to fulfil their commitments regarding emissions of greenhouse gases within the agreed time limit , and the situation in developing countries , considering their limited technical and technological capabilities , was likely to be the same .  
Other activities included working jointly with the World Bank on ( a ) a revised and updated Glossary of the legal and economic terms fundamental to competition law and policy ( to be published in 1997 ) , an earlier version of which has been translated into several languages , including Russian and Spanish ; and ( b ) a Competition Manual for transition and developing countries ( to be published in 1997 ) .  
Up to 40 missions to Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request and in cooperation with United Nations agencies and regional commissions , related to formulation of strategies that promote sustainable development , including financing of sustainable development , use of economic instruments and building relevant institutional capacities , including for monitoring and assessment , as well as related to the management of mineral , water and energy resources ; ( ii ) Training . 
While it was currently agreed that economic globalization and the laws of the market had become the new rules of the game , the conditions in which the game was played were far from equitable and had aggravated the economic disparities between developed and developing countries .  
Each developing country should adopt macroeconomic policies conducive to domestic savings and investment , which had more impact on growth than external contributions , and should stress human resources development , education and health at the social level and respect for the rule of law at the political level .  
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
As indicated in paragraphs 7 to 10 of that report , over the past few years , increasingly large amounts of private capital had moved from developed countries to a number of developing countries in Asia , Latin America and the Middle East ; while such inflows had generally promoted economic growth , they had sometimes generated inflationary pressures and , in some instances , sudden capital outflows as a result of a loss of confidence by investors .  
It was paradoxical that , as indicated in the same report , a strong official presence which could provide assistance and address global problems that put development progress at risk was still lacking , at a time when the world had been freed from the adverse effects of the cold war and the needs of the developing countries were growing rapidly .  
Since debt problems varied considerably from country to country , debt relief measures needed to be adapted to the needs of each case ; to that end , through an evolving debt strategy , the international financial community had contributed significantly to the introduction of improvements in developing countries based on sound economic policies and programmes of adjustment and reform .  
However , those various strategies had been no more than a palliative since , as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on the developing country debt situation ( A / 51 / 294 ) , in 1995 the gross external debt of capital-importing developing countries had grown by 7.4 per cent compared with the previous year and , according to World Bank data , 16 of the 52 countries classified that year as heavily indebted countries were middle-income countries .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
Despite the political and economic development achieved at the regional and international levels , the establishment of economic groupings and the expansion of free trade , there had been an increase in poverty , diseases and illiteracy resulting in a deterioration in the standards of living of developing countries .  Moreover , economic barriers continued to be erected against developing countries .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
She hoped , however , that the international community would not limit its efforts to the application of that initiative but would also propose solutions that were suitable to the developing countries , especially the least developed ones , so that they could use their national financial resources to undertake economic reforms that were vital for their development .  85 .  Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .  
Other critical factors needed for effective dialogue include : ensuring the promotion of an entrepreneurial culture in developing countries in general ; addressing ideological resistance to the transition from a command economy to a market economy ; and putting in place measures which foster the integration of informal sector enterprises into the formal sector of the economy .  
Recognizing the potentially adverse impact of large fluctuations among the major international currencies on developing countries , Ministers consider it imperative that the Fund fully exercise its powers to ensure effective surveillance over the macroeconomic policies of the countries involved in the management of these currencies .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
The objective of the colloquium was to draw upon the real experiences of high-level executives from developed , developing and transitional economies , in order to extract comparative lessons on impediments to successful public-private partnerships worldwide .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
The difficulties faced by developing countries in seeking access to trade , labour and finance flows were exacerbated by protectionist barriers raised by the advanced countries because of the unfounded fear that globalization was one of the major causes of the high unemployment rate and growing wage differentials between skilled and unskilled labour . 
Co-operate in developing at the national and , where appropriate , regional level , systematic observation and data archives , scientific and technical research , and support for improving endogenous capacities and capabilities to participate in international and intergovernmental programmes , conferences , meetings and seminars related to the climate system , and the enhancement of access to , and exchange of , data and analyses thereof , obtained from areas beyond national jurisdiction , taking into account the particular concerns and needs of developing country Parties in implementing Article 5 of the Convention .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another .  
Iraq is a developing country that is suffering greatly as a result of the coercive economic policies and measures exemplified in the complete economic embargo imposed on it more than seven years ago that affect the health of the Iraqi people and every aspect of its economic , social and cultural life .  
On the contrary , the Congress of the Republic of Venezuela has expressed in numerous statements its categorical repudiation of unilateral coercive acts that adversely affect the economies of developing countries , on the ground that such acts contravene the basic principles of coexistence and international economic cooperation and the world consensus regarding the need for a non-discriminatory and open trading system .  
The concept of coercive economic measures embraces a variety of issues related to : ( a ) identification of essential elements , distinctive features and limitations of a definition of such measures ; ( b ) specification and classification of motives and policy objectives of sender States in resorting to economic coercion against target States , in particular developing countries ; and ( c ) categorization or selection of specific types of relevant measures , as well as analysis of their anticipated and actual effects .  
It recommended that analytical and conceptual work be carried out both at the specialized level ( e.g . , through continued efforts for developing methodologies and criteria for impact assessment ) and on an interdisciplinary scale ( i.e . , interrelationship between the political , legal , economic and social dimensions of the problem ) .  
National coordinating agencies will receive guidance and advice in mobilizing private-sector investment , conducting feasibility studies , developing marketing strategies , identifying effective credit schemes , organizing international round tables , negotiating debt swaps and assisting national authorities seeking extensions or enlargement of current international preferential trade arrangements for selected Andean exports . 
This set of activities also includes acquisition and distribution of reference samples of drugs under international control , their metabolites and of controlled chemicals and precursors to national laboratories in developing countries , drug-testing laboratories participating in the international collaborative exercises , regional training centres and collaborating institutions ; production and distribution of drug and precursor identification kits to law enforcement agencies ; and organization of expert group meetings on laboratory methodologies and standard guidelines .  
The rapidly increasing economic interdependence of countries which has characterized the globalization phenomenon over the past decade has been nowhere better manifested than in the growing participation of the developing countries in international trade and capital flows , thus improving the global division of labour and allocation of savings and investment .  
But for many developing country enterprises , quite the opposite may also be true : exposed to international competition , or to domestic competition from firms established with the help of FDI , they may be unable to compete .  
Striking a balance between the static and dynamic components of competition is particularly difficult for developing countries in todays globalizing world , where the gaps - whether measured in terms of income , productivity performance or technological capacities - are greater than ever , and where small market size , limited availability of entrepreneurs and of production inputs , outmoded technology , inefficient distribution and communications systems or poor information flows combine to create barriers to market entry .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
On the eve of the new millennium , I am still quite dissatisfied with the level of attention the world community is paying to the severe economic , environmental and potential political problems that threaten small island developing States .  
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
Intensified cooperation between the United Nations and the IPU is essential for an effective , vibrant , modern and reformed United Nations which is responsive to the concerns of the vast majority of its Members the developing countries .  
Although foreign direct investment flows to developing countries have been increasing , the opposite has been the case with Africa , where even the little that has been directed to the continent has been decreasing over the years .  
We also support IAEA activities to put a halt to illegal trafficking in nuclear materials and activities aimed at increasing the level of physical protection and developing national systems for the inventory and verification of nuclear materials .  
For Malaysia , as a developing country , economic , social and cultural rights , articulated through the larger framework of the right to development , are as important as civil and political rights .  
From the time Kyrgyzstan became independent , we have pursued a policy of developing and strengthening broad regional and international cooperation in specific areas , including the control of narcotic drugs .  
He hoped that the international community would assist Equatorial Guinea in the task of developing civil , political , economic and social rights , which were indispensable if democracy was to be strengthened .  
A whole range of interrelated factors of a legal , economic , social and political nature contribute to the emergence and development of the movement of toxic wastes and dangerous products between the industrialized and the developing countries .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , smaller countries and developing countries may never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
In addition , the formulation of national plans and their implementation would help create a favourable social , economic , political , health , educational and family environment for children , in both developed and developing countries .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
Given the demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce as a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
These institutions succeeded where traditional public programmes failed , and she supported UNCTADs initiative aimed at creating an essential direct link between private investors and micro finance institutions in developing countries . 
The recent increase in mineral investment in developing economies provides an opportunity to develop creative partnerships at the local level to integrate mine development into a wider regional strategy for improving economic and social conditions .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The variables were standardized and equal weights assigned to them in the computation of the composite vulnerability index , which confirmed that small island developing States were generally more vulnerable than larger countries . 
Partnerships between the public and private sectors , which are becoming common in many developing countries , ensure that essential skills and theory acquired through formal education are complemented by enterprise-based practical training .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
Such assistance represented 8.4 per cent of its gross national product , one of the highest rates in the world , and reflected its concern to raise the standard of living of the developing countries by helping to strengthen their economic infrastructure .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
He urged the international community to increase direct foreign investment , especially in Africa , as it was insufficient despite the structural adjustment programmes undertaken by the developing countries in order to create a favourable economic environment . 
To date over 80 bilateral agreements covering the economic , trade , scientific , industrial , technical and environmental fields had been signed with developing countries and countries in transition .  
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
With the encroachment of agriculture on natural or quasi-natural ecosystems , plant and animal genetic resources are being lost , modern cultivars are replacing local ones and intensive livestock production systems are developing .  
The experiences of small island developing States to date suggest that institutional and administrative capacity-building is a protracted and complex process that requires sustained political commitment and sufficient resources .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
Further , widespread discrimination based on gender , ethnicity and religious belief is reported daily and extreme poverty and marginalization is the fate of many in both developing and developed countries .  
Examples were given of national programmes in developing and developed countries and of international programmes based on bilateral , regional and international cooperation , including programmes of technical cooperation between developing countries .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Noting that El Nino has a recurring character and has produced disastrous effects , resulting in large material , economic , human and environmental losses , with particular impact in the coastal countries of the Pacific Ocean , especially in developing countries ,  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
However , the unique demographic , economic and geographic constraints faced by small island developing States call for a strengthening of the concerted efforts at human resource development .  
Given demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce to be a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Governments of industrialized and developing countries alike should join forces with international organizations and the scientific community to develop global environmental observing systems related to climate , oceans and terrestrial ecosystems .  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
AOUIJ said that , although the extent to which political power was shared between women and men in Denmark constituted a model for developing and developed countries alike , economic power was not shared to the same extent .  
In developing a national legislation , it has been found convenient to first construct an umbrella or a framework environmental law which lays down the basic legal principles without attempting to codify all relevant statutory provisions .  
The dynamism of tourism is expected to continue outpacing economic growth in the future , driven by globalization , economic expansion in developing countries and in countries in transition , structural and demographic change in developed countries , and so on .  
In adopting its agreed conclusions on the subject in 1995 , the Council took a major step forward by providing a coherent set of guidelines for developing a coordinated response to this global agenda at the intergovernmental as well as the inter-agency level .  
Pursuant to various legislative mandates , the United Nations Programme in Public Administration and Finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
The other half include mainly fuels , minerals , wood , other basic commodities and intermediate inputs required by industry , as well as certain tropical and fishery products of substantial export interest to a wide range of developing countries .  
Rapidly rising tariffs , from low rates for raw materials to higher rates for intermediate products and sometimes peak rates for finished industrial products , continue to hamper vertical diversification and industrialization in developing countries .  
Tax administrators from developing and transitional economy countries encounter considerable difficulties in understanding the controversial taxation issues involved in , for example , transfer pricing mechanisms and innovative financial instruments .  
With rising worldwide demand for mobile satellite services , especially in developing countries , which often lack an adequate terrestrial telephone line infrastructure , planned LEO and MEO systems will supplement GEO satellite communications services .  
A new multimedia central editorial board will be established , with the objective of developing and maintaining a timely and more effective news gathering and delivery capacity , tied as much as possible to the global daily news cycle .  
His delegation believed that two factors were essential for that revitalization , namely , the adoption by developing countries of sound , sustained internal policies and the existence of a favourable global economic environment .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
He remarked that urgent measures should be taken to erase the external debts of the developing countries , many of which were so crippled by debt servicing that they were unable to provide basic economic and social services .  
In the developing and least developed countries , where structural reform efforts had proved insufficient , external aid remained indispensable to the achievement of development , economic diversification and investment in human resources .  
In addition to the more obvious manifestations , developing countries practised more subtle forms of racial discrimination through immigration laws based on ethnic and regional considerations .  
Principle 11 of the Rio Declaration stated that environmental standards applied by some countries might be inappropriate and of unwarranted economic and social cost to other countries , in particular developing countries .  
We also believe that countries with sophisticated and effective early warning systems have a crucial role to play in providing adequate and timely information to allow developing countries to prepare for impending disasters .  
The least developed countries had received only a tiny portion of foreign direct investment in developing countries , which underscored the need to mobilize private capital for the least developed countries at a time when ODA continued to decline .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
However , the implications of that approach as it applied to economic , social and cultural rights , development and the sharing of obligations at the national and international levels were less evident , particularly in the case of developing countries .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
More flexible provisions could also provide a legal base for unilateral trade preferences offered by developed countries to regional sub-groups of developing countries , such as special preferences of that kind in favour of sub-Saharan African economies .  
This vicious circle , which affects in particular the developing world , where more than 90 per cent of infected people live , has a huge impact on the future of our societies because most infected people are in their peak productive and reproductive years . 
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
Thirdly , rather than providing temporary services for the poor , the main objective of IFAD is to develop viable and financially sustainable rural financial systems , especially for the very poor living in remote areas in many developing countries .  
All staff with supervisory / managerial responsibilities are required to have additional goals that relate to managing human and financial resources ; leading , motivating and developing staff ; and demonstrating gender and cross-cultural responsiveness ;  
One expert from a developing country which had announced the introduction of a GSP for LDCs raised the question of the proper legal accommodation under WTO rules for autonomous preferential market access for LDCs .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
In parallel , the system of international cooperation must be strengthened in order to transfer the financial , technological and scientific resources of the most highly developed economies to the developing countries .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
It was also stated that for a number of developing countries there was still a crucial need for continued ODA flows since the current levels of trade and foreign investment could not provide for their essential needs , including basic infrastructure .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
The smallness of small island developing States means that natural disasters combine with other environmental , social , and economic processes , such as climate change , ozone depletion , sea level rise , freshwater shortages , deforestation , economic marginalization consequent to trade liberalization and globalization , and growing poverty , to compound the intensity of risks .  
The effects of the El Nio Southern Oscillation , the disastrous impacts of hurricanes George and Mitch , the rising costs of natural disasters to small island developing States and the growing impact on their fragile economies are sufficient reason to launch national , regional and global consultations on the necessity for strengthening disaster prevention and preparedness measures and policies to attenuate the impacts of natural disasters on an urgent basis .  
The geophysical settings of many small island developing States leave them vulnerable not only to extreme climatological and seismic events but more critically to periods of low recharge and adverse environmental impacts , including pollution , saline intrusion , soil erosion and mass wasting .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
Information received from a number of regional institutions indicate , however , that they are still unable to meet the technical assistance needs of small island developing States in their respective regions on account of a number of constraints , which are briefly outlined in section III below .  
Although the prime responsibility for the execution of regional programmes and projects rests with small island developing States Governments , in view of the meagre resources of individual small island developing States and the high costs of regional programmes there is an obvious need for adequate financial support from the international community for timely and effective implementation of regional programmes .  
The assessment provides the framework for developing possible future technical cooperation activities to strengthen national efforts in identified areas to contribute to the achievement of national objectives and , by ensuring coordination with existing or planned assistance from other donors , sometimes facilitates additional support from other international sources .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
And the real value of fish and fish products will have to be acknowledged , in terms of economic and social contributions as well as the environmental costs ( for example , of uncontrolled aquaculture ) , especially for the developing countries , whose net fisheries exports have now grown to be worth an estimated $ 13-billion annually .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources for the advancement of women , will also be required ;  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
Practical measures were needed to alleviate the heavy debt burden shouldered by developing countries , and those measures should be carried out at the multilateral level without diverting development funds from other uses or increasing pressure on bilateral donors .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
However , despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of developing countries , including Mozambique , had implemented structural adjustment programmes , liberalized their economies and undertaken other reforms which had had serious social consequences , financial resource flows had diminished , resulting in a vicious circle of economic stagnation and financial crisis .  
The external debt of the developing countries , particularly the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , continued to deprive them of the resources needed for social and economic development and for the creation of an enabling environment for sustained growth .  
To that end , international cooperation would have to be intensified by improving trade relations and access to markets , sharing new technologies , creating a favourable international financial and economic order and allocating increased development resources to developing countries .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
Mr . Beti ( Observer for Switzerland ) said that the area of activity of UNITAR was training and institutional capacity-building , which consisted of assisting developing countries and countries in transition to better understand international issues such as negotiation , the peaceful settlement of disputes , modern information and communications technologies , environmental development or sound financial management .  
The Preparatory Conference established the following general objectives : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Low conversion efficiency remains a problem in many developing countries ; however , gains in processing efficiency in many industrialized countries , coupled with increasing use of recovered or non-wood fibre in pulp and paper manufacture , have helped to moderate global demand for wood raw material from forests .  
Future efforts by international organizations , multilateral institutions and instruments should be flexible in order to accommodate existing and emerging needs , as well as the different levels of social and economic development of countries , in particular developing countries .  
Most developing countries encounter enormous difficulties in providing timely responses to the demands and to implement the substantive objectives of most instruments and conventions and in putting into practice their compliance requirements , due to their limited institutional and financial capacity , lack of manpower and managerial skills and inadequate or non-enforced national legislative frameworks to support these instruments .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
Urge developed countries and relevant organizations to review their international assistance in forestry to improve institutional capacities of developing countries , to base their assistance on the priorities identified in the national forest programmes of recipient countries , to increase effectiveness of available resources , and to increase their ODA contributions ;  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
The executive boards had accomplished a great deal in the area of funding strategies , but much remained to be done in order to ensure predictable , assured funding of activities within the United Nations mandate and of efforts to achieve the ambitious goals set at United Nations conferences and to meet the needs of developing countries .  
The steps already taken by the executive boards of United Nations funds and programmes should be built upon to arrest and reverse the decline in core resources and enhance the effectiveness of operational activities in various ways , including a substantial increase in their funding that would commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  If the current deplorable situation was allowed to continue , there would be a drastic reduction in United Nations operational activities .  
However , the overemphasis on export-led growth , particularly on export agriculture and mineral extraction , merely reinforced the inherited colonial division of labour which condemned many developing nations to supplying raw materials to industrialized nations and trapped them into importing finished goods at much higher prices .  
Meanwhile , we must let the rest of the world understand the real nature of this conflict - that this is not just another internal conflict in some small and distant developing country , but an armed rebellion , externally inspired and maintained , against the people of Sierra Leone and their democratically elected Government .  
Affirms that international cooperation is acknowledged more than ever as a necessity deriving from recognized mutual interest and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Strongly reaffirms that the impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52 / 12 B ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to efforts to eradicate poverty and that this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation , measures to ensure food security , the provision of better education , greater utilization of appropriate technology , fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment and increased productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
It was , therefore , discouraging to note that , in addition to suffering from long-standing problems , such as declining commodity prices and worsening terms of trade , the developing countries were also having to face new problems as a result of developments in the world economy , current international economic problems and even natural phenomena , the direct and indirect effects of which had exacerbated their problems . 
The developing countries difficult situation was further compounded by their lack of technological capabilities , since commodities were becoming less important ( particularly in view of the growing use of manufactured products ) , trade preferences were being eliminated and a new trend had arisen in the commodities futures markets and was threatening to destabilize the earnings of countries dependent on such goods . 
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
UNIDO , with its capacity to carry out objective and independent studies of the global , regional , national and sectoral issues that affected industrial development , could provide the developing countries with valuable sources of information and advice in that area .  
In his delegations view , the following UNIDO activities should be strengthened : ( a ) attracting foreign investment in the industrial and technological sectors ; ( b ) developing international environmental protection standards for industry ; ( c ) enhancing the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in science and technology and in industry ; ( d ) establishing regional industrial development and ecological production centres ; and ( e ) promoting certification and standardization in industry . 
The access to rights , be they civil and political or economic , social and cultural , by the poor , the excluded and the marginalized has never been easy , with Governments , in the developed and developing world alike , often preferring to respond to the pressures of the more powerful and articulate groups in society rather than to protect the rights of the generally silent and politically weak poor .  
The Office of Operations leads the planning process by providing the overall framework , developing options for courses of action , leading reconnaissance missions to the field and coordinating and integrating inputs from within the Department and from other entities ( e.g . military , police , humanitarian , electoral , human rights and other aspects including logistics , support and staffing requirements ) into a comprehensive plan for approval by the Security Council .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Turning to the question of trade and development , he said that , while trade liberalization was expected to bring about a considerable increase in global income , it must be recognized that , since the early 1970s , the least developed countries had suffered a cumulative decline of 50 per cent in their terms of trade , while the developing countries as a whole had lost $ 290-billion between 1981 and 1991 , which could be attributed to the decline in commodities prices . 
While the developing countries had utilized their own resources in order to achieve the basic objective of sustainable development , it was clear that those efforts would be inadequate without substantial support from the international community .  
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
In order to achieve the goals agreed by both developing and developed countries at the United Nations global conferences , it was necessary to establish an integrated set of indicators against which progress could be evaluated at the policy and operational levels in such areas as poverty , gender equality , environmental sustainability and access to primary health care and primary education .  
In concluding his presentation to the Committee , Mr . Otunnu pointed out that his programme of work for 1999 involved a series of initiatives at the country , regional and international levels which focused on developing public advocacy , strengthening international standards and local values , establishing concrete initiatives in the midst of ongoing conflict , and mobilizing concerted responses to post-conflict needs .  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements .  
The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 10 above and given the urgent need to foster closer cooperation between Governments , United Nations bodies and other international organizations , international financial institutions , in particular the World Bank and the IMF , and non _ governmental organizations on an issue of critical importance to developing countries , particularly least developed and heavily indebted poor countries , the participants agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights :  
In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
In the state policy document on demography and the national programme on improving the status of women , there have been put forward a cluster of objectives to pursue activities aimed at supporting the family well-being , developing a Mongolian family and household study , passing on to the younger generation respect for national traditions , preserving the genetic pool of Mongolians , and preparing children for future independent life , labour , and equal participation of men and women in family .  
At the national level , the causes of poverty in many developing countries included inadequate national economic policies , the insufficiency or lack of a natural resource base and external economic shocks such as external debt , unfavourable terms of trade and reduced official development assistance .  
In order for developing countries to create an environment that would make it possible for everyone to attain quality education , a high standard of health and access to safe water the international community should support all the efforts currently being made by providing additional resources , enhancing debt reduction mechanisms , improving terms of trade and increasing the flow of foreign direct investment .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
The Subcommittee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
It was agreed that the informal consultations between the focal points of small island developing States and prospective donors represented in New York that had been initiated prior to the meeting should continue with a view to discussing the issues raised during the meeting .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
Convinced that the magnitude of current difficulties called for additional measures for resolving the debt problems of the developing countries , Norway had launched a new national strategy which , in addition to supporting and strengthening already existing multilateral schemes , included bilateral debt reduction measures that would be implemented over and above the reductions granted under multilateral operations .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
Since Africa continued to suffer from a heavy external debt burden that contributed to the increase in poverty and affected the political and social sectors , SADC reiterated its call for urgent , effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the problems of external debt and debt servicing in the developing countries .  
To reduce the armaments of others whilst keeping one 's own intact , to reduce the obsolete while developing the state _ of _ the _ art , or even to sacrifice the security of others for one 's own security and to require other countries to scrupulously abide by treaties while giving oneself freedom of action by placing domestic laws above international law : such double standards make a mockery of international disarmament efforts and run counter to the fundamental purposes and objectives of disarmament .  
The 1997 Task Force reported that substantial problems have arisen as a result , and recommended that information centre staff become a communications services group under the resident coordinator , who would be responsible to the head of the Department for developing a plan for how the United Nations global themes can best be adapted and articulated locally ( see report of the Task Force ) .  
With respect to objective No . 2 , namely to attain greater efficiency in international trade and development , particularly that of developing countries , in accordance with national aims of economic and social development and existing economic structures , such as through ( a ) the creation , encouragement and protection of competition ; ( b ) control of concentration of market power ; ( c ) encouragement of innovation , the results have been mixed during the period under review .  
This quite simple backbone or table of contents of issues to consider when drafting a competition law is then complemented in Part II of the Model Law with detailed commentary to the articles , in which a review is made of actual laws in both developed and developing countries , as well as countries in transition , with a view to determining the most recent trends and views on how best to treat each one of the issues considered in the elements for articles of the law contained in Part I .  
The Set also provides for work aimed at achieving common approaches in national policies relating to RBPs compatible with the Set ( article F . 1 ) , and continued work on the elaboration of a model law or laws on RBPs in order to assist developing countries in devising appropriate legislation ( article F . 2 ) ; the OECD instruments do not have such provisions , but the 1998 OECD recommendation recommends convergence in ( as well as effective enforcement of ) laws prohibiting hardcore cartels .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
In addition , in paragraph 25 , the Assembly expressed concern over continued high rates of self-revision during peak workload periods and occasional inadequate translations , which had sometimes hampered the work of delegations , and emphasized the importance of continuous training for all translators at all duty stations and of developing measures to provide translators with increased support from submitting offices and secretariats .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
As far as financing for the implementation of Agenda 21 from countries own public and private sectors is concerned , it may be useful to focus the discussion at the eighth session on the particular problems of developing countries in the current economic situation and continue the discussion held at previous sessions on new policy approaches in both developed and developing countries .  
Despite the fact that the majority of the worlds poor still live in rural areas , the rapid urbanization of the developing world has raised awareness of the problems associated with urban poverty , including increasing levels of slum housing , unprotected and informal employment , street children and child labour , crime , drug abuse and homelessness .  
In the face of acute budgetary constraints in many developing countries and transition economies , intensified by the worldwide financial crisis , efforts to improve financing of the social sector must be seen in the perspective of a host of competing claims upon national treasuries . 
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
It was reported that the average spread on new international bond issues by developing countries ( against United States Treasury bonds of comparable final maturity and coupon ) fell from 355 basis points in 1994 to 258 basis points in the first eight months of 1997 [ 15 ] .  
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
Emphasis will be placed on improving the capacity of the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to integrate them more fully into the regions dynamic development and enhance their participation in international development in the economic and social fields .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,  
South / South cooperation , including TCDC and ECDC , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their more effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system .  
National and bilateral TCDC activities during the reporting period clearly indicate that an increasing number of developing countries are emerging as key proponents of the TCDC process , assuming leadership roles in promoting , organizing and funding bilateral and regional TCDC-related projects as part of their annual commitment to trade , investment and international cooperation activities .  
Among the various configurations of South / South cooperation , the evidence gathered for this report provides incontestable proof that the specific modality of technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) has not only remained in widespread use but has continued to grow in popularity and application among developing country partners .  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .  
In the case of TCDC activities outside the system - i.e . , projects that are initiated , funded and executed in a spontaneous manner between bilateral partners - a parallel increase in the number of participating or beneficiary countries appears to reflect directly the steady improvement of the technical capabilities and funding resources of a growing number of developing countries willing to share their experiences with others .

UNDP support focused on developing the necessary institutional capacities and human resources while the World Bank / GEF provided technical support to stabilizing the environment and improving the management of international waters .  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;

Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
Deeply concerned that , 51 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries in the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries ,

The primary goals of the Conference were to agree on an approach to development that would protect the environment while ensuring economic development , and to lay the foundation for a global partnership between the developing and the more industrialized countries , based on mutual needs and common interests , to ensure a healthy future for the planet .  
With regard to the issues of poverty , economic development and environment , we note with regret that the draft document failed to address the crucial and urgent need to establish better understanding at the international level , and a high level of international cooperation that will enable the developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular to realize success in these fields .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
The Council may also wish to decide that in developing future multi-year work programmes of individual functional commissions , these programmes should be coordinated with those of other functional commissions in such a manner that the themes and issues that will be considered or have been already decided for consideration by these commissions can be addressed from different perspectives in the same calendar year .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Serving as the departmental focal point for developing and coordinating the implementation of global public information strategies and activities to promote special conferences , United Nations decades , international years and other major events relating to the major thematic areas ;  
Rapid advances in technology , growing awareness of the need to preserve Earth and its environment , the increasing potential offered by space activities for economic and social benefits vis - - vis the urgent needs of the developing countries and the changes in the global political scene during the post-cold-war era are sound reasons to deliberate on the role of space in the development of humanity in the twenty-first century .  
In view of the immense potential of space systems to transform societies through distance education and developmental communications , in particular in the developing world , it would be worthwhile to initiate global efforts to create the required awareness among decision makers as well as to ensure effective and synergetic utilization of various space systems in that regard .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Full cognisance should also be taken of the fact that the attainment of the goals and objectives of the ICPD Programme of Action can not be fully realised in the absence of the commitment , as I said earlier , of the international community in other words , in the absence of adequate and additional resources , of the required appropriate technology , of data and material resources coming from the developed to the developing countries , and of full grassroots and civil society participation . 
This revolution is aimed at developing the country 's human resources by ensuring that the education system is relevant and geared to equip students with the requisite knowledge , skills and abilities for sustained , successful living in the twenty-first century .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
On the basis of the Cairo Programme of Action , Benin has developed a strategy we call the common minimum social welfare programme , aimed at improving the quality of life of families and covering a set of basic needs in five essential areas : health , education , food , developing people 's ability to create wealth , and opening up communities . 
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
Despite this unfavourable climate , data indicates that the developing countries have achieved considerable progress towards the goals of the Cairo Conference , although international assistance has fallen well short of the required level .  
The central theme of this review that population concerns are an indispensable part of national and international efforts to achieve equitable , sustained development is particularly relevant to small island developing States , such as Jamaica and many in the Caribbean .  
Since the developing countries constitute the majority of the world population , the successful implementation of the international Programme of Action is quite inconceivable if these serious economic and financial difficulties are not overcome and if the international environment , unfavourable for developing countries , is not rectified .  
From this point of view , we believe it imperative for the international community to facilitate the promotion of a supportive economic environment , particularly for developing countries in their effort to eradicate poverty and achieve sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , as agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development .  
We are also committed to developing cooperation with countries of origin , but we believe that a constructive approach to international migration implies first and foremost the protection of the human rights and dignity of all migrants , irrespective of their legal status , including through the adoption and enforcement of legal instruments , both national and international . 
Despite the fact that it has slowed in many countries , the current rate of demographic growth will , in the coming decades , have a considerable impact on economic , social and even political stability in numerous developing countries which are already enduring serious difficulties .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
It stresses the importance of sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , acknowledging the responsibility of the developed countries in the international pursuit of sustainable development and continued efforts to promote sustained economic growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that can benefit all countries , especially the developing ones .  
While the increased use of advanced electronic communication , including the Internet , was welcomed and supported , views were expressed that , given the level of technological development in developing countries , emphasis should continue to be given to the traditional forms of mass media , including radio , television and print media , in order to reach a wider audience in the developing countries .  
Cuba is aware of the possible dangers attendant upon any use of radioactive waste , which would be tantamount to radiological war , and of the effects of such use on national , regional and international security , and especially the security of the developing countries ; and also of the inherent threat to the preservation of the environment .  
It reports on the ways and means to ensure a better relative balance in the share of technical cooperation activities among the various regions , taking into account their respective needs as well as making maximum use , in the implementation of technical cooperation activities , of existing capacities of developing countries , including local and regional expertise .  
Despite the fact that four years have elapsed since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round , however , agricultural support measures in developed countries , which have been instrumental in their increased shares in agricultural exports and had detrimental impacts on developing countries , have not declined .  " Uruguay Round disciplines were not a constraint for most OECD countries . . . since . . . the current Total Aggregate Measure of Support was well below Uruguay Round commitment levels " [ 8 ] .  
Reaffirms that untied core resources are the bedrock of the operational activities of the United Nations system , and , in this context , calls on Governments to take steps to address the urgent and immediate need for a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , reflecting the increasing needs of developing countries , taking into account the development of multi-year funding frameworks ;  
Concentrations of population in major urban centres ( megacities ) , many of which are located in hazard-prone areas in developing countries , are highly vulnerable to natural and technological hazards due to dependence on complex infrastructures and the occupation of marginal land .  
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
While there is increasing recognition in most developing countries of the need to use such high technology input in support of sustainable development and of developmental activities , interestingly there are two interrelated issues to be addressed : firstly , promoting the technology itself and the associated problems encountered and , secondly , effective utilization of the high technology knowledge , once acquired , for sustainable development activities .  
Given the lack of educated and trained manpower , international efforts are required to ensure that sufficient opportunities are available to developing countries to build their human resource base in different areas of space technology and its applications ;  
As a result , the allocations and expenditures in connection with developing the national economy have fallen below their pre-embargo levels , leading to poorer economic performance , lower available commodities and services required to meet essential needs and a rise in the price of most commodities and services , producing an inflation rate of over 200 per cent .  
In accordance with the objective of health for all , the State spent tremendous sums of money on the health sector with a view to providing a health service for every male and female citizen , without distinction , and developing health services , medicines and free treatment in line with the latest international scientific developments and in quantities and qualities proportionate to the needs of all citizens .  
In order for UNCTAD to make a strong and effective contribution to the process of economic development and enhanced social welfare in the developing countries , it is essential that there be an integrated approach to policy development , recognizing the interrelationships between competition policy and other facets of economic and social policy .  
Today , the most rapidly growing segment of the economy is information : spatial information derived from remote sensing and geographic information systems can help natural resource mangers , in both developed and developing countries , to improve food production and water management , decrease costs or reduce environmental degradation .  
The objectives of UNCTADs technical cooperation activities on competition policy have been pursued with a two-track process that encompasses ( i ) the preparation of a series of briefing papers / notes on key issues / concepts related to competition policy and its development implications ; and ( ii ) informal consensus-building activities in the form of seminars , regional symposiums and other training activities , involving numerous policy makers from developing countries .  
Expressing concern that the world is increasingly being threatened by large-scale natural disasters which will have long _ term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ,  
Recognizing the necessity for the international community to demonstrate the strong political determination required to use existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
The programme that the independent expert is proposing in this paper would be based on international cooperation , in the form of a compact between the donor countries of the OECD , the financial institutions and the concerned developing countries , to realize three basic rights - the right to food , the right to primary health care and the right to primary education - within a specified time period .  
It recognizes that sustained action is required to promote rapid development of developing countries , and then declares : as a complement to the efforts of developing countries , effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .  
The developing countries , lagging far behind the industrial countries in technological and physical capacities , were expected to follow the same path of pursuing accumulation of wealth and production capacities through the growth of gross national product ( GNP ) and expansion of trade and payments .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Conserving the environment , the advent of the information age and continued exploration of the solar system are just some of the important global issues in relation to which space technology can play a leading role in the coming years and many multilateral mechanisms already exist to promote greater international cooperation , in particular with a view to assisting developing countries .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
While welcoming the many spectacular achievements in outer space and space-related activities , the President drew attention to the numerous social and economic challenges that continued to face humankind , particularly in developing countries .  
All representatives endorsed and welcomed the objectives of the Conference , which included promoting the effective means of using space solutions to address problems of regional or global significance ; strengthening the capabilities of Member States , especially developing countries , to use the results of space research for economic and cultural development ; and enhancing international cooperation in space science and technology and its applications . 
Some representatives pointed out that industry in industrialized countries continued to play an active role in developing both new and innovative space applications and technology geared for markets in services in satellite communications , remote sensing and space transportation .  
The academic community has assisted the United Nations human rights machinery by , among other things , developing two sets of guidelines known as the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( 1986 ) , elaborated in 1997 in the Maastricht guidelines on violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
While further developing close cooperation with regional human rights organizations , the Office intends , therefore , to intensify its programme of cooperation at the regional and subregional level , a significant portion of which will focus on economic , social and cultural rights .  
The meeting held a discussion on economic , social and cultural rights and subsequently recommended that the inter-sessional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights should focus , inter alia , on developing quantifiable benchmarks ; identifying obstacles to the realization of these rights ; and proposing relevant actions to strengthen national capacities for the promotion and protection of these rights .  
What links many of these seemingly disparate issues is an often inchoate , but nevertheless palpable , fear on the part of large numbers of thoughtful people , in developing , and developed countries alike , that impersonal forces beyond their control and accountable to no one - distant bureaucracies , mammoth transnational corporations , international organizations meeting behind closed doors - are taking over their lives .  
In short , what we should seek is the virtuous integration of developing countries into a more receptive global system , one which will help them to grow in a steady and socially harmonious way , increasing domestic savings and productivity , diversifying their supply capability , capturing an increasing share of the value-added chain , and incorporating technology .  There can be no denying that a new order of sorts is gradually taking shape .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
The rapid liberalization of financial transactions in developing countries without sufficient prudential regulation was an important element in the onset of the current financial and economic crisis .  
UNCTAD 's future work should aim at improving developing countries understanding of the impact of foreign direct investment , through transnational corporations , on international trade , technology flows , enterprise development and their development prospects generally .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .  
At the inter-agency level , ongoing measures to enhance programme complementarity need to be accompanied by a renewed effort at identifying and focusing on common priority objectives and priority themes ; developing joint arrangements to respond to emerging requirements ; and concerting overall policies and strategies . 
S &amp; amp ; D treatment could focus on specific features of market access , increased productivity , food security , the need to protect small farmers , the special situations of small island developing countries , landlocked countries , small and vulnerable economies and developing countries with large segments of the population dependent on the agricultural sector for employment .  
He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
Despite the declining share of income from the agricultural sector in their gross domestic product ( GDP ) , the sector remained essential for rural development , employment creation , food security and foreign exchange earnings in many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries ( LDCs ) .  
The Food and Agricultural Organization ( FAO ) reported that , based on its ongoing projections of production , trade and consumption to the year 2005 , the agricultural exports of developing countries could become more dynamic in the coming period than in the previous decade .  
For developing countries to achieve the best results from domestic and international agricultural liberalization , for example , they needed to have a stable macroeconomic environment and a basic level of infrastructure ( e.g . transport , storage , communications and finance ) in place .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
SPS measures ) were the main non-tariff barriers to agricultural exports of developing countries , whose protective influence on their exports had been constantly increasing , partly due to growing consumer concerns over food safety in developed countries , but mainly due to the persistent lack of technical capacity of developing country exporters to meet the product requirements in major developed country markets .  
While the transparency commitments made under the SPS Agreement had improved the flow of information on SPS-related regulations of WTO member countries , an application of country-specific SPS requirements beyond what was recommended as an international standard saddled developing country producers and exporters with additional costs to meet disparate SPS measures on the same product in different markets .  
Regarding market price support measures , for instance , in several developing countries the total current AMS , the difference between the administered price and the nominally fixed external reference price ( ERP ) , in domestic currency terms had exceeded its bound level as a result of the high rate of inflation experienced by them in the years since the base period ( 1986-1988 ) .  
As experienced by some developing countries , the calculated product-specific AMS of a market price support measure could become a negative figure when the administered market price dropped below the ERP nominally fixed to the world price in the 1986-1988 base period to meet the objective of supporting food purchases by poor households . 
The common overall objective among developing countries in the next negotiations , experts agreed , was to maximize the potential benefits to developing countries from the continuation of agricultural reform in the multilateral framework by correcting perceived shortcomings of the current Agreement which seemingly put developing countries at a disadvantage in international agricultural trade .  
Others claimed that non-trade concerns of developing countries should be distinguished form those of developed countries , whose interests seemed to be focused on a justification of their continuing use of massive subsidies to the domestic agricultural sector .  
The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
This role may be characterized in very broad terms as ( a ) meeting the rapidly growing demand for energy services in the industrial , transport , commercial , agricultural and household sectors ; ( b ) servicing developing countries rural energy requirements with modern energy carriers ; and ( c ) dealing with environmental problems at various levels .  
Following the World Solar Summit , held at Harare in September 1996 , organized under the guidance of the World Solar Commission , a 10-year programme aimed at the wider use of all sources of environmentally sound , renewable energies , as well as at improving the quality of life , notably in the rural areas of developing countries , was prepared and subsequently approved by the World Solar Commission in June 1997 .  
The first session , devoted to globalization competition and development , reviewed three issues of major importance for developing countries and economies in transition , namely : ( i ) foreign direct ( FDI ) , mergers and alliances ; ( ii ) deregulation , demonopolization and privatization ; and ( iii ) intellectual property rights , competition and transfer of technology .  
The final panel , consisting of key speakers and panellists , reviewed appropriate measures to address the specific needs of developing countries , including the least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and economies in transition , in promoting a competition culture ( at the national level ) and in building a more equitable playing field ( in global markets ) .  
The economic benefits of privatization consisted of improving enterprise efficiency and performance ; developing competitive industry ; accessing capital , know-how and markets ; achieving effective corporate governance ; developing well _ functioning capital markets ; and securing an optional sale price .  
The IGE also reviewed UNCTADs technical assistance activities in developing countries and economies in transition in the course of 1998 , and , acting as a preparatory meeting for the fourth review conference , agreed on a provisional agenda for the conference , to be held in September 2000 .  
Accelerating current initiatives and [ taking / adopting United States ] additional actions to reduce substantially the debts of [ developing countries , particularly United States would delete ] the heavily indebted low-income countries , [ by speeding up the process , by relaxing the eligibility criteria and by broadening and deepening / improving and enhancing existing measures within the current framework of Japan ] the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) initiative ;  
Promoting South-South cooperation , particularly in terms of economic and technical cooperation , and supporting a triangular mechanism whereby donor countries would provide [ financial / appropriate United States ] support for South-South cooperation ; considering the establishment of a generalized trust fund [ supported by voluntary contributions United States ] for triangular economic technical cooperation among developing countries .  
As a multilateral organization with an impressive record of achievements in the industrialization of developing countries and with rich experience in cooperation with the donor countries and international organizations , UNIDO was well qualified to facilitate the flow of resources needed for industrial technical cooperation .  
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
The main objectives outlined in the 1999 consolidated appeal process are to prevent the current humanitarian emergency situation in southern and central Somalia from developing into a dramatic famine , and to continue to foster stability , self-reliance and security in the north .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Encouragement of strategic alliances between research and development institutions and potential technology users to harness the creative capabilities of the scientific communities in the development of new , proven and innovative adaptation strategies and relevant technologies suitable to the particular circumstances of small island developing States , for example , in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities . 
The combination of those three dimensions would be increasingly valuable as electronic commerce moved away from the areas in which it was first developed ( i.e . business-to-consumer and service activities ) to areas in which developing countries had a good chance of building or restoring a competitive advantage ( i.e . business-to-business , commodities , and manufactured and semi-manufactured goods ) .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
The developing economies where 60 per cent of the worlds elderly now live , rising to 70 per cent in 20 years are challenged to develop human and economic capital while strengthening the social capital of family and community security systems .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
Refrain from developing military capacity beyond their legitimate defence requirements , while at the same time reaffirming their resolve to achieve the necessary degree of security and mutual confidence with the lowest possible levels of troops and weaponry , and adhere to the Convention on Chemical Weapons . 12 .  The European Union is convinced that greater transparency in military issues will induce stability at the regional level .  
In this regard , it stressed that the current forms of cooperation involving the public and private sectors of developing countries should be built upon and expanded , and also stressed the importance of identifying barriers and restrictions to the transfer of publicly and privately owned technologies .  
Traditionally , S &amp; amp ; T policies and institutions ( e.g . national laboratories , university research institutes and technical standards bodies ) have aimed at the generation of new knowledge , but for many developing countries the main priorities are the transfer and diffusion of existing technology , the building of technological capabilities of productive enterprises , and fostering their capacity to innovate and compete in the global economy .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
A joint study was entitled Strengthening the participation of developing countries in world trade and the multilateral trading system was carried out in 1996 , which included sections on improving market access in commercial services and improving the domestic supply response .  
In the environmental services sector , foreign suppliers can make a positive contribution to the protection of the environment if technically adequate , enforceable legislation is in place , and obviously if the developing country concerned can afford to pay for such imported services .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
They highlighted the disadvantages that derive from their location and physical characteristics dispersion of islands over large areas in the case of archipelagic small island developing States ; recurrent damages inflicted on small island developing States located in the cyclonic belt by natural disasters , such as hurricanes ; overuse , rapid depletion and degradation of natural resources on account of their paucity relative to the demand for them .  
A permanent regional coordination mechanism in each region could provide much needed support for identifying realistic areas of cooperation , formulating regional cooperation plans , coordinating among small island developing States to implement plans , and providing technical support to small island developing States in negotiating international treaties and participating effectively in international negotiations .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
In this context , it was observed that there is a positive correlation between the level of external assistance and the level of foreign direct investment in small island developing States ; high levels of external assistance serve to reduce the perceived risks of investing in small island developing States and attract high levels of foreign direct investment .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
It was agreed that the informal consultations between the focal points of small island developing States and prospective donors represented in New York that had been initiated prior to the meeting should continue with a view to discussing the issues raised during the meeting .  
More generally , small island developing States believe that the potential for greater resource mobilization can be enhanced by more effective coordination on a number of fronts : at the national and regional levels , including a strengthened regional mechanism ; among donors , through more creative interaction with the private sector and NGOs ; and through the strengthening of focal points within the United Nations system , including the small island developing States Unit .  
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
Other areas of concern to developing countries relate to the proof of sound scientific evidence of their own sanitary and phytosanitary measures , market access restrictions resulting from pests and diseases existing elsewhere in the country concerned ( but not in the region of the exporter ) or , more generally , the potential trade and / or economic impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers applied against their exports .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .  
Ways should be found to enable developing countries to participate more effectively in the formulation of international standards , a very costly process , and gain access to mutual recognition agreements concluded progressively among developed countries ( and which discriminate against developing countries ) , as well as to meet sanitary and phytosanitary regulations .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita income with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
There can be little question that the increased interdependence of developed and developing countries has made trade and finance two key areas in which the introduction of coherent and complementary policies can help to achieve the maximum benefits of global growth and development .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) and geographical constraints , such as being landlocked and lacking good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
UNESCO has been invited to be represented at the first international seminar on traditional carpets and kilims in the Muslim world : past , present and future prospects for developing this heritage with the continuous changes of the market , design , quality and applied techniques ( Tunisia , October 1999 ) .  
The Agency noted moreover that one of the major objectives of the physical protection activities is to convey a basic understanding of the need to protect nuclear materials and of the tools necessary for developing and operating a national physical protection system .  
Following the rejection of the constitutional reforms in the national referendum on 16 May , the Follow-up Commission , a body established under the peace agreements with the authority to reschedule the parties commitments , has dedicated its attention to developing a viable peace agenda , which would enable the completion of the third phase of the timetable , in consultation with those sectors of civil society that are directly involved in the implementation process .  
In addition to cash transfers for destitute families and children , the chronic sick , elderly and unemployed , assistance should be provided for developing capacities through the provision of basic services , skill training and retraining for the changing employment and market demand , micro-credit facilities , and other productive assets to help to broaden the income support base for the poor and vulnerable groups ;  
In addition , research infrastructures should be strengthened in order to reinforce national capacities to understand the root causes of poverty , collect data , measure and assess its extent in specific economic and sociocultural contexts , as a basis for developing , implementing and evaluating effective policies .  
Regional economic and social commissions should become better skilled at developing non-governmental organization relations at the regional and national levels , with a view to constructing policy and operational partnerships at those levels in implementing United Nations decisions and programmes as well as outcomes of international conferences ;  
Non-physical barriers , notably inefficient and limited choice of transport organizations , poor utilization of assets , government controls and cumbersome transit procedures , contributed to high unit costs of transport and insurance and long transit times .  He noted that the specific needs and problems of landlocked developing countries varied from one region to another .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries , long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations , was the lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
For example , the ability of developing countries to achieve their growth potential , to close the gap in per capita incomes with the developed world and to maintain macroeconomic stability is significantly determined by macroeconomic policies pursued by the major industrial countries .  
Moreover , many developing countries are particularly vulnerable to unfavourable changes in external economic conditions owing to the small size of their economies , their specialization in a limited number of export products ( usually primary commodities ) , and geographical constraints and lack of good access to the physical facilities required for international trade .  
The asymmetric distribution of benefits and risks arising from globalization warrants a global social contract between developing and developed countries , based on genuine solidarity and shared responsibility and with the active involvement of non-State stakeholders with a view to creating a rule-based international system where all countries could take full advantage of the process and where the stronger countries recognize and respect the constraints of the weaker ones .  
In light of the foregoing , KFOR , in close consultation with my Special Representative , is developing a concept for demobilization of the KLA , offering individual members an opportunity to participate in a disciplined , professional , multi-ethnic civilian emergency corps .  
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
Poland expressed the view that the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States constitutes a positive step towards the implementation of the provisions of Articles 49 and 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
It considers that the summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting on developing a methodology for assessing the consequences incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures and on exploring innovative and practical measures of international assistance to the affected third States represents an important contribution to the constructive application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations .  
These are reflected in initiatives undertaken by UNIDO for the planned subregional forums and the upgrading of certain national UNIDO country offices to regional offices , with a view to developing regional integrated programmes to address the special economic problems of the affected countries .  
They also stressed the importance of sound domestic policies , private capital flows and appropriate functioning of markets , as well as a favourable and open international economic environment , to overcome this crisis and reverse the marginalization of some developing countries , in particular the least developed ones .  
The initiative in Azerbaijan directs special attention to promotion of economic opportunities among young disabled adults by training in selected commercial services to meet the demands of its developing economy .  
With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based on global market forces would be more rapid , more sustainable and more widely shared than in the past , allowing developing countries to narrow the gap with industrial countries and the poorest sections of society to close the income gap with the rich . 
At the start of a new millennium , therefore , a fundamental challenge for the international community is to enhance the coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies at the intergovernmental level and at the level of international institutions , as well as to implement concrete measures and initiatives designed to secure the integration of developing countries into the globalizing world economy on an equitable basis .  
The mobilization of external resources for development in the 1990s has been characterized by an increasing privatization of resource flows to some developing countries , which results in a dichotomy between the small number of middle-income countries having access to international capital markets and the large remaining majority of developing countries having to rely on dwindling sources of official finance .  
In the area of the mobilization of external resources for development , the challenges ahead include the following : mobilizing enhanced and more stable sources of international investment flows towards a larger number of recipient developing countries ; strengthening international cooperation aimed at a reversal of the decline in ODA ; and finding lasting solutions to the debt problems of developing countries .  
On the one hand , the multilateral framework of WTO rules has in certain cases narrowed the range of policy options for Governments : quantitative tools of protection are now largely ruled out , including production allocations and similar means ; tariffs are increasingly subject to binding commitments ; the transition period for national content and trade balancing requirements lapses at the end of 1999 ; and export subsidies will no longer be permitted for most developing countries after 2003 .  
C Agriculture combines the most severe handicaps for developing country exporters : extremely high peak tariffs for major food products ; complex tariff structures ; protective measures under the agricultural safeguard clause ; biased implementation of tariff quotas ; extremely high levels of export , production and investment subsidies in developed countries ; and import prohibitions for health and sanitary reasons which are applied differentially against developing countries ' exports .  
Widening gaps between developing country export performance and international competitiveness call for stronger emphasis on direct policy action in respect of structural production and investment conditions and reinforced international support .  Price and preferential incentives alone have not brought about a broad turnaround where the production basis was not sufficiently developed for progress to be made towards exporting to major developed country markets .  
A new potential is growing in certain developing countries as they become major foreign investors and major manufacturers and exporters in industries which now use textile fibres and raw materials previously imported from developed country industries .  
Customs have a critical influence on development through the four major tasks they perform : ( 1 ) they are the physical " contact point " between the global and the national economy ; ( 2 ) they collect duties which represent a sizeable part of government revenue in developing countries ; ( 3 ) they are essential in the fight against the traffic in illegal products ; and ( 4 ) they gather trade statistics which are vital for policy-making .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
C Analysing the impact , both positive and negative , of substantial reduction or elimination of export subsidies on developing countries , with particular attention being paid to the special concerns of LDCs , net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) and other small and vulnerable economies .  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Since ideology and determination alone could not secure social development in developing countries , there must be an effort during the special session to strengthen international partnerships with a view to mobilizing the necessary financial assistance , technical know-how and human resources .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating once and for all the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of developing countries on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach ,  
Stressing also the need for a supportive international economic environment that is conducive to improving the developing countries terms of trade , market access and access to technology , as well as to fostering better commodity prices , stable exchange rates and international interest rates and to enabling the provision of sufficient resources for development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Recognizing also that globalization poses severe challenges and risks , particularly for developing countries , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts towards achieving sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards realizing the objective of eradicating poverty ,  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
Urges concerned Governments , particularly the countries of origin and destination , to further strengthen their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States ;  
While reaffirming that all Member States were legally obligated to pay their contributions and arrears in accordance with the Charter , he recognized the need to extend sympathetic understanding to developing countries that were temporarily unable to meet those obligations because of genuine economic difficulties .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to increase allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Developed countries should energetically pursue economic policies conducive to the healthy long-term development of all countries and cooperate actively with developing countries in formulating effective policy measures at both the national and the international level .  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
The progressive integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system will depend not only on the success of their domestic reforms and on the competitiveness of their economies , but also on the capacity of this system to appropriately address and take into account the specific economic and social capacities and constraints of these countries and , in particular , of the least developed among them .  
It is therefore important that developing countries , when implementing economic reforms , increasing export competitiveness and building a favourable investment climate , are placed in a position that allows them to carry out such tax , social , environmental and regulatory policies , which are critical in terms of sustainable development .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
In this context , increased win-win research into the potential to yield both direct economic benefits and positive environmental results for developing countries would be of specific importance .  
Norwegian support of private sector development in developing countries was aimed at increasing income for individuals , providing jobs for poor groups , and raising tax revenues so as to create the necessary economic base for a rise in domestic investment .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life , and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries , and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .  
The studies covered such areas as the update of the Trade Policy Simulation econometric model , assistance in positive agenda formulation for developing countries , assessment of the quantitative impact of multilateral trade negotiations on developing countries , implementation of the Anti-Dumping Agreement and the required improvements thereto .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Any other group or delegation was also free to enrich the debate , bearing in mind the spirit of the report of the Secretary-General of UNCTAD to UNCTAD X . All of that work had been conducted , not in a spirit of sterile confrontation based on abstract principles , but out of a concern to do as much as possible , within the framework of the competences of UNCTAD , to improve the standard of living of people in developing countries . 
The Ministers at Marrakech had also agreed to transmit a message to the WTO Conference in Seattle , demonstrating the G-77s determination to ensure that future multilateral trade initiatives would be focused on achieving a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the global trading system , improving conditions of access for developing country products and services in world markets and correcting imbalances in rights and obligations .  
It had also stressed the need for solidarity in combating poverty and identified the urgent task of strengthening UNCTADs role as an appropriate forum for analysing and designing development strategies that promoted economic growth and social development while contributing to the growth of all developing countries .  
General Assembly resolution 53 / 175 stressed the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment ( preambular para . 12 ) and the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth ( para .  9 ) .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
In general , however , the current international situation was propitious for enhanced economic cooperation between nations and a more determined effort to eliminate the many obstacles still standing in the way of the growth and progress of the developing countries .  
In the area of international trade , he expressed his delegations concern at the fate of major export commodities , such as sugar , after the Lom Convention expired in the coming months and urged WTO to establish specific criteria for the special and preferential treatment of developing countries .  
The specific commitments from developing countries and the donor community to expand basic social services called for at the international meeting on the 20 / 20 initiative held at Hanoi were essential to realizing the goals set at Beijing and Cairo .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
Those overall trends masked the serious debt problems faced by the heavily indebted poor countries and the fact that a growing number of middle-income developing countries had experienced serious payments problems , aggravated by the contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis ( A / 54 / 370 , paras . 3 to 5 ) .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
The international business community must become more actively involved in poverty reduction efforts through increased foreign direct investment ( FDI ) to developing countries , particularly the least developed countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; the prevention of systemic capital market instability ; the development of ethical trade and business principles ; and practices that were in conformity with the standards of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Along with domestic efforts , the international environment must also be improved , as it could have a direct impact on developing countries , which were fragile and especially vulnerable to external blows .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
In crisis-affected countries and marginalized economies in developing regions , where the situation of the working poor was further aggravated by the negative impact of globalization and neoliberal policies , it was vital to protect employment opportunities and to maintain an adequate social safety net .  
In furtherance of the aims of the World Programme of Action concerning disabled persons , ILO was seeking to equalize employment opportunities for persons with disabilities , by advising member States on developing appropriate legislative and institutional frameworks based on its Conventions , building a supportive environment for the social and economic integration of disabled persons , as well as a code of practice on managing disability and related matters in the workplace .  
To overcome the difficulties of living in a small island developing State where the main services and activities were concentrated in only two urban centres , the country had established a mobile team for community development to provide outlying communities with information on nutrition and population issues .  
In particular , small island developing States such as Fiji could not receive an equitable share of the benefits of the global trading system without improved market access , special and differential treatment of their products and enhanced institutional capacity to make the most of global trading opportunities .  
Among the social and economic measures and policies aimed at developing its human resources , the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya provided education to all free of charge until completion of the elementary level , free health services , and free social security services for widows , disabled persons and the elderly .  
The problem needed to be addressed nationally , by supporting the private and informal sectors , promoting self-employment , providing credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations and investing in training programmes ; internationally , by dismantling trade barriers , ensuring adequate capital flows to developing nations , encouraging technology transfer , alleviating the debt burden and sharing experiences .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development ;  
India had recognized the crucial importance of science and technology as the determinant of long-term growth , and its booming software industry reflected the potential that sector held for developing countries .  
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .  
It had also urged Governments and the private sector to increase their support for developing an adequate science and technology capacity through appropriate education and research programmes as an indispensable foundation for economic , social , cultural and environmentally sound development .  
In the modern world , the development of national scientific and technological capacities was essential for increasing the competitiveness of the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition and ensuring their real integration into the world economic system .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs and , in this connection , may seek assistance from the international community and UNCTAD in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in regional / subregional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
The international community must also provide support to enable countries to overcome factors impeding full implementation of Beijing goals ; accordingly , the preparatory committee for the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly should address the related issues of resource mobilization , support for structural adjustment , improved market access for developing countries , exchange of technologies and know-how ( the provision of grants for training ) , and development cooperation .  
Recognizing also that globalization poses severe challenges and risks , particularly for developing countries , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts towards achieving sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards realizing the objective of eradicating poverty ,  
Recognizing that , while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty through the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with a long-term perspective ,  
Mr . Cabactulan ( Philippines ) said that more work was needed on the terms of reference for the Panel of Experts on Access and Benefit Sharing in order to ensure that the biological diversity within countries was carefully protected , while at the same time ensuring that such resources were utilized in a manner that fully respected the proprietary rights of indigenous communities and enabled the original developers in developing countries to share the benefits .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
On one of the current sticking points the transboundary movement of living modified organisms intended for consumption or transformation her Government advocated a differentiated solution taking account of the constraints of the international market and the particular situation of developing countries .  
It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
Singapores three-year technical assistance programme for sustainable development which was intended to help developing countries through the provision of training in areas such as urban environmental management , environmental technology , solid waste management , water supply engineering , urban planning and transport management , had so far benefitted more than 1,000 people from 80 countries .  
As far as trade and finance was concerned , the forthcoming round of trade negotiations in the context of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) should be comprehensive and move the process of trade liberalization forward , strengthen the framework for the functioning of the multilateral trading system and ensure that the particular interests and concerns of developing countries were taken into account .  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries . 
The vast , cheap labour pools of developing countries were being exploited , commodity prices were being manipulated in order to ensure a continued supply of cheap raw materials and the markets of developing countries were being pried open in the name of trade liberalization while the developed countries limited access to their own markets through various stratagems .  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
More coherent policies , established on the basis of broad consensus , should be developed , bearing in mind the need to respect the principle of sovereignty and to ensure flexibility in the policies affecting developing countries , particularly in areas such as the management of capital flows and the choice of capital account regime .  
Capital movements had played a large part in the recent financial crises , and developing countries must honestly evaluate whether their economic policies were adequate to face the challenges of the abrupt demographic , economic and technological changes resulting from globalization .  
Among the obstacles faced by developing countries were the current lack of infrastructure in the domestic and global economies and the instability of capital markets , the fall in the price of raw materials , debt burdens , lack of investment , uncontrolled exchange rates and social resistance .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financing environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures particularly adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Good governance and transparency , good management of the State and financial and social policies should include : developing strategies for meeting the basic needs of the community , such as access to credit , in particular for women workers in the informal sector ; popular participation in decisions concerning the community ; equal opportunities in the competitive market economy and accountability in regard to the use of multilateral and bilateral financial aid .  
Notes with appreciation the positive contributions the Fund and its dedicated staff have made during its thirty years in promoting better understanding and awareness of population and development issues , in improving the quality of human life and in extending systematic and sustained assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request , in undertaking appropriate national programmes to address their population and development needs .  
The creation of conditions that will enable developing countries and their media , public , private or other , to have , by using their national and regional resources , the communication technology suited to their national needs , as well as the necessary programme material , especially for radio and television broadcasting ;  
Acutely aware of its ad hoc and temporary nature , the Mission has been pursuing a three-pronged exit strategy : strengthening the state institutions responsible for ensuring respect for human rights , reinforcing the capacity of civil society organizations and the media in the area of human rights monitoring and investigation and developing a body of documents , studies and data on key institutions and human rights issues which have been made public .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls upon all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
Legislative acts adopted in recent years would make it possible to define the legal field for developing traditional types of economic activity as a basis for ensuring the viability of small indigenous peoples , developing local self-government and establishing relations based on partnership with governmental bodies at various levels .  
For many commodities exported by developing countries , there has also been substantial substitution by synthetic materials over the past two decades , while a shift away from traditional &amp; lt ; heavy = industries , such as iron and steel , has also limited the rate of expansion in demand for natural raw materials .  
If world commodity markets are left to the &amp; lt ; free play of market forces = , while much high-cost agriculture in developed countries - - even after the Uruguay Round - - continues to be subsidized , the underlying problem of the downward trend in real prices of commodities exported by developing countries is likely to persist .  
The Seattle Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization and the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , to be held at Bangkok , should reassert the continuing need for differential treatment for developing countries and , because there was no one valid model of behaviour , the need for national autonomy .  
Globalization should therefore be re-examined from four broad perspectives : democratization of international economic decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues by international institutions ; reform of the international financial architecture ; and effective action against the marginalization of developing countries .  
The current initiative , however , had alleviated only a small part of the debt of a limited number of countries and she therefore welcomed the progress achieved at the recent annual meeting of the World Bank and IMF to achieve dramatic cuts in the debt burden of the heavily indebted developing countries , linking those cuts to poverty reduction strategies . 
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
In recognition of the crushing burden that external debt placed on developing nations and the resultant inability of those countries to attend to social and environmental issues , the Initiative used debt relief as an instrument for resolving many of the social and developmental problems faced by such countries .  
Mr . Sharma ( India ) said , in reviewing the world economic situation , that in the late 1980s and early 1990s globalization , liberalization and rapid technological change had seemingly held out to humanity the promise of historic change , a promise of fresh opportunities , as the developing countries increasingly participated in the growth of the world economy , to improve living standards and secure a brighter future for millions mired in poverty and underdevelopment .  
The rapid growth of capital markets and financial liberalization was the other key pillar of globalization which had been projected as providing a definitive solution to the resources constraint that developing countries had traditionally faced .  
Pakistan was concerned by the reference in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( A / 54 / 36 , para . 60 ) to the fact that the Working Group on Common Indicators , established by the United Nations Development Group , was developing civil and political rights indicators to complement existing economic and social indicators .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
While his delegation fully supported the use of measures to encourage the timely , full and unconditional payment of assessed contributions , it was concerned that the effect of those outlined in the report might be the opposite of what was intended and that they might penalize a number of developing countries .  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , including through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Policy makers in other developing countries were encouraged by the international media to read the lesson of the Asian crisis , not as a cautionary tale about the dangers of opening capital markets without first developing the appropriate regulatory apparatus , but rather as evidence that State involvement in economic governance should be reduced . 
The idea that the political leaders of developing countries might be able to make use of the WTO to advance shared interests is radical , but the idea that civil society might find in the WTO a vehicle for pursuing interests , which are defined socially rather than nationally , is even more so .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;

Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;

The manual , which will cover independent time-use surveys and multi-purpose surveys , and will highlight the special issues raised by those surveys in developing countries , will be based on ongoing national work and pilot studies supported by the project . 
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
17 .  Reiterates its request to the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to ensure that the separate identity of the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries is maintained and that its programme is adequately funded at a level commensurate with its mandate and system-wide responsibilities in promoting , monitoring and coordinating technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Calls upon all Governments and all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative , administrative and economic measures , policies and practices of a coercive nature against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing countries , which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights ,  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Reaffirms that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Notes with appreciation that some affected developing countries and one region have adopted their national and regional action programmes , and therefore calls upon the international community to contribute to the implementation of those programmes through , inter alia , the conclusion of partnership agreements , relevant bilateral and multilateral cooperation programmes that are available to implement the Convention and contributions from non-governmental organizations and the private sector ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
While developed countries had remained relatively unscathed by the recent financial crisis , in developing countries the gains of decades of economic and social progress had been erased overnight and millions had been thrown back into poverty .  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The development of the developing countries was hampered by a debt burden equivalent to a huge proportion of their export revenues ( over 50 per cent in Latin America and nearly 30 per cent in Africa ) and by protectionism ; rigid quality standards that were difficult to meet ; and falling commodity prices .  
The economic sanctions that the Security Council imposes on a number of countries , usually developing countries , and unilateral coercive measures are significant factors that halt the realization of the right to development , cause material and human losses in the development process and require many years to offset , particularly if such economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council continue for a long and indefinite period of time .  
Current international economic relations , being based on a unipolar policy and attempts by many wealthy States to impose an economic system or systems at the international level solely with a view to furthering their own interests , cause severe economic crises in the developing countries and are highly detrimental to the realization of the right to development .  
The problem of external debt , structural adjustment programmes , economic globalization , unequal access to commercial markets , the collapse of basic commodity prices and speculation in hard currencies are obstacles to development and are detrimental not only to the political independence of developing countries but also to their economic and development policies and their ability to forecast the evolution of their economic situation at the national and international levels .  
A key question for UNCTAD to consider is : can the barriers to international trade in agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough to enable a poverty reduction strategy for the rural developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm employment rather than on a heavy reliance on social programmes and social safety net ?  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Can the barriers to international trade for agriculture and agro-industrial products be reduced far enough and fast enough for a poverty reduction strategy for rural areas of the developing world to be based primarily on agricultural growth and rural non-farm activities rather than on social programmes and safety nets ?  
The primary components of the draft sustainable energy and climate change strategy include : promoting strategic innovations in the delivery of sustainable energy services in rural areas of developing countries ; increasing the use of market-based policies to achieve climate change objectives ; and encouraging the participation of developing countries in climate change negotiations by promoting their capacity to identify , negotiate and implement key issues .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries as constituting an element adversely affecting their development efforts and economic growth , and stressing the importance of alleviating once and for all the onerous debt and debt-service burdens connected with the various types of debt of developing countries on the basis of an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable approach ,  
Stressing also the need for a supportive international economic environment that is conducive to improving the developing countries terms of trade , market access and access to technology , as well as to fostering better commodity prices , stable exchange rates and international interest rates and to enabling the provision of sufficient resources for development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
The voluminous documentation on international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space that had been submitted to the Conference established the basis for the use of space for the purpose of environmental protection ; the rational utilization of natural resources ; the promotion of development ; education ; and the broader application of space technology in the interests of developing countries .  
UNISPACE III , which had taken place in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and the exhibition of space science and technology organized in parallel with that event , had given the participants an opportunity to evaluate the current state of international cooperation in the exploration and peaceful uses of outer space and to consider ways and means of further developing the respective programmes and strategies with which humankind would enter the twenty-first century .  
Representatives of intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and scientific institutions in the field of outer space participating in the conference had had an opportunity to exchange views and make constructive proposals on ways and means to strengthen the regime for the peaceful uses of outer space , develop international cooperation and increase the potential of States , especially developing countries , to use scientific achievements to promote the development process .  
The benefits of space exploration should not be available only to those countries which possessed advanced technology ; international cooperation in that area was required , first of all to meet the requirements of developing countries , since the appropriate use of outer space could open broad possibilities for ensuring the sustainable economic development of all countries .  
Socialism had different related meanings : it represented an intellectual trend based on the critique of the developing bourgeois society ; it was the expression of a political and social movement aiming at reforms , influence or power ; and it referred to an ideal economic and social system intended to replace and overcome capitalism and its perceived flaws .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasising also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
At the 42nd meeting , on 18 November , the representative of Guyana , on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 77 and China and Mexico , introduced a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable and equitable international financial system , responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 ) , which read : The General Assembly ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing decline in official development assistance , which is a significant external source of financing for development and an important support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Mindful of the need that the benefits of the increasing integration of global markets should be extended to all nations and peoples , in particular to the developing countries , especially the least developed among them , that in spite of the important role of private capital flows for promoting economic development they are not evenly distributed , and that for the majority of developing countries they are unavailable or inadequate ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
At the 49th meeting , on 14 December , the Vice-Chairman of the Committee , Giovanni Brauzzi ( Italy ) , introduced , a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 72 ) , which he submitted on the basis of informal consultations held on draft resolution A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 . 
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may be either inadequate or unavailable ,  
Encourages Governments , multilateral institutions and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international business activities , to strengthen partnerships so as to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows , particularly in support of the development efforts of developing countries , as well as countries with economies in transition ;  
Urges all Governments to create an enabling environment for business and investment , including through sound macroeconomic , fiscal and development policies , the rule of law , anti-corruption and anti-bribery efforts , and transparent business practices that promote efficiency , fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions , taking into account the needs of developing countries ;  
The current environment , driven by free market forces and unpredictable capital fluctuations had been favourable to countries which benefited from sound economic conditions , technology and capital but unfavourable to the majority of developing countries which were relatively uncompetitive and marginalized .  
In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
The economic weaknesses of small island developing States were well known : narrow economic base , low levels of diversification , heavy dependence on external trade ; shortage of skilled manpower ; and the brain drain .  
India continued to believe that there was an urgent need for developing countries , with the assistance of the international community , to implement programmes which ensured a level of consumption for their citizens , especially the poor and disadvantaged , that met their basic needs .  
The first principle was the necessity to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful uses and to promote international cooperation in the use of outer space for such purposes , taking into account the imperative of achieving continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries .  
Mr . Rayani ( Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ) said that UNISPACE III had emphasized the importance of providing the developing countries with opportunities to use the latest achievements of space science and technology for the purposes of economic development and for forecasting natural disasters , especially since outer space was not the exclusive property of any individual State but the common heritage of mankind .  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
The effect on developing countries includes reduced economic investments , more decaying neighbourhoods and fewer government resources allotted to essential social development programmes such as education , health and programmes promoting gender and ethnic equality .  
The Government stressed that the people of the South required reparation and justice for impunity , neo-colonial wars , the extermination of populations and peoples , the defilement of their economic , cultural and natural heritage by countries of the North , the decapitalization of the developing countries charged with paying external debts and the dumping of toxic waste in their territories , to cite only a few examples .  
Plays an active role in developing and facilitating consultations with Governments , including through permanent missions accredited to UNEP in Nairobi , leading to better understanding of Governments expectations and environmental needs , and keeps Governments informed of UNEPs ongoing activities and plans ;  
It was therefore important to reinforce regional and international cooperation in combating drugs and essential to assist developing countries whether drug producing or otherwise in the administrative , judicial , economic and social areas , among other things by sharing information on investigation techniques , crop substitution , detoxification and reintegration of drug addicts into society .  
As some city groups had been very active in developing further the conceptual and methodological thinking in many areas of economic statistics , ISWGNA decided to seek the dialogue with those city groups whose work was related to the area of national accounting .  
The failure of the international community to prevent such massive suffering in the half century since the trials in Tokyo and Nuremberg makes tragically clear the urgency of developing comprehensive measures for combating impunity as well as strong and effective early-warning and conflict-prevention measures to prevent genocide .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
During the past four years under Mr . Ricupero ' s stewardship , UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy , participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations , predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment.He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries .  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45-72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Use of ODA for reinforcing developing countries potential for better access to global markets , and poverty eradication , leveraging larger levels of domestic or foreign private capital ;  
The Office will start consultations with African States in the near future on developing a framework for regional human rights cooperation in Africa that would be based on continued support by the Office to OAU regional and subregional initiatives , as well as on activities at the national level in the four areas referred to above .  
Less visible but nonetheless destructive violations of human rights are the growth of poverty in rich and developing countries alike , and the marginalization caused by violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The Dominican Republic is convinced that reform of the Security Council must be carried out in keeping with the principles of equitable geographical distribution and the equal sovereignty of Member States , since no reform will be acceptable if it leads to discriminatory treatment of developing nations by developed nations .  
I call upon every Member State , large and small , developed and developing , rich and poor , to work cooperatively to find meaningful solutions and preventive actions for this growing international problem and challenge .  
If the advocates of market theories and globalization , and their political leaders , were to recognize that at present the poor are becoming poorer while the rich become richer and that the gap between developing and developed countries is becoming wider in every area whether in the economic , commercial , technical , health or environmental spheres an element of pessimism would , unfortunately , mar the feeling of optimism with which we hope to welcome the dawn of the twenty-first century .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
Much has changed since the World Assembly on Ageing , which was held in Vienna in 1982 , when it was first acknowledged in an important international forum that the ageing of the population was not confined to the industrialized world but was actually going to have its greatest impact in our developing countries .  
Coupled with the adverse effects of widespread and pervasive poverty , the phenomenon of ageing will have far-reaching implications for the efforts of developing countries to achieve the sustained economic growth and social development which are fundamental for ensuring a better quality of life for the entire population .  
The eradication of poverty remains the foremost challenge for the developing world , where policy makers struggle on a daily basis to respond to the most basic needs of their peoples despite dwindling financial resources , disappointing economic growth rates and their countries growing marginalization in the worlds economy .  
The Report estimates that developing countries have lost four times as much due to the protectionism of developed countries as they have received through private capital inflows a key negative equation considering that trade earnings are much needed incomes to back production and employment , while capital inflows are monies to be repaid with interest .  
How can we move beyond the Copenhagen commitments when official development assistance has declined to a meagre 0.22 per cent , when assistance to developing countries is increasingly conditional , and when developing countries are prescribed structural adjustment programmes and prescriptions that take no account of social priorities or national characteristics ?  
For the developing and least developed countries , the continuous fall of official development assistance , piling up of external debt , decline in their ability to get access to the global market for their limited exports , plus new conditionalities on export opportunities have aggravated their multifaceted constraints .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
An internationally concerted framework for improving early warning by developing concrete proposals for an effective international mechanism , including the transfer of technology to developing countries , under the auspices of the United Nations as part of the implementation of related actions of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction , should be established .  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
While emphasizing the imperative need for the political will on the part of States to facilitate the access of needy populations to assistance and cooperation , it seems to us equally valuable that the Secretary-General has included , as the first point in his annual report , a reference to the importance of developing a culture of prevention to deal with natural disasters . 
In addition , the enormous force of globalization , driven by the advancement of science and technology , instead of serving to unify humankind in a determined and conscious assault against the persistent and systemic problems of our time , is continuously being used to press the advantage of the strong over the weak , and is thereby widening the gap between the developed and the developing worlds .  
However , the full knowledge of the advantages of nuclear energy and of the economic and social situation of most countries , in particular of the developing countries , has not prevented some developed countries from maintaining attitudes counter to the objectives of the IAEA trying to cut technical assistance programmes , decreasing their contributions to the fund created for such purposes or selectively putting conditions on the funds use .  
In developing countries , atomic energy with its multiple applications in power generation , improving health standards , enhancing the quality and quantity of agricultural yields , pest controls and water resources management is seen as the key to a better future .  
Without denying the importance of developing renewable power sources , we should admit that at present the only realistic industrial-scale solution to this problem is to intensify efforts to develop a safe , environmentally acceptable and economically attractive nuclear power sector.Will the nuclear power industry be equal to a task of this magnitude ?  
That it is directed against a poor and small developing country that poses no threat to its mighty neighbour is particularly dismaying , especially when the United States considers itself a champion and promoter of global free trade , in which capital and goods should be able to move freely across national borders without unnecessary impediment .  
Once again , we call for developing countries to be able to participate on an equal footing with developed countries in the codification and gradual development of international law as an essential premise for establishing a just and equitable international legal order in the next century.The meeting rose at 1.15 p.m .  
Faced with adverse and sometimes extreme conditions whose horrors the modern media flash instantaneously into all our households , and when the response capability of countries , particularly of the developing countries , is diminished or significantly undermined , mankind suddenly seems reconciled , empathetic and unified ; and from that perspective , humanitarian assistance provided by the United Nations is beneficial and of great value to stricken populations . 
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
Indeed , it is in the best interest of the process that the procedural issues pertaining to the meetings be carried out in a swift and prudent manner to allow the actual meeting period to be dedicated to more substantive work.We further support the notion reflected in the draft resolution that , with regard to the appointment of the co-chairpersons , there needs to be representation from both developed and developing countries .  
The current economic world situation is a cause for great concern for developing countries , and it is vital to seek and to foster new forms of international economic cooperation based on a partnership with reciprocal gains for all the participants .  
Today , as we look back , we can see that what we have achieved in Mongolia over the past decade in building the institutions of democracy , promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms , unleashing private initiative and developing our external relations has constituted a major advance towards a self-governing democratic society , a private-sector-led economy and a closer association with the rest of the international community .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
This stage , of course , is fraught with risks and potential setbacks , especially in developing countries , due to the lack of essential conditions for pursuing a democratic course , foremost among them the existence of an economic system that meets the basic living and cultural needs of a society , in addition to the rule of law and the existence of a civil society that is robust with political and professional activities .  
At the same time , it is astonishing that a regime that has a dark record of developing , producing and stockpiling many inhumane kinds of weapons of mass destruction ventures to accuse a country that is among those in the Middle East that have joined the most basic international instruments in effect in the field of disarmament .  
While the United Nations has created a judicial affairs office that deals with the court system , the prosecution service and the correctional system in Kosovo , the OSCE Rule of Law Division which is part of the Rule of Law and Human Rights Department is tasked with developing mechanisms to ensure that the police , courts , administrative structures and other judicial structures are operating in accordance with international standards of criminal justice and human rights .  
However , many developing countries in Asia , Africa and Latin America , which experienced the colonial rule of foreign forces in the past , have lost numerous items of cultural property as a result of looting and destruction by colonialists , and have faced serious problems in the continuation of national tradition and the systemic development of national culture .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
In short , Lithuania , inter alia , supports these elements : a Security Council enlarged to around 24 members , enlargement in both categories , new permanent seats for industrialized and developing countries , regional rotation for those regions that agree on the concept , effective review , further and constant democratization and transparentization of the Security Council ' s methods of work , and the curtailment and eventual abolition of the veto .  
Such activities should promote the free dissemination and mutual exchange of information and knowledge in cultural and scientific fields , assist in educational , social and economic development , particularly in the developing countries , enhance the qualities of life of all peoples and provide recreation with due respect to the political and cultural integrity of States .  
Mr . Kuchel ( United States of America ) : Many difficult compromises were reached in the negotiation of this convention , and we believe the agreement that resulted is a reasonable one accommodating diverse interests , which will prove to be useful addition to the developing body of international law relating to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space .  
In this regard , I am making an earnest appeal to donor States , multilateral institutions and the private sector to support Zambia and other developing States in their efforts to eradicate poverty by direct investment and cancellation of debt , and by ensuring that structural adjustment programmes are humane and responsive to social and environmental concerns .  
I must stress again the need for an increase in international assistance , which we , as a developing country , need if we are to reduce the death rate from the HIV AIDS pandemic , from infectious or parasitic diseases such as tuberculosis , malaria and cholera , and most of all to meet the needs of young men and women for reproductive and sexual health . 
It is for this reason that the Kingdom of Swaziland is in the process of developing a national population policy and a comprehensive reproductive health programme with the participation of representatives of religious leaders , traditional and community leaders , non-governmental organizations , academic institutions , youth and other special groups as well as experts , policy makers and planners .  
In this respect , major challenges face not only developing countries , but also developed ones , and demographic ageing will manifest itself in growth in the cost of old-age pensions , medical care and assistance in daily needs .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
Formulation of policies , strategies and measures to address fisheries needs , including the urgent need to address illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , to ensure essential sources of food supplies for island populations , and economic development ;  
Greater regional coordination in management and monitoring , control and surveillance , including vessel monitoring systems and enforcement , consistent with international agreements of coastal countries and fishing countries in the marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , including the management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks ;  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
Many small island developing States find it increasingly difficult to access concessional development finance due to the application of criteria by some members of the international community , which focus on their relatively higher per capita gross national product levels without taking full account of their actual levels of development , vulnerability or standard of living in real terms .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
Encouragement of strategic alliances between research and development institutions and potential technology users to harness the creative capabilities of the scientific communities in the development of new , proven and innovative adaptation strategies and relevant technologies suitable to the particular circumstances of small island developing States , for example , in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
Yet at the same time we stated candidly that the islands were increasingly vulnerable and that their precarious situation , if left unattended , would soon mirror similar critical circumstances in Africa , the least developed countries and the landlocked developing countries .  
We believe that the Barbados Programme of Action , which calls for actions to be implemented at the national , regional and international levels , provides for an integrated and comprehensive basis for the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
He also described my countrys vision of the future in the light of the architecture of the current international system , and he formulated some concrete proposals to further the search for solutions to the many grave problems facing humanity , now and in the future , particularly the dilemma of the developing countries .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
It is true that the small island developing States will have to make their own efforts for development , but the vigorous support of the international community is indispensable given that economic globalization is creating unprecedented and fierce competition .  
It is widely recognized that the critical environmental problems , especially global warming and sea level rise , affect most dramatically the small island developing States precisely those States which are the least responsible for global climate change .  
The United Nations system itself must continue to play the role of catalyst and stimulant in implementing the Barbados Programme of Action ; it must make more effective use of existing resources and improve the coordinating machinery for focused , agreed implementation activities in priority areas for the achievement of the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
The need for universal commitment to such preventive measures has become more pressing due to the isolation and oceanic location of some small island developing States and their total dependence on a marine and limited terrestrial base , which render them highly vulnerable to contamination from such waste .  
Tunisia welcomes the determination of the small island developing States to meet new and old challenges in order to attain the goals set by the Programme of Action through the elaboration of new national and regional policies that are aimed , in particular , at better integration into the world economy and better coordination of their strategies in the political , social and environmental spheres in order to better address and reduce the problems they face . 
Qatar , which is aware of the international communitys important role in helping small island developing States and other developing countries achieve social development , hopes that the States of the developed world will play their proper role in supporting the economies of developing countries and in reducing the consequences of globalization on our fragile economies .  
Indeed , the issues of climate change , soil erosion , global warming , sea level rise , coastal and marine resources , natural and environmental disasters , biodiversity resources , waste management and freshwater resources are among those that all developing countries face , in particular small island nations , in an increasingly competitive global economy .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
The importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes is reaffirmed .  
Encourage the international community , including bilateral donors and multilateral development organizations , to assist developing countries in ensuring the provision of basic social services , including health-care services for women , in particular during periods of economic difficulty ; socially and gender-sensitive approaches to structural adjustment policies are further encouraged ;  
Urges the Secretary-General , in collaboration with relevant United Nations bodies , to organize , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , regional expert group meetings with a view to developing gender - and age-disaggregated and gender-sensitive psychosocial and mental health situation analyses and indicators as bases for determining progress in womens and girls emotional well-being and mental health ;  
We are confident that the Committee jurisprudence will be open to a developing interpretation of the most controversial points , in the light of the practice of other human rights treaty bodies , and also of the peculiarity of the CEDAW Convention , which provides for a wider scope of social and cultural human rights than other international instruments .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
In this context , the international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect the intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Engage industries and economic sectors , in both public and private sectors , and all other major groups at the national and international levels , as appropriate , in activities relating to sustainable consumption and production with the objective of developing optimal strategies and or programmes , including targets and timetables , at the appropriate levels for more sustainable consumption and production , including cleaner production and affordable eco-efficiency .  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
Governments at all levels , the private sector and other major groups as defined in Agenda 21 are urged to cooperate in developing waste collection systems and disposal facilities , and developing programmes for prevention , minimization and recycling of waste , to safeguard and improve the quality of life in human settlements and coastal regions in all countries , especially in developing countries .  
Many delegations stated that unsustainable consumption and production patterns include both adverse environmental impacts arising from the excess consumption of natural resources , particularly in the developed countries , and unemployment , poverty and underconsumption of basic goods and services , particularly in developing countries .  
Some delegations stated that cleaner production and eco-efficiency , based on improved skills , technologies and efficient use of energy and resources , were essential to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To provide relevant direction on research activities , and collect and disseminate information on best practices and techniques , including an appropriate mix of instruments to minimize negative and to promote positive environmental , social and cultural impacts from tourism in developed and developing countries and in countries with economies in transition ;  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Tourism was recognized as a key rapid growth sector in the world economy with important economic , social , cultural and environmental impacts , particularly in small island developing States and tourist destinations with fragile ecosystems .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
It was recognized that the industrialized countries should take the lead in changing consumption and production patterns , based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , since consumption and production in developing countries were often driven by the patterns in developed countries .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Data based on a number of indicators of the gender gap for different regions show that , for developing countries as a whole , the adult literacy rate is 16 percentage points higher for men than for women ; female school enrolment even at the primary level is 13 per cent lower than the level for males ; and womens share of earned income is a third of the total .  
Developing the capacity to export is particularly crucial in light of the fast expansion of international trade and the limited size of the domestic market of many developing countries .  
The Committee recognized that vulnerability was an important issue for many developing countries , especially the least developed countries ; but to capture all the complex components of vulnerability in just one index posed severe analytical and technical difficulties . 
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial arrangements .  
In industrialized and developing countries , young people are living at a time when profound economic , political , social , cultural and environmental changes are occurring , resulting in both opportunities and constraints .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
In the context of its contribution to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , ILO was currently developing an urban employment programme focused on more and better jobs in the informal sector aimed , among other things , at improving the living and working environment in poor urban neighbourhoods and increasing the capacity of national and municipal governments to create jobs in cities ; it would also promote the adoption of innovative approaches to urban job creation .  
Also reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ;  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA flows , on the other hand , continued to be driven by and large by historical and geographical ties .  
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
The recommendations contained in document E CN . 17-1996-20 Add . 4 continue to be valid and represent minimum conditions that should be fulfilled if small island developing States are to be provided with transport services necessary for balanced structural development as well as improved participation in world trade .  
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
We have established diplomatic relations and are developing beneficial cooperation with all of them , in accordance with the provisions of resolution 50-80 B . In accordance with our foreign policy of open borders and equality and taking advantage of our geostrategic position as a central State in the Balkans we are becoming an important place for the development of international cooperation in all of south-eastern Europe . 
The primary objectives of UNISPACE III are : ( a ) to promote effective means of using space technology to assist in the solution of problems of regional and global significance ; and ( b ) to strengthen the capabilities of Member States , in particular the developing countries , to apply space technology for economic , social and cultural development .  
It was reasonable to expect that , in the foreseeable future , most of the pertinent telecommunication activities and services in developing countries would develop and revolve around those thrust areas , which had been identified as follows : ( a ) distance education ; ( b ) mobile personal communications ; ( c ) direct-to-home television and radio broadcasting ; ( d ) telemedicine ; ( e ) rural telecommunications ; and ( f ) Internet services .  
The farming systems approach to development is considered to be potentially useful in improving planning and analytical capacity in identifying , developing and implementing ways to improve the productivity and therefore welfare of those involved in agriculture in a manner that is equitable and sustainable .  
These companies are developing their offers more and more aggressively , putting forward arguments for legitimacy based on military efficiency , cheaper operations , their personnel ' s proven experience and an alleged comparative advantage that would make it feasible or desirable to hire them for peace _ building or peacekeeping operations such as those conducted by the United Nations or ECOWAS .  
Recalling the widely shared desire expressed during the high-level dialogue of the General Assembly , held on 17 and 18 September 1998 , which constituted a renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , to continue discussions with a view to developing a coherent and effective response to the opportunities and challenges being offered by globalization and interdependence ,  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements , to address issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,  
Also invites the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in close cooperation with the regional economic commissions , within their respective mandates and current resources , as well as with other relevant international organizations , to provide technical assistance and advisory services to the newly independent landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours , taking into account the relevant transit transport agreements ;  
Where backward linkages between tourism and other sectors of the economy are weak or absent , income and employment multipliers from tourism are lower because the potential stimulus to indirect spending is dissipated by increased imports rather than domestic production , as happens with many small island developing States .  
The major challenge facing the international community is to assist Governments , especially those of developing countries , to promote tourism development within the framework of sustainable development in order to maximize the potential economic and social benefits from tourism without damaging the environment or cultural assets .  
Thus , the major challenges facing the international community are to deal with the negative transboundary and global impacts of tourism on the environment and to support the efforts of countries , particularly developing countries , to improve the environmental sustainability of their tourism industries at the national level .  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
In a noteworthy educational project that takes a holistic approach in addressing the needs of the internally displaced and host populations alike , the Norwegian Refugee Council ( NRC ) is developing a nationwide human rights education programme which will provide training and course material on human rights standards to all schools .  
Deeply concerned at the overall declining trend in official development assistance , which is a significant external resource for financing development and an important source of support to the efforts of developing countries , in particular least developed countries , to create an enabling environment for eradicating poverty and tackling basic social needs , especially where private capital flows may either be inadequate or unavailable ,  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Deeply concerned that the international financial crisis has acquired extremely worrying dimensions , posing a threat to world economic development , and that if it were allowed to continue financial turmoil could result in major setbacks to the global economy , in particular to the progress that most developing countries have achieved in the 1990 s ,  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
The CMAs Guiding Principles on Medical Ethics , which were developed in 1993 , are unique in that they represent the only available internationally recognized code of medical ethics to ( a ) deal with conditions of practice in developing countries ; ( b ) set out the ethical obligations of health professionals to vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in the community ; and ( c ) be annotated throughout with references to corresponding internationally recognized human rights instruments .  
The inundation of coastal areas can result in : ( a ) loss of agricultural land , a common concern because agriculture is still the primary source of income in many small island developing States , and most agricultural land lies along the coastline , increasing its vulnerability to sea level rise ; ( b ) loss of exclusive economic zone ( EEZ ) , a common concern because sea level rise will also reduce the exclusive economic zone , thereby reducing the resource base .  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
Pollution of marine and coastal areas from land-based sources of pollution is a major issue for small island developing States ; the pollution is largely from domestic sewage , industrial effluents and agricultural run-off ; in a few larger islands ( for example , Jamaica and some Melanesian countries ) , pollution from mining effluent is also a cause for concern ;  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
Based on the experiences of the past 20 years , it is evident that while the energy strategies of the small island economies will continue to remain primarily focused on improving the management and regulation of petroleum fuels and electric power plants , increasing the role for renewable energy should become an important part of the overall strategy in many small island developing States . 
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
This also would include the development of codes of conduct and frameworks of legislation for the control of invasive and exotic plant and animal species in small island developing States in view of their potential negative impact on indigenous or endemic species .  
Most small island developing States have realized that their inherent , characteristic disadvantages make it all the more necessary for them to develop effective institutions and administrative capacity in order to meet the multitude of challenges arising from the imperatives of resource conservation and environmental protection .  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
The economic , ecological , social and cultural systems of small island developing States are fragile and highly sensitive to external environmental , social and economic change .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
Concluding asset-sharing arrangements as a means of enabling forfeited proceeds of crime to be used to strengthen the capacity of national criminal justice systems and contributing a part of such proceeds to programmes such as those aimed at enhancing national capacities for fighting crime in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , paying due consideration to the rights of bona fide third parties ;  
To continue to provide advisory and technical cooperation services to Member States requesting assistance in drafting and implementing appropriate national legislation and in developing and implementing bilateral , subregional , regional or international treaties on mutual assistance in criminal matters , drawing on the expertise of Member States as appropriate ;  
Continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries ;  
That contracting authorities interested in developing a privately financed infrastructure projects , within their sphere of competence conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility , as well as the environmental impact of the project ;  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
The participation of developing countries - in particular the least developed countries , and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies - and countries with economies in transition , and in particular of their enterprise sectors , in electronic commerce will be an essential ingredient for growth and wealth creation at the global level .  
Research and development networks were a vital way for research institutes and firms in developing countries to leverage their knowledge base with respect to new technologies , including environmentally sound technologies , while partnerships amongst firms in close proximity made possible the creation of the positive externalities such as training programmes and testing laboratories that were needed to meet the new quality standards .  
While highlighting the primary responsibility of national Governments for the development and promotion of SMEs , representatives from developing countries emphasized the critical need for appropriate support and assistance from the international community , particularly through the UNCTAD technical assistance programmes which were relevant to enterprise development .  
Reaffirming the urgent need for further implementation in an effective , equitable and development-oriented way of existing mechanisms for the treatment of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens , and , in this context , stressing the need to agree upon equitable burden-sharing among the international public creditor community ,  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
Notes that further progress , including swift implementation of innovative approaches and concrete measures , is essential for contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , particularly the poorest and heavily indebted countries ;  
In spite of the constraints encountered , many small island developing States have established initiatives to balance tourism activities with broader economic , social and environmental objectives at the regional , national and local levels .  
The fragile ecosystems of small island States and their generally more limited scope for pursuing alternative development strategies make concerns for the environmental impact of tourism very acute , particularly because the sector , which is almost totally dependent on the natural environment , is viewed by many small island developing States as a fast route to social and economic development .  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
The Bank and other agencies that play key roles in developing multilateral PPPs can not get too deeply involved in the internal control and supervision of national basic data collection in participating countries .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
The General Assembly call upon developed countries to commit themselves to the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overall development assistance should be emphasized , as well as the Assembly ' s call upon both developed and developing countries to allocate 20 per cent of their official development assistance and 20 per cent of their national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes .  
While the deliberative process is still ongoing , the greater understanding of the implications of environmental protection for the sustainability of socio-economic development and for the improvement of the quality of life has induced concrete actions in small island developing States to begin the implementation of the Programme of Action .  
The indirect evidence , which is itself sketchy , is that small island developing States , each one at its own pace , are increasingly using a variety of economic instruments and environmental tools such as the environmental impact assessment ( EIA ) and geographic information systems ( GIS ) , strengthening regulations , reforming relevant policies , and implementing priority projects at the sectoral and subsectoral levels to prevent adverse impacts on the environment .  
At the international level , small island developing States have made strenuous efforts to persuade the international community to take earnest and effective measures to arrest global warming and the consequent rise in sea level , and changes in climatic and weather patterns .  
In line with past trends , multilateral disbursements of ODA resources were more evenly distributed among small island developing States ; bilateral ODA , on the other hand , continued by and large to be driven by historical and geographical ties .  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
In recognition of the difficulty of building adequate levels of skills at the national level , small island developing States , particularly in the Pacific and the Caribbean , have established regional institutions by pooling their resources or fashioned new forms of collaboration among existing ones .  
In these and other areas , there is a need for concerted efforts at the international level to provide small island developing States with access to technology on affordable terms , and to assist them in their efforts at establishing regional centres for capacity-building including training in the assessment of technologies as well as their management , technology negotiations and partnerships leading to technology transfer , and adaptation of available technology to local conditions .  
This will require that the Programme of Action be firmly placed on the political agenda at the national , regional and international levels and be fully recognized by Governments and civil society in all small island developing States and the international community as the framework for sustainable development activities in small island developing States .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
The Chinese delegation has always supported such draft resolutions , for the following reasons : first , we support the promotion of international cooperation for the peaceful uses of science and technology so that they can accelerate the economic and social development of countries , particularly the developing countries.Secondly , export control regimes on dual-use goods and technologies should be set up with the universal participation of the international community .  
The subprogramme will give the necessary attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainability , including the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional resources to developing countries , changing production and consumption patterns and mechanisms for technology transfer as mutually agreed to address poverty as an overriding issue .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development _ oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
Similarly , ICLARM , whose operating mission is geared to research and capacity-building in natural resources management , fisheries stock assessment and aquaculture , assisted in a South South training initiative among a number of scientists from the developing world in quantitative genetics and its application to select breeding .  
To help strengthen the capacities of developing countries in sustainable human development through TCDC , the Unit supported a number of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the sharing of experiences in critical areas and strengthening networking among centres of excellence .  
Secondly , as evidenced in the report above , TCDC - both as a modality and as an integral component of contemporary international development cooperation - is increasingly recognized and appreciated by the international community , as offering viable opportunities for improving socio-economic development of developing countries and for enabling their participation and integration in the global economy .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
The key elements of the infrastructure are the databases and developing databases for different purposes and users ( private , public , scientific and government ) is the major task to be accomplished in a systematic development of infrastructure .  
The development of more cost-effective mapping procedures based on satellite data will surely result in increased use of remote sensing data and consequently expand the market for such data , enabling developing countries to collect and update basic information on the topographic and thematic ( natural resource ) cartography of their territories .  
The Cologne initiative should be flexibly interpreted by the international financial institutions to the full benefit of all debtors without discrimination , and appropriate resources should be devoted to reduce considerably the stock of debt and its servicing , while bearing in mind that debt relief measures should safeguard social , economic and political stability in developing countries .  
The concept of special and differential treatment should be reviewed and strengthened to take account of the changing realities of world trade and of globalized production , and must be accompanied by capacity-building , enhanced market access and measures taken by industrialized countries to encourage their enterprises and institutions to transfer technology and know-how and invest in developing countries .  
Recognizing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Emphasizes the urgent need to further develop and use the existing scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters , bearing in mind the particular needs of developing countries , and , in this regard , calls on all countries to strengthen scientific research and training of experts in universities and specialized institutions and to promote the exchange of information ;  
Mr . Talbot ( Guyana ) speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reaffirmed that the fundamental characteristics of operational activities universality , neutrality , multilateralism , non-conditionality and responsiveness to the priorities and needs of developing countries in a flexible manner distinguished the operational activities of the United Nations from those of institutions such as the World Bank and were critical to their future effectiveness and credibility .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) said that the potential development impact of TCDC for developing countries was increasingly being recognized , since South-South cooperation was essential as a means of sharing relevant development experiences , his delegation welcomed the leading role increasingly being taken by developing countries themselves in initiating , organizing and financing TCDC activities , since national ownership and commitment were crucial to the success of South-South cooperation . 
While the active contribution of national authorities and the United Nations system was vital for a successful implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and the New Directions Strategy , the involvement of the private sector and of non-governmental organizations was indispensable in fostering a viable business sector in the developing countries .  
His Government had provided a total of over US $ 2-billion dollars in bilateral and multilateral technical , scientific and economic cooperation to other developing countries and planned to extend its cooperation to include not only Asia and Africa , but also the South Pacific , the Caribbean and Central America and to promote the concept of multiple beneficiaries .  
Bangladesh commended the Secretary-General for highlighting the plight of women in rural areas , women migrant workers and girls affected by traditional and customary practices , and agreed that the effects of globalization and liberalization , along with declining international cooperation , had resulted in the increased marginalization of rural women throughout the developing world .  
In accordance with its original terms of reference , the Committee on Contributions should make concrete recommendations on the methodology for determining the scale of assessments , with a view to making it objective and equitable , and should take into account the problems of developing countries , such as their difficulties in earning foreign exchange and the economic strain of taking in refugees .  
The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .  
In order to ensure that the developing and emerging States derived the maximum economic benefit from the new arrangements , the Commissions legal standards and guidance must take careful note of international financial and capital markets and foster a willingness to modify existing national laws .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Governments should give priority to developing programmes and policies that foster norms and attitudes of zero tolerance for harmful and discriminatory attitudes , including son preference , which can result in harmful and unethical practices such as prenatal sex selection , discrimination and violence against the girl child and all forms of violence against women , including female genital mutilation , rape , incest , trafficking , sexual violence and exploitation . 
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
The Commission also recognized that its discussions and the analysis of the trade issues by the secretariat as well as the technical cooperation activities undertaken had made a positive contribution to the effective integration of developing countries , particularly LDCs and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , as well as the economies in transition , into the international trading system .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area . 
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Reaffirms that , in order to implement the Platform for Action , adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels , as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries , in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries , from all available funding mechanisms , including multilateral , bilateral and private sources , will also be required ;  
Expresses concern that while globalization holds out the promise of prosperity , it brings with it severe challenges for the developing countries , and that the promise of prosperity has not touched the vast majority of the worlds population , especially in the least developed countries , which affects the economic , social and cultural rights of their people ;  
Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , in particular against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations , in particular children , women and the elderly ;  
Reaffirms that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to fulfil their obligations to promote and protect all human rights ;  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
First , countries which possessed space technology tended to monopolize the exploration and use of outer space for their own benefit while developing countries such as his own faced serious constraints which aggravated their poor economic situation and increased their debt .  
International cooperation to that end must be strengthened and the relevant international organizations must take concrete measures , such as technology transfer , financial support and scientific and technical training , in favour of the developing countries .  
The Conference had taken stock of developments in space science and applications , explored new areas of cooperation , considered the changing economic and political environment which offered new opportunities for international cooperation and studied the constraints and issues faced by developing countries in building national capacities to benefit from space technology as well as ways to involve the private sector more closely in the process .  
His delegation looked forward to enhanced regional and international cooperation in space-related activities , as the potential spin-off benefits for the developing countries in such areas as agriculture , industry , medicine and remote sensing were substantial .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Access to the markets of developed countries , the reduction in the external debt of heavily indebted developing countries , together with an increase in ODA , should be the key elements of any credible international policy designed to find a lasting solution to the problem of financing for development .  
He urged the international community to establish a rule-based , equitable and transparent multilateral trading system and said that he hoped that the upcoming round of multilateral trade negotiations would promote development , eliminate trade barriers against developing countries and increase preferential treatment to promote the financing of development through trade .  
The key to fulfilment of those noble objectives and plans of action was financing for development , and it was imperative that a coordinated international effort should be made to address the problems faced by developing countries and to enhance their capacities to play a more active role in the world economy .  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
In its resolution 37-90 of 10 December 1982 , the General Assembly decided that , in accordance with the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , 1 the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be directed towards , among other things , stimulating the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in developing countries .  
Recognizing that while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty by the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with long-term perspectives ,  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financing environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours , at regional , subregional and bilateral levels , inter alia , through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries , and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard ,  
Gravely concerned that the use of unilateral coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries in particular and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open multilateral trading system ,  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the World Trade Organization , to immediately operationalize the special and differential treatment provisions of the multilateral trade agreements so as to enable the developing countries , including the African countries , the least developed countries , small and vulnerable economies and the small island developing States , to derive the potential benefits from trade liberalization in the context of globalization and interdependence ;  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and the continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , inter alia through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
In developing countries , such corruption may undermine economic development through a number of related factors : the misuse or waste of international aid ; unfinished development projects ; discovery and replacement of corrupt politicians , leading to political instability ; and living standards remaining below the countrys potential .  
It must not be forgotten that the European Union already has a single currency , is developing common foreign and defence policies , and even recently appointed a high official to coordinate that undertaking .  
Goals and targets agreed upon by the international community in relation to sustainable development , such as the adoption of national sustainable development strategies and increased support to developing countries , must be implemented in a timely fashion .  
When , after the end of the cold war , the world seemed to be developing towards a promising situation because of the gradual reduction of interState conflicts , the African continent suddenly fell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented violence .  
Unless the developing nations are able to have a fair share in rising levels of global prosperity , the advocacy of democratic values and human and social standards will remain hollow .  
Let us look towards a new vision for a future that will incorporate the weak and strong , the rich and poor and the developed and developing world , so that none will be marginalized .  
The reality shows that the globalization process , based on the international economic relations favourable only for the developed countries , is aggravating poverty in the developing countries and widening disparities between the rich and the poor countries .  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
There exist in the current international political and economic order many unjust and unreasonable factors that are not conducive to the stability and development of the many developing countries .  
For relevant least developed countries in particular , including small island developing States , this may represent a considerable expenditure in the short term , while having a bearing on the future mapping of the natural resources of the continental shelf .  
It should be emphasized that such cooperative activities implemented through effective programmes would contribute significantly to improving the scientific , technological and regulatory capabilities of the developing countries .  
We consider it of prime importance that the renewed Council be a representative and balanced organ through the inclusion of new members , from industrially developed countries and influential developing States alike , pursuing independent foreign policies .  
The draft resolution is entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity .  
The Government of the Slovak Republic has committed itself to developing policies and programmes that will secure and extend the participation of women as equal partners in all areas of political , economic , social and cultural life .  
The group recalled that least developed countries were considered to be lowincome developing countries suffering from a low level of human resource development and economic vulnerability , two structural handicaps to economic growth .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
We are committed to global cooperation to foster international goodwill and understanding and universal friendship and to work in worldwide partnerships developing and promoting a culture of peace .  
The textile and clothing sector , of vital interest to many developing countries , is subject to declining quantitative restrictions until 2005 , with the most meaningful liberalization of existing quotas coming last .  
In retrospect , for some developing countries the period of the 1980s was considered a lost decade because of the heavy burden of debt servicing , falling commodity prices , negative economic growth , unemployment and structural adjustment .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
Although official development finance ( ODF ) has risen from its level in 1996 , that increase of about $ 15-billion has not been sufficient to prevent a sharp drop in the total net resource flow to developing countries in 1998 .  
For many developing countries , in particular countries that are unable to attract sufficient external private capital resources , it is essential that Governments undertake greater efforts to promote the mobilization of domestic sources of capital .  
Many developing countries have also lifted controls on interest rates , reduced governmentdirected credit , developed new instruments for longterm investment financing and built a more effective regulatory and supervisory structure for the financial sector .  
The phenomenal technological advances of the twentieth century had brought about strong industrial growth in the developed world but had left the developing countries far behind .  
It had identified strengthened industrial capacity and clean and sustainable industrial development as the two main priority areas of its technical assistance to the developing countries .  
Its members , who were all highly qualified and experienced in their specializations , understood the concerns of developing countries and appreciated what bilateral and multilateral donors required in project design , preparation and implementation .  
That was especially true in view of the principal objective of the Decade , namely , to reduce the casualties , material damage and social and economic disturbances caused by natural disasters , particularly in developing countries .  
Several comprehensive programmes on sustainable farming systems are being promoted by national authorities in developed and developing countries , by regional and international institutions and NGOs .  
While welcoming the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( A / 54 / 36 ) , she noted that it related to developing countries in particular and focused more on civil and political rights than on economic , social and cultural rights .  
In developing countries with a weak industrial base , a rapid and sustained rise in the levels of income depends on increasing investment , which has a very high import content .  
While UNESCO will be responsible for the conceptual aspects and educational content , ITU , which is developing the standards , will take primary responsibility for the technical implementation and choice of technological solutions .  
There is an ongoing lamentable tendency to downgrade the importance and significance of official development assistance ( ODA ) , which is a vital resource for poorer developing countries with little or no access to international private capital .  
The principles of gradual liberalization in the developing countries , and of differentiated and special treatment of the least developed countries , must be recognized and become an integral element in future trade negotiations .  
Several delegations expressed the view that , for such negotiations to be successful , developed countries must find the political will to overcome narrow domestic interests and deal with the concerns of developing countries in an equitable manner .  
A third part is the increasingly large and unpredictable private capital flows across national boundaries that have substantially reduced the leverage of Governments , particularly of developing countries , in controlling their economic fate .  
The problem of external debt posed a major financial and fiscal challenge for most developing countries which impacted negatively on their capacity to pay , particularly when foreign exchange was involved .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Many Governments stressed that developing countries would need technical and financial assistance from the international community to prepare effectively for and participate in the national and regional preparatory processes .  
In close coordination with local and national authorities , steps to promote social and institutional advances can help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
She also raised the legal , economic , social , human and environmental problems caused by the export of contaminated ships destined for scrap in developing countries .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Demands of labour mobility accompanying the growth of the market economy in some developing countries have created a transient internal population , with low and insecure wages and poor access to housing , medical care and schooling for their children .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
Electricity is increasingly assuming greater importance in the total energy mix , particularly in developing countries , with increasing recognition of adequate and reliable electric power as important to economic and social development .  
In the light of the changing nature of security problems , with more intrastate as opposed to interState conflicts , special attention will have to be placed on developing coherent , comprehensive approaches to crises .  
There is however no easy fix for the institutional impediments in many developing countries , above all unsupportive regulatory environments and exorbitant charges imposed by national authorities .  
By the same token , the rest of the world can not ignore the unique contribution of small island developing States to global sustainability , through their rich biodiversity , their vast areas of marine resources and their coral reef systems .  
Small island developing States on their own are simply unable to shoulder the vast responsibility that falls upon them the guardianship of the essential global public goods , without increased support from the international community .  
UNDP will work in close coordination with local and national authorities to take steps to promote social and institutional advances to help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
The Conference underlines the role of IAEA in assisting developing countries in the peaceful use of nuclear energy through the development of effective programmes aimed at improving their scientific , technological , and regulatory capabilities .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
The resources devoted to huge arsenals nuclear and conventional take up the funds that could be devoted to economic development and social progress , which is of great importance to the people of developed and developing countries alike .  
Investment in education , including basic and digital literacy , remains the fundamental way of developing human capacity and should be at the heart of any national , regional and international information technology strategy .  
To further foster the exchange of national and regional experiences in the functional commissions , donors are encouraged to provide financial resources to support participation of additional experts from developing countries .  
With regard to public and private resources , we are currently developing a mixed welfareState model that gives public support in the form of financial relief and special subsidies and the like to private institutions providing social services .  
They also result in inequities in international economic relations and in a widening gap between the rich developed countries of the north and the poor developing countries of the south , where 80 per cent of the worlds poorest live .  
It was considered that the narrative should have included references to the effects of endemic structural adjustments and to the negative impact of the economic crisis at the international level which affected developing countries .  
The following issues are raised to solicit responses from States on the diverse effects of globalization at the national , regional and international levels , as a means of developing understanding for a constructive exchange of views on globalization .  
APFIC reported that the issues concerning illegal , unregulated and unreported ( IUU ) fishing were widely recognized and were ongoing in the APFIC area , by both developed and developing fishing nations .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
Residual effects of regional conflicts and of the tension that marked the cold war have led to an unprecedented increase in the illicit traffic in small arms and light weapons , whose intended recipients are mainly developing countries .  
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
The United States representative noted that rapid growth in international private investment , lending and trade meant that private capital flows now exceeded ODA as the foremost source of external capital available to developing countries generally . 
It is imperative that even as we work towards developing the requisite political will , in the interim the international community accepts the need for urgent practical steps that will diminish nuclear dangers .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
At both local and international levels , Egypt had taken earnest steps to prevent crime and establish social justice through its legislative , executive and judicial authorities by developing and updating its laws and devising appropriate punishment regimes .  
But it was not just a question of free trade ; many developing countries were desperately in need of basic physical , educational , legal and even political infrastructure in order to participate in the global economy .  
In keeping with the concept of shared responsibility in promoting economic and social development , it was understood that the scarce resources of the developing countries should be supplemented by the huge resources at the disposal of the developed nations .  
What has been missing is the supportive external economic environment that has been considered critical to ensure accelerated development in developing countries .  
The majority of developing countries were unable to attract external private capital ; their share in world trade had continued to decline , contributing to low levels of development and inadequate infrastructure .  
The negative effects resulted mainly from the increased dominant or monopoly power of the merged firm , and this made competition between large multinational corporations and companies of developing countries ever more difficult .  
Lastly , he stressed the importance of moving beyond the NorthSouth divide and developing partnerships with key nongovernmental actors in globalization , including international economic institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
In the interests of preserving cultural diversity , the European Union also considered it essential that the local content of the Internet in the developing countries , and particularly in the least developed countries , should be enhanced and developed .  
It had pointed to empirical evidence showing that the gap was growing between the developed and developing countries in the wake of globalization , and concluded that the prime objective should be to make globalization beneficial for all countries and peoples .  
For some , the international level was most important : inadequate regulation allowed speculative capital to cascade in and out of fragile markets in the developing world .  
Clearly , the active and growing participation of the developing countries in trade flows required a competitive economy at the national level , but also a favourable international environment .  
The Minister defined the key objective of the Government as fighting poverty and improving the living conditions of the population by developing strong partnerships with the private sector , civil society and the donor community .  
He said that landlocked developing countries left on their own would not be able to cope with the formidable challenges posed by the acute problems facing them and that this fact was clearly recognized by the international community .  
The textile and clothing sector , of vital interest to many developing countries , is subject to declining quantitative restrictions until 2005 , with the most meaningful liberalization of existing quotas coming last , and tariffs in the sector will remain high .  
This , as noted above , requires in turn an enabling international environment , including dynamic trade opportunities and a substantial , stable and sustained net transfer of resources to developing countries and lowerincome transition economy countries .  
The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
Although global ODA flows have been declining and they have become small relative to private flows of capital , it was reported that aid to the Pacific island developing countries has been maintained and will be required for some decades to come . 
Even for the larger developing countries , ODA continues to have major qualitative significance ; due to their low economic development and limited domestic resources , ODA is still irreplaceable for them .  
Of critical importance is a fair , equitable and rulesbased multilateral trading system , operating in a nondiscriminatory , inclusive and transparent manner that provides benefits for all countries , especially developing countries .  
Enabling domestic environments : governance issues ; sound macroeconomic policies , including fiscal and private savings policies ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
Enhancing trade for financing development : ensuring market access for products of export interest to developing countries ; addressing issues related to the decline of public revenues from trade liberalization ; strengthening regional cooperation / integration for expansion of global trade ; capacity-building and technical assistance , including assistance for trade negotiations and dispute settlement ; special needs of Africa , the least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked and transit developing countries and other developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition with special difficulties in attracting financing for development .  
The discussion revolved around providing specific time frames towards meeting the internationally agreed ODA target of 0.7 per cent of GNP to counter the declines in past years ; developing each countrys own comprehensive strategy , including the establishment of sound macroeconomic policies and national partnerships in an effort to use ODA most effectively ; and the growing concerns regarding global public goods .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
Invites the Bureau of the preparatory committee to play an active and important role in the intergovernmental preparations for the World Summit and to mobilize political support at the highest possible level in both developed and developing countries while pursuing the support of all heads of international organizations within the United Nations system and of international financial institutions and the Global Environment Facility and to actively support the role of the Committee in monitoring with a view to considering the reports of all relevant intergovernmental processes .  
The Committee agreed that beneficial uses of space such as strengthening communications infrastructure , disaster management , education , agriculture , environmental protection and natural resource management had enormous relevance for human development , in particular in developing countries , and that the wider adoption of such beneficial applications would strengthen the goal of maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes .  
The Committee noted with appreciation the continuing efforts undertaken through the United Nations Programme on Space Applications , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , in leading an international effort to establish and operate regional centres for space science and technology education in existing national or regional educational institutions in developing countries .  
Some delegations reiterated the view that the geostationary orbit was a limited natural resource with sui generis characteristics that risked saturation , and that its utilization should be based on the principle of rational and equitable access for all countries , taking into account the special needs of developing countries and the geographical situation of particular countries .  
Also calls upon States and regional economic integration organizations to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund established by the United Nations Environment Programme in order to support the interim arrangements and the operation of the Conference of the Parties until the end of the fiscal year in which the first meeting of the Conference of Parties takes place , and to ensure the full and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the further work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee ;  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
As to his own preventive role , the Secretary-General thinks that it could be enhanced by increasing the use of interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile areas ; by developing regional prevention strategies with regional partners and the relevant United Nations organs and agencies ; by establishing an informal network of eminent persons ; and by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
We , therefore , support the ideas contained in the report for strengthening the Secretary-Generals traditional roles in this area by , for example , increasing the use of interdisciplinary United Nations fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , developing regional preventive strategies with relevant regional organizations and establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
Mr . Kolby ( Norway ) : Many of todays wars are internal , protracted , fought in developing countries along ethnic , linguistic or religious divides , fuelled by illicit economic activity and fought with small arms and light weapons , and they involve a high proportion of non-State actors . 
In this context , we see the reported achievements especially as establishing conditions on the ground allowing the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to be free to decide to return to their pre-war homes or to choose to live elsewhere , and as developing a modern , independent and effective judiciary system as well as responsible and non-political police structures .  
Preliminary discussions with UNCHS identified the following areas of possible cooperation for further consideration : ( a ) substantive support to the Special Rapporteur in carrying out his mandate ; ( b ) developing a joint United Nations housing rights programme and , in this context , supporting the UNCHS Global Campaign on Secure Tenure as a component of housing rights ; ( c ) promoting integration of a housing rights component in field operations , advisory services and technical cooperation activities ; and ( d ) contributing to the Istanbul + 5 process .  
The independent expert has drawn attention to the following multilateral facilities dealing with the debt problems of developing countries : structural adjustment and concessional financing facilities of international financial institutions , world trade organizations and developed industrial countries programmes of providing market access , restructuring of the international financial system to solve the many problems of inadequacy and instability of financial flows of developing countries .  
The international community should therefore renew its support for the Office by at least maintaining the level of its contributions thereby enabling it , until such time as definitive solutions were found , to relieve human suffering , particularly in the developing countries , which received the largest number of refugees .  
The worldwide network of institutions collaborating through the workshops in the past decade has been supporting : ( a ) ground-based networks of small optical and radio telescopes and associated research and education programmes ; and ( b ) a new concept for a multinational space-based astronomical satellite mission ( World Space Observatory ) , particularly for the benefit of developing countries .  
Large-scale interregional projects are currently being implemented on the initiative of and with direct participation by Turkmenistan in the energy , transport and communication sectors with a view to giving impetus to the accelerated economic development of the countries of the region and narrowing the technology gap between developed and developing and industrial and agrarian States .  
Given the global character that the problem of securing and distributing energy resources is assuming in the twenty-first century , as well as its own huge fuel potential , Turkmenistan has set about developing and implementing large-scale projects involving the laying of pipelines westward , southward and eastward .  
The modern world was characterized by the increasing interdependence of countries and economies , but neo-liberal globalization , far from facilitating the technological advance of all nations , exacerbated the inequities and disparities between industrialized and developing countries and between rich and poor .  
Enhance the capacity of developing countries , particularly least developed countries ( LDCs ) , and countries with economies in transition , to analyse the challenges posed by the ongoing processes of liberalization and globalization and the increasing integration of those countries into the global economic system and to formulate appropriate national policies accordingly ;  
Content : Structural features and trade flows , regional and international trade ; the changing role of commodities and services ; trade facilitation , information technology and transport and logistics ; e-commerce ; trade and environment policies , trade and environment in the World Trade Organization ( selected WTO agreements , dispute settlement , built-in agenda ) ; market access ; TRIPS ; traditional knowledge ; as well as the positive agenda and basic elements for the formulation of a developing country trade policy .  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
It was held pursuant to paragraph 134 of the Bangkok Plan of Action , adopted by UNCTAD X , and its major objective was to identify , on a country-specific basis , challenges and concerns confronting least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) in the face of the reform process in agriculture and to contribute to the formulation of negotiating proposals by LDCs and NFIDCs in the ongoing World Trade Organization ( WTO ) negotiations on agriculture , so as to ensure that those negotiations would effectively address their concerns .  
Experts indicated that margin of preference in international tendering allocated to local firms should be sufficient to allow their effective participation , and that criteria established for participation in multilaterally financed projects should not be so stringent as to exclude domestic construction firms in developing countries .  
It justly identified deepening poverty and inequality , proliferating conflict , the deadly spread of the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) and continuing discrimination , particularly against women and girls , as formidable challenges in developing future actions for children .  
Until recently , the right to development had not received the recognition it deserved , and yet several developing countries had been chastised for alleged human rights violations , and their failures had been magnified disproportionately , while they were doing their utmost to satisfy the basic necessities of their rapidly growing populations .  
However , given the deep concern of the developing countries with regard to their limited capacity to participate in the global economy and consequent marginalization , one of the major challenges in the coming years would be how to ensure that the benefits of the global economy were shared by all .  
United Nations peacekeeping is an international responsibility to be shared by all States Members of the Organization in all its aspects , but a case can , and has in fact been made , for logistical , training and other technical support from the developed countries for potential troop contributors from the developing countries , even as the former participate actively themselves in peacekeeping operations .  
Japan fully supported the language in the draft resolution taken from the Millennium Declaration ( A / RES / 55 / 2 ) and the outcome document adopted at the end of the World Summit for Social Development and Beyond : Achieving Social Development for All in a Globalizing World , entitled Further initiatives for social development , but was particularly concerned that the eleventh preambular paragraph of the draft resolution stated that the widening gap between the developed and the developing countries had contributed , inter alia , to deepening poverty .  
Underlying the immediate concern over oil prices were the global macroeconomic imbalances and systemic weaknesses exposed by the Asian crisis , and failure to resolve economic imbalances in an orderly manner would be most damaging to growth in developing countries .  
The recent call by industrial countries for coordinated international policy action in the face of rising oil prices was to be welcomed , but it contrasted sharply with the indifference to similar calls from the developing world when faced with the devastating consequences of falling commodity prices .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the least developed countries , said that economic interdependence was a matter of utmost importance for the developing countries , and their interests had to be recognized and reflected in the reform of the international financial system . 
The representative of Norway said that developing countries , which were already suffering from falling commodity prices , debt problems and insufficient ODA flows , were particularly vulnerable to a slowdown in economic growth in the developed countries .  
Past experience had shown that developing countries which pursued policies encouraging private investment , trade , and entrepreneurship , along with appropriate social investment , had achieved remarkable economic growth in a short span of time .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran , speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and China , reiterated the importance attached by his Group to the question of the financing of experts in UNCTAD expert meetings and the need for funding in that respect .  The participation of experts from developing countries enhanced the complementarity between technical cooperation and analytical and deliberative work and helped in integrating these activities , as called for by UNCTAD X .  
Despite the remarkable progress achieved in the 1990s ( in which 80 per cent of young children in developing countries had been immunized ; polio was on the verge of eradication ; more children than ever before were enrolled in schools ; and iodized salt was now being used on a wide scale ) , too many children were still dying from treatable diseases brought about by various causes linked to poverty and violence and by the AIDS pandemic .  
The UNDG has set up a working group , chaired by UNFPA , with the objective of developing a common process for programme approval , taking into consideration the need for further harmonization and simplification of programmes and programming procedures for all United Nations organizations in the UNDG in order to provide the basis for a substantive , timely and joint oversight function of the respective Executive Boards .  
The main challenge lies both for developed and developing countries in the development , utilization and dissemination of renewable energy technologies , such as solar , wind , ocean , wave , geothermal , biomass and hydro power , on a scale wide enough to significantly contribute to energy for sustainable development .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
[ The [ expansion ( Norway replace with ) enhanced use ] of existing ( Canada replace with ) Use of ] international mechanisms [ ( Canada / Norway delete ) or development of new mechanisms ] to identify risks and ensure they are managed on a transparent basis [ ( Canada delete ) and with an effective and equitable partnership between investors and host countries , for those developing countries that do not have institutional structures that are adequately prepared to deal with the scale of risk associated with major energy investments ] .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
Within this context , and also in light of growing interdependence in an era of globalization , some delegations emphasized that developing and developed countries shared responsibilities in realizing rights and should fulfil their duties in a manner that promoted equitable development based on sovereign equality , mutual interest and cooperation .  
In particular , he referred to three areas addressed at the first session of the Working Group which called for international action and solidarity : ( a ) how to ensure that developing countries benefited from global trade and that their benefits therefrom would be distributed equitably and with benefit to the poor ; ( b ) how innovation and technological progress could be made accessible to everyone ; and ( c ) how to ensure that developing countries would have access to necessary medicines , particularly in their fight against HIV / AIDS and other pandemic diseases .  
The European Union held the view that space activities must be carried out in line with two fundamental principles , namely that space technology must promote social , economic and cultural development as well as the protection of the terrestrial and spatial environment and that access to outer space must be regulated on an equitable basis in the light of the real needs of the developing countries .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
The recognition of special and differential treatments in favour of developing countries and an open , rule-based , transparent , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system are essential factors for a healthy global economic system .  
We emphasize the importance of more stable and predictable financing for social and economic development and stress the important role that official development assistance can still play , in this respect , for the majority of developing countries , particularly least developed countries and other countries with limited potential for domestic savings or export earnings .  
We stress that the major creditor countries should loosen their grip on the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture ; they should accept that representation in existing multilateral financial institutions should become broader and more balanced and that meaningful participation by developing countries in the decision-making processes , as well as greater transparency in such processes , should be ensured .  
Reaffirm that international cooperation is a necessity deriving from the recognized mutual interest of all countries and , therefore , that such cooperation should be strengthened in order to , inter alia , financially and technologically support the efforts of developing countries to solve their social and economic problems and to assist them , wherever possible , in the fulfilment of their obligations with regard to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ;  
In the light of the developing situation on the ground and particularly the resumption of hostilities in May 2000 , which necessitated the rapid reinforcement of the military component of the Mission and consequently the rapid transportation of contingent-owned equipment to the mission area , 10,635 and 2,057 metric tons of contingent-owned equipment were transported by air and surface , respectively , resulting in the unforeseen additional requirements totalling $ 22,023,000 .  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , the focus will be , inter alia , on improving administrative response capacity in emergency situations through the implementation of streamlined administrative procedures ; ensuring effective and timely support in the field ; developing simplified working arrangements with United Nations central services and other service providers ; finalizing a roster of emergency personnel for rapid deployment ; and developing field administrative manuals and guidelines .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The Commission could note that there is a strong need for adequate and efficient , economically viable , socially acceptable and environmentally sound transport systems , especially in developing countries where accessibility and affordability are important for the eradication of poverty , improving access to social services and access to employment opportunities . 
Efforts to establish an international enabling environment should be conducted in a spirit of partnership between developed and developing countries based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and taking into account the specific conditions of individual countries , in accordance with the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 .  
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
Ms . Schpp-Schilling acknowledged that sexual stereotyping existed in both developed and developing countries , but it was particularly difficult to end the practice when it was deeply rooted in cultural and customary traditions .  
To develop and disseminate policy , legal , technical and other expertise and information that will assist countries at all stages of legal , social and economic development in controlling computer-related crime in order to ensure that security concerns do not become an obstacle to bridging the digital divide between developed and developing countries .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
Under article 272 , there is a particular duty to coordinate activities of international programmes : States are to endeavour to ensure that international organizations competent in the field of transfer of marine technology coordinate their activities , including any regional or global programmes , taking into account the interests and needs of developing States , particularly landlocked and geographically disadvantaged States .  
In view of the increasing functions assigned to the technical body in the General Secretariat , they entrust the Secretary-General , together with the Economic and Social Council , with the task of supporting and developing that body with a view to triggering the Arab mechanisms and institutions responsible for following up joint Arab economic action .  
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
In addition , the attention of the Committee is drawn to General Assembly resolution 55 / 186 of , entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity , in paragraph 25 of which the Assembly requested that the resolution be made available to the Committee as an input to its work on the systemic issues contained in its preliminary substantive agenda . 
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
The Office of the Procurator for the Protection of Human Rights was also implementing , with support from UNICEF and from Save the Children , a prevention project entitled Protection of the basic rights of children and young people , designed to involve children and young people in collective activities at the local and national level by developing their capacities and skills as leaders and organizers .  
In paragraph 2 of its resolution 1566 ( L ) , the Council considered that the ultimate goal of the work of the Commission should be the achievement of an integrated system in the collection , data processing and dissemination of international statistics by the organs and agencies of the United Nations system with special regard to the requirements of reviewing and appraising economic and social progress , taking into account the needs of the developing countries . 
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
The role of developing countries in establishing or enhancing favourable conditions for a sustainable enabling environment for both domestic and international investments , including improving the legal , economic and social environment for investment .  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
Trade is the most important mechanism for most if not all small island developing States to expand domestic savings and finance their various development processes especially because they seriously lack comparative advantages and economies of scale , being vulnerable and dependent on a small number of export commodities , predominantly agriculture , light manufacturing and underdeveloped service-based sectors , to drive much-needed foreign exchange earnings , employment and development . 
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Nevertheless , although the individual countries must mobilize the domestic resources that they need for their development , the high-level international event should acknowledge that some developing countries do not have a sound enough economic base to ensure that they will have the necessary production , saving and management capacity to undertake , on their own , the effort of financing poverty-reduction programmes and ensuring growth .  
In that context , the member States of WTO should not have recourse to restrictive measures and rules and should ensure that standards , technical specifications and sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used to obstruct trade , that they can be complied with by developing countries and that the latter receive sufficient assistance to that end .  5.5 The developed countries and the international organizations concerned should urgently institute measures to help the developing countries to cope with fluctuations in basic prices .  
Supporting the efforts of developing countries to create open economies , with adequately supervised and well regulated financial markets , strong economic institutions , and credible and transparent economic policy frameworks .  
Recognition of the particular problems faced by small island developing States relating to their remoteness from major markets , modest natural resource and export bases , narrow skills bases , heavy reliance on costly imports , limited access to private capital , and vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental degradation .  
Under the direct supervision of the Senior Adviser to the Executive Director , the incumbent collects and analyses data pertinent to the management of the organization ; organizes and summarizes background information and prepares summary reports on specific issues analysed , and develops draft recommendations thereon ; holds consultative meetings with senior staff in UNEP and the United Nations Office at Nairobi to seek information required and to discuss work practices ; and contributes to developing and strategizing the presentation of management data ;  
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
The General Assembly recommended that , at their high-level meeting , the Economic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions consider the modalities needed to consolidate further a broader global agenda for a strengthened and stable international financial system that was responsive to the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity in the global economy ( Assembly resolution 55 / 186 , para .  24 ) .  
For lower-income developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , official development assistance ( ODA ) is the major source of external funding , notably for basic education and health expenditures , financing of a social safety net and infrastructure investment .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
Considers it intolerable that 826-million people , most of them women and children , throughout the world and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically fragile areas ;  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
Rejects the application of such measures as tools for political or economic pressure against any country , particularly against developing countries , because of their negative effects on the realization of all human rights of vast sectors of their populations , inter alia , children , women , the elderly , disabled and ill people ;  
Underlines that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and , in this regard , calls upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the development of developing countries , as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Right to Development in its report ( E / CN . 4 / 1998 / 29 ) ;  
Deeply convinced of the need to create a new spirit of international cooperation based on the principle of achieving shared benefits , but also based on common but differentiated responsibilities , between the developing and industrialized countries ,  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Aware that the serious problem of the foreign debt burden remains one of the most critical factors adversely affecting economic , social , scientific and technical development and living standards in many developing countries , with serious effects of a social nature ,  
Considering that the measures for alleviating the debt problem , of both official and private origin , have not achieved an effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solution to the outstanding debt and debt service of a large number of developing countries , especially the poorest and heavily indebted countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Deeply concerned that , 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continues to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness are particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
Reaffirms that efforts to make globalization fully inclusive and equitable must include policies and measures at the global level which correspond to the needs of the developing countries , formulated and implemented with their effective participation , and in this regard requests the international economic governance institutions to promote broad-based decision-making ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Urges all Governments to take appropriate legislative and other measures , in line with their international obligations , to prevent the illegal international trafficking in toxic and hazardous products and wastes , the transfer of toxic and hazardous products and wastes through fraudulent waste-recycling programmes , and the transfer of polluting industries , industrial activities and technologies which generate hazardous wastes from developed to developing countries ;  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace , as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion ,  
In pursuit of the objectives , the major themes and the focus areas identified in the medium-term plan for the period 2002-2005 , the programme for the biennium 2002-2003 embodies the ESCAP vision towards 2005 in seven interdependent and complementary subprogrammes , gearing its activities towards the alleviation of poverty ; the reinforcement of the weakening positions of developing countries arising from the process of globalization ; and detection and addressing of emerging economic and social problems and issues in the region .  
Objective : To support economic cooperation , which has a vital role to play in reducing economic asymmetries and in assisting developing countries , especially the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries and the countries with economies in transition , in their efforts to become effectively integrated into the regional and global economies .  
How to strengthen public-private partnerships , including through ODA leverage and the support of the international and regional financial institutions , to finance critical infrastructure projects and other priority development areas for developing countries and countries with economies in transition , not only by sharing risk with the private sector but also by improving awareness of business opportunities in these countries ?  
A central challenge is to ensure a stable , predictable , non-discriminatory , transparent , fair and equitable multilateral trading system in support of development , which contributes in a coherent manner to spread the benefits of trade to all developing countries , ensuring rapid and sustained growth of incomes and exports to finance their development goals .  
How best to enhance cooperation between donors and recipient countries so that resources are available on a timely basis to respond to improvements in domestic policies and the ensuing opportunities for investments in areas key to the achievement of Millennium Summit goals and other internationally agreed targets , through the development of comprehensive poverty reduction strategies by developing countries and matching commitments from donors for coordinated and harmonized support ?  
How to encourage all relevant national , regional and international policy-making forums to further pursue efforts to become more accountable , responsive and transparent to public concerns , as well as to review their composition and consultation mechanisms so as to ensure fuller and deeper participation of developing countries and adequate consultation with all concerned actor and stakeholder groups ?  
Recognize the necessity of increasing appropriate preventive measures in order to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination , and the important role that international organizations , Governments , local authorities , the media , non-governmental organizations and civil society can play in developing such measures and building confidence between different racial and ethnic groups ;  
Request the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to take initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation among States , and between them and international organizations for the purpose of concluding agreements , coordinating activities and developing programmes in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination ;  
Urge the United Nations , other appropriate international and regional organizations and States to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to widely disseminate the truth about Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity ;  
Also urge them to recognize that the art and technology of developing multiracial and multicultural societies and the positive example of successful multiracial societies such as some of those in the Caribbean need to be systematically studied , and therefore request the United Nations to consider establishing an international centre for multiracial studies and policy development to undertake this critical work ;  
At that time , the General Assembly confirmed the principle of adequate representation of the various legal and economic systems and of the developing and the developed world , as well as the principle of equitable geographical distribution of seats .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in preparing his analytical report on the progress made in the implementation of General Assembly resolution 55 / 188 of 20 December 2000 , to devote a separate section of the report to a global study on the illegal transfer of funds , especially funds derived from acts of corruption , and the impact of the illegal transfer of funds on economic , social and political progress , in particular in developing countries ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
[ 31 ] Experience shows that farmers both in developed and developing countries are aware of the environmental , occupational and health improvements that organic production can generate [ 32 ] , but their main motivation is still improved income in the short-term , [ 33 ] rather than concern about the environment in the longer term . 
There are several short - and medium-term measures developing countries should consider for profiting from enhanced production and export opportunities : ( i ) awareness-raising ; ( ii ) research and market studies ; ( iii ) facilitating certification and reducing its costs ; ( iv ) developing national standards ; ( v ) developing local markets ; and ( vi ) providing appropriate governmental and technical support .  
ACCs deliberations on information and communication technologies ( ICT ) focused more broadly on the contribution ICT could make in advancing some of the basic objectives that the system was endeavouring to support and advance : the integration of developing countries in the global knowledge society , and the pursuit of growth and efficiency in key sectors of the economy , in ways that serve to further the social and cultural goals of societies . 
They considered that the closest inter-agency collaboration in integrating ICT into the United Nations systems operations and in helping developing countries bridge the digital divide was essential for the system to remain effective and relevant in a rapidly changing global environment .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Notes further with satisfaction the increase in developed countries support to technical and economic cooperation among developing countries including through triangular arrangements and , in this context , encourages developing countries , regional and subregional institutions and centres of excellence , in collaboration with the Special Unit , to draw lessons from past experiences in triangular cooperation and design innovative South-South cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling greater participation by donor countries in such programmes ;  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
Encourages the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions , to document and disseminate innovative and successful practices of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , including triangular cooperation arrangements and those supported by the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system ;  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
The report notes significant progress in implementing the new directions strategy , especially in areas such as the strategic orientation of TCDC activities , advancing TCDC through pivotal countries , new developments in triangular cooperation , sharing knowledge and experiences and the integration of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries .  
He acknowledged that the increasing sophistication and complexity of TCDC activities , greater regional and inter-country cooperation among developing countries , increased resource allocations for TCDC by developing countries , greater emphasis on long-term cooperation and enhanced modalities of triangular cooperation marked the maturity of the emerging trends in the area of TCDC observed in the previous biennium .  
Taking into account that the Special Unit for TCDC is understaffed and underfunded , it must be selective in its activities , which should include : improving knowledge of all TCDC programmes worldwide ; highlighting and exchanging successful and unsuccessful development experiments ; increasing research cooperation ; developing knowledge platforms in priority areas , including increasing the usefulness of WIDE ; developing new criteria for the selection of initiatives to be supported ; and increasing the participation of new actors , e.g . , the private sector , social sector , and foundations .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
The objectives of third-country training , which takes place in a particular region where developing countries have a common base in terms of natural , social and cultural factors , are to transfer the technology and know-how of Japan in a form that is compatible with local conditions , and to promote TCDC .  
With the support of Member States , I intend to enhance the traditional preventive role of the Secretary-General in four ways : first , by increasing the use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile regions ; second , by developing regional prevention strategies with our regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies ; third , by establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention ; and fourth , by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
The Meeting adopted a document entitled Framework for cooperation in peace-building ( S / 2001 / 138 , annex I ) , in which the United Nations and regional organizations agreed on guiding principles for cooperation in this field as well as on possible cooperative activities , such as establishing peace-building units , sending joint assessment missions to the field , developing repertories of best practices and lessons learned and the joint holding of pledging conferences .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
We request the international community to strongly support poverty eradication , and welcome the ongoing consultations by the Secretary-General on the establishment of a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication to finance and realize , inter alia , the social policies and programmes of the Habitat Agenda to address challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries , especially the least developed countries , bearing in mind the voluntary nature of the contributions .  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
Support and encourage the development of national and international research infrastructure , laboratory capacity , improved surveillance systems , data collection , processing and dissemination , and training of basic and clinical researchers , social scientists , health-care providers and technicians , with a focus on the countries most affected by HIV / AIDS , particularly developing countries and those countries experiencing or at risk of rapid expansion of the epidemic ;  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
In view of declining levels of official development assistance , he observed that developing countries would have to depend more on mobilizing their own resources for development and , to that end , they must examine the percentages of their gross national product and central government budgets that are devoted to military expenditures .  
It encourages [ political parties to take concrete steps to promote solidarity , tolerance and respect , inter alia by developing [ model ] voluntary code [ s ] of conduct as well as penal measures for members of such parties that engage in statements and actions that could encourage or incite racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance and racist sentiment among the public ] ;  
It also urges them to recognize that the art and technology of developing multiracial and multicultural societies and the positive example of successful multiracial societies such as some of those in the Caribbean region need to be systematically studied , and therefore requests the United Nations to consider establishing an international centre for multiracial and multicultural studies and policy development to undertake this critical work ;  
Urges States and financial and development institutions to mitigate the negative effects of globalization by examining how their policies and practices affect indigenous peoples ; by ensuring that their policies and practices contribute to the eradication of racism through the participation of indigenous peoples in development projects in accordance with the principle of informed consent ; by democratizing international financial institutions ; by developing enforceable codes of conduct for transnational corporations ; and by consulting with indigenous peoples in any matter that may affect their physical , spiritual or cultural integrity ;  
The Group was convinced that the industrialization strategy developed through the integrated programmes constituted one of the best means of ensuring the sustainable industrial development of developing countries and of alleviating poverty and ensuring productive employment .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
Accessibility to reliable and affordable energy was very unevenly distributed , both between countries and within countries , and many developing countries faced an urgent need to provide adequate , reliable and affordable energy services to millions of people in rural areas .  
Attention should also be paid to the joint implementation of projects ; such an approach was not only useful from the environmental standpoint but would also foster cooperation between the industrialized and developing countries , and between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , which was important for the transfer of technology and acceptance of international standards on management and production quality .  
His countrys abiding desire was to promote friendship and solidarity with the peoples of Africa and to see UNIDO fully assume its vital role in enabling a vast proportion of the worlds population , those in developing countries and countries with emerging economies , to enjoy the quality of life to which they were entitled .  
Following the decision by the General Assembly to re-establish the Unit for Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States , the activities of the Office of the Special Coordinator related to the particular needs and problems of 30 landlocked developing countries and 44 small island developing States have expanded and intensified with a view to improving the participation and accelerated integration of the two groups of countries into the global economy through internationally agreed support measures and special recognition on grounds of vulnerability .  
It has also commissioned four case studies on recent developments of transit transport systems in South-East Asia , South Asia , Latin America and southern and eastern Africa , as well as a study entitled Infrastructure development in landlocked and transit developing countries : foreign aid , private investment and the transport cost burden on landlocked developing countries .  
During the current biennium , the Office of the Special Coordinator has also intensified its support to the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 of the Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , with a view to increasing the chances of small island developing States to find new economic opportunities in the global economy and avoid their further marginalization .  18 .  The Office of the Special Coordinator continued to provide analytical work on the economic vulnerability of small island developing States .  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
Each regional commission is expected to select five eminent persons from its region from a cross-section of stakeholders , including experts from Governments , research institutions and the private sector , in their personal capacities , with a view to developing ideas for concrete initiatives from regional and subregional perspectives within the framework and in support of the substantive agenda of the Conference .  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food . 
Below 500-m3 , the situation becomes critical and between 100 and 200-m3 , the situation is considered a severe water shortage . 38 There is also a considerable inequality in consumption of water between developed and developing countries and over-consumption by the wealthy mirrors the under-consumption of the poor . 
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening an international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction and within its framework of action ;  
Recognizing the important dimension and role of tourism as a positive instrument towards the alleviation of poverty and the improvement of the quality of life for all people , its potential to make a contribution to economic and social development , especially of the developing countries , and its emergence as a vital force for the promotion of international understanding , peace and prosperity ,  
That the Parties included in Annex I shall implement domestic action in accordance with national circumstances and with a view to reducing emissions in a manner conducive to narrowing per capita differences between developed and developing country Parties while working towards achievement of the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
The Unit otherwise supports the work of NGOs by disseminating international human rights promotional and training material and developing a mechanism through which information collated and analysed by the Unit and East Timorese NGOs will be preserved and accessible for future use .  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .  
Many delegations underscored the primacy of radio as the most used and available traditional medium and expressed widespread support for the pilot project for the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations and the role of the Department in enabling developing nations to meet their information and communications needs .  
Invites multilateral and bilateral agencies to continue to strengthen and coordinate their activities for improving the capacity-building of developing countries , particularly least developed countries , including innovative methodologies for earmarking , assessing and monitoring technical assistance in the area of the sound management of hazardous chemicals and dangerous pharmaceutical products ;  
This technology information component of the framework could provide information on technical parameters , economic and environmental aspects of environmentally sound technologies and the identified technology needs of Parties not included in Annex II , particularly developing country Parties , as well as availability of environmentally sound technologies from developed countries and opportunities for technology transfer .  
Affirming that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter , taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty ,  
Requests Annex II Parties to provide detailed information , in their national communications and / or any other relevant reports , on their existing and planned support programmes to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures ;  
Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
Recognizing that low-lying and other small island countries , countries with low-lying coastal , arid and semi-arid areas or areas liable to floods , drought and desertification , and developing countries with fragile mountainous ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change ,  
The World Bank notes that if aggregate gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth in developing countries over the next 15 years were to equal the average attained during the 1990s , then progress in poverty reduction would be even slower than in scenario B , and the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day at the end of the forecast period would be only marginally lower than in 1998 .  
These should be , and in many cases are already being , applied by national Governments ( including in developing their international policies and objectives ) to ensure , through exercising good governance , that their citizens are involved in decision-making , that their citizens rights are protected and that all areas of government are sensitized to human rights obligations and goals .  
Within individual countries , whether developed or developing , globalization is by no means reflected in a more equitable distribution of income , but rather aggravates existing economic injustice , insofar as it favours the concentration of capital and wealth in the hands of private interests , while opening the way for exclusion , especially as lay-offs increase .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
While programmes intended to draw foreign investment , such as those involving the creation of economic industrial zones , have the advantage of encouraging economic growth in developing countries , they are accompanied by considerable social costs , involving , for example , massive violations of the fundamental rights of employees , who pay dearly for them .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
It is vital to restore North-South dialogue with two fundamental objectives : promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development as the priorities of cooperation and correcting the imbalances in the operation of the international economic system , which places developing countries at a clear disadvantage in their relationship with developed countries .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
The construction services sector is a fundamental economic activity which permeates all sectors of the economy : it is an instrument for employment creation and a tool for upgrading welfare ; it has a major role to play in providing basic and safe infrastructure achieving social and economic development objectives in developing countries ; and local firms and professionals should be fully involved in this process .  
As the implementation of the UR had not been satisfactory to Moroccos interests , it considered that the trade and support measures adopted by developed countries should be significantly reduced , particularly as agriculture constituted the principal economic activity of a large number of developing countries .  
The challenges faced by developing countries in terms of acute food insecurity should be carefully addressed to ensure adequate flexibility in national policy design to foster domestic agricultural production .  
In the long term , the agricultural production base of developing countries should be improved , and in the short term , bilateral and multilateral food aid schemes should be strengthened .  
He also agreed with the call for the establishment of concrete provisions relating to special and differential treatment and to provide developing countries with technical assistance to allow them to meet their legitimate needs , such as rural development and food security .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
The Meeting had presented a unique opportunity for public and private actors and trade negotiators and practitioners from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to express their views and concerns in an international forum .  
The representative of Singapore , speaking on behalf of the Asian Group and China , said the Expert Meeting had provided a unique opportunity for national experts from both developed and developing countries , as well as WTO members and non-members alike , to share their experience and to express their views and concerns in an international forum on the impact of AD / CVD actions .  
A possible strategy is to establish such a capacity gradually , by assisting in developing requisite training / pedagogical material and by providing assistance in course delivery in a developing country on a regional basis jointly with local professional associations ( freight forwarders , exporters etc . ) and / or academic institutions .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
FDI has become the single most important type of capital inflow to developing countries , accounting for about two thirds of all resource flows during the 1990s . 2 The fastest growth in all types of financial flows to developing countries and transition economies over the past decade was in portfolio equity investments , which rose sixfold to reach an annual average of more than $ 40-billion at the end of the decade . 
To tackle these problems , the landlocked developing countries need extensive cooperation and assistance from the international community , in order to deal with the complex legal frameworks of the multilateral trading system , their impact on external trade performance and competitiveness and effective participation in WTO negotiations .  
She called on the international community to commit additional financial resources and technical assistance for capacity-building in the physical infrastructure as well as for making available improved services and harmonized processes between the landlocked and transit developing countries .  
On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
With regard to the role of international agreements , he pointed out that so far recognition of the importance of technology transfer for developing countries was only formal in nature , expressed solely through the existence of the relevant international and regional arrangements , but that further refinement of those arrangements was needed in order to facilitate the practical possibilities of their actual implementation .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
Given the attention being paid to international norms for products entering trade , it was an important step that development partners committed to providing assistance to least developed countries in developing infrastructure to ensure quality control and conformity to international standards of their products and to avoiding taking unilateral action in a manner inconsistent with the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization .  
The least developed countries committed to pursuing balance policies that sought to limit transmission of external shock into the domestic economy while promoting gradual liberalization , and developing safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable segments of the population against the consequences of external shocks .  
One of the new posts would be dedicated to developing and assisting in the use of visual tools for presentations , briefings and reports , and for preparing and updating maps related to all areas of interest of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations ; the other operations officer would be responsible for maximizing the use of existing online information sources and for maintaining and improving the information flow of documents and reports between the Situation Centre and the other units of the Department .  
The Section will be responsible for mid - and long-term planning , including succession planning , developing mission modules / templates , determining staffing tables and levels , anticipating future skills requirements , analysing and monitoring human resource trends , identifying new sources of recruitment , and managing the civilian rapid deployment capability .  
Under the direct supervision of the Chief , GIS Cell ( GISC ) , the incumbent would be responsible for the overall operating , developing and implementing of the GIS-related matters in terms of logistics in peacekeeping operations ; provide geographic / terrain analysis using GIS technology , produce terrain studies and predict the effects of weather , terrain and logistics situations in peacekeeping operations , compile textual , graphic products from text , electronic format of geographic data ( vector , raster , satellite images ) and other sources of data .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
The Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit will be considerably strengthened and is intended to be at the heart of a new system by which the Organization learns from its peacekeeping experience , developing policies , procedures and related operational tools that are incorporated into the planning and conduct of both ongoing and future missions .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
Appeals to the international community , United Nations bodies , international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to allocate substantial new and additional resources , including through the new global fund to fight HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , launched by the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries at its Genoa Summit in 2001 and by the Secretary-General , for developing countries , particularly in Africa , with a view to enabling them to fully implement the Plan of Action adopted in Abuja for the Roll Back Malaria initiative ;  
The Assembly made a number of recommendations to Governments and Member States , in particular to countries of origin and destination , calling on them to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States .  
Today , encouraging and promoting international cooperation to combat infectious diseases , which are again an emerging global threat to all developed or developing countries is proved to be more essential than ever .  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions , should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
The analytical studies confirmed that weak infrastructures and inefficient transit operations result in high transport costs and are major impediments to trade expansion and sustainable development in many landlocked and transit developing countries .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
Furthermore , the astronomical costs involved in developing a space-based defence system , taken together with those incurred to counter such a move , would inevitably result in heightened strategic competition and greater mutual vulnerability and further deepen the global economic crisis .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
In the resolution , the Assembly , inter alia , urged the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that were not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or were inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravened the basic principles of the multilateral trading system .  
In accordance with paragraph 2 of the resolution , our country is making steady and active efforts to prevent the use , in violation of decisions made by the relevant United Nations organs , of unilateral measures of economic and political coercion inconsistent with the norms of international law and the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations as a means of applying pressure on independent developing States .  
The United Nations and other organizations , whether of an international or regional character , have adopted an enormous number of resolutions condemning the use of unilateral coercive economic measures because of the great damage they do to the economies of the developing countries and their negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a just and non-discriminatory trading system .  
The Commission on Human Rights itself has stated that the application of unilateral coercive economic measures has an adverse effect on the social and humanitarian situation of developing countries .  
For this reason , the Government of the Republic of Mali believes that the international community should adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and are contrary to the basic principles of the international trading system .  
However , favourable external conditions were equally necessary ; the current international economic system must be reformed to meet the challenges of globalization and growing interdependence among countries and made more equitable by increasing the decision-making power of the developing countries .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
His Government would be giving top priority in the coming four years to creating an information society based on science and new technologies , by , inter alia , introducing computer education for students , teachers and civil servants , and using computer networks to centralize access to government services ; developing a long-term science and technology strategy ; promoting electronic business ; and using an integrated communications network to fight organized crime , drug-dealing and illegal immigration .  
That had been particularly evident during negotiations on the agenda for the forthcoming World Trade Organization ( WTO ) Ministerial Conference , for , despite high-level pronouncements that trade should promote development , the negotiations had revolved around the need to secure additional benefits for developed countries as a precondition for discussing issues that were critical to the development of most developing countries . 
In that connection he stressed the need for an open , equitable , predictable , non-discriminatory and rule-based multilateral trading system and expressed the hope that the forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would achieve a new consensus model that took into account the needs and priorities of the developing world . 
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
She stressed the need to strengthen normative , legislative and organizational frameworks in the interests of a stable and predictable world economy , adding that one way to facilitate the developing countries integration into that economy was to provide sufficient development funding ; the International Conference on Financing for Development could play an important role in that .  
Because of the many obstacles that developing landlocked countries faced in international trade , especially high transport costs which made their exports expensive and less competitive , special attention should be given to the interests of those countries in the next round of trade negotiations .  
His delegation sincerely hoped that the International Conference on Financing for Development would be able to address in a more meaningful way the marginalization of developing countries with a view to changing the decision-making processes , adjusting the terms of trade , rescheduling the external debt and mobilizing public and private capital flows at national and international levels .  
He expressed the hope that the outcomes of the Fourth World Tourism Organization Ministerial Conference and the World Summit on Sustainable Development could provide help to developing countries in their efforts , inter alia , to feed the poor and provide shelter ; halt and reverse the spread of HIV / AIDS ; provide safe drinking water ; and offer employment to the millions of unemployed youth .  
International trade in the developing countries exports was scant , while the developed countries absorbed by far the most global foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , in contrast to the drastic decline of investment in the developing countries , giving the former even more clout in the world economy .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
In the developing countries generally , limited infrastructure , inadequate regulatory systems , access costs and lack of human resources were serious handicaps to connectivity and the use of information and communication technologies , which were , moreover , not geared to their languages or their social and cultural contexts . 
The theme of the dialogue , entitled Responding to globalization : facilitating the integration of developing countries into the world economy in the twenty-first century , was considered to be particularly important and timely in the context of the current global economic slowdown , and emphasized the urgent need for poverty eradication strategies .  
This required revival of global economic growth , in a sustainable and more equitable manner , coupled with open markets and technical assistance for developing countries , and the removal of barriers to free exchange and investment within the developing world .  
In order to promote a more equitable distribution of the benefits of globalization , the adequate representation and broad and meaningful participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting should be realized .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
In this context , and given the decline in official development assistance , the former Secretary-General of the United Nations , Mr . Javier Prez de Cullar , speaking on the subject of the link between disarmament and development on 11 June at the opening of a workshop in Lima , noted that developing countries needed to rely more on their own resources and , to that end , to re-examine the percentage of their gross domestic product and national budgets used for military spending .  
He reaffirmed his countrys full support for the recommendations contained in the outcome documents of the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly , which had enhanced the international communitys awareness of the nature of the social and developmental problems facing the worlds peoples , particularly in developing and least developed countries .  
Official and unofficial assistance to developing countries must be increased , their debt burden must be alleviated and the conditions governing their access to technology for peaceful uses and the access of their products to global markets must be eased to enable those countries to carry out appropriate reforms of their social and development institutions , diversify their sources of national income , create job opportunities for their nationals , provide education , health and social welfare services and combat chronic and epidemic diseases , especially HIV / AIDS .  
On instructions from His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan , President of the United Arab Emirates , to make the individual in that State the pivot and the purpose of national development endeavours , the State had adopted legislation , policies and plans aimed at developing national human resources through the development and modernization of educational , health and cultural institutions and the establishment of centres to train young people and develop their scientific and technological skills in accordance with national development needs .  
He hoped that the Committees discussions at the current session would help to promote the role of the United Nations in designing and coordinating development policies and programmes in developing countries and to revitalize an approach to international development and social cooperation that was based on equality among peoples and the right of States to choose their own development course and achieve a better future for their societies in accordance with their independent national policies and interests .  
First of all , an equitable international economic order should be established which did not blindly impose globalization on developing countries but instead included an equitable trading system , reform of the international financial institutions and a solution to the external debt problem .  
Austria congratulated the Commission secretariat on organizing a Colloquium on Privately Financed Infrastructure in Vienna in July and endorsed the initiative to establish a Working Group to draft a core model law , because a legislative and regulatory framework for infrastructure projects would send a reassuring signal to all potential private investors and might help to attract private investment for infrastructure projects in developing States .  
The meeting recommended strengthening cooperation between the League of Arab States and the United Nations on humanitarian issues , particularly building capacity for monitoring emergencies and coordinating regional relief operations ; developing training and capacity-building programmes , with special reference to early warning and preparedness systems ; and convening a regional workshop on humanitarian emergency assistance for victims of natural disasters and complex emergencies .  
It further urged the United Nations to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to disseminate widely a balanced and objective presentation of Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity .  
It is no secret to Member States that it is dangerous to dump any form of radioactive waste , which could be used in radiological warfare , as well as having other harmful effects on regional and international peace , especially in developing countries .  
Funding for those activities should be sufficient , secure and stable , be provided on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and be commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
It was therefore the role of the International Conference on Financing for Development to provide developing countries with realistic advice enabling them to reformulate domestic policies and review regulatory constraints that were currently hampering the growth of the private sector and discouraging foreign investment .  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
In order to promote domestic savings , attract foreign investment , increase trade revenue , manage external debt and make the most effective use of official development assistance , developing countries needed to have essential human resources and , therefore , to train experts in those fields .  
Commending the positive and constructive role played by refugee-hosting countries and recognizing at the same time the heavy burden borne by some , particularly developing countries and countries with economies in transition , as well as the protracted nature of many refugee situations and the absence of timely and safe solutions ,  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
Urges concerned Governments , in particular those of the countries of origin and destination , to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States , and to establish and maintain continuing dialogues to facilitate the exchange of information ;  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
Within the framework of the trade liberalization that was advocated so much at the current time , there was a proliferation of coercive unilateral economic measures dictated by the developed countries with regard to developing countries for purely political purposes .  
The endeavour to reverse the marginalization of developing countries , to promote their sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to facilitate their integration into the world economy had led the international community to search for integral and balanced global arrangements .  
They had been asked to establish an environment conducive to capital flows , yet foreign direct investment flows to the developing countries were continually shrinking and were expected to diminish by another 6 per cent in 2001 , especially since the climate in the developed countries was more uncertain , the risks were greater and investment returns were lower . 
The report also stated that , according to preliminary estimates , the developing world would experience slower growth in its export volumes in 2001 , and that growth forecasts had been revised downwards even prior to the terrorist attacks ; the growth of volume of world trade was expected to drop to 4 per cent from 12 per cent in 2000 , and the global volume of imports and exports would have difficulty withstanding the declines in the prices of primary commodities and of manufactured exports .  
Recommends that , within existing budgetary resources or , where necessary , with the help of extrabudgetary or voluntary resources , the concerned specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system provide to the bodies responsible for the advancement of women , information that would enable them to undertake a precise and in-depth analysis of the situation of older women , including developing , if necessary , specific new methods for data collection ;  
Recognizing the important dimension and role of tourism as a positive instrument towards the alleviation of poverty and the improvement of the quality of life for all people , its potential to make a contribution to economic and social development , especially of the developing countries , and its emergence as a vital force for the promotion of international understanding , peace and prosperity ,  
The report of the Secretary-General contained many useful proposals designed to strengthen the operational activities of the United Nations system , but it was important to ensure that the fundamental characteristics of those activities , namely their universal , voluntary and grant-based nature , as well as their ability to respond to the needs of developing countries in a flexible and timely manner , were maintained .  
He outlined the main activities undertaken by the secretariat , where priority continued to be given to least developed countries , and the progress achieved with regard to the utilization of developing countries capacities in the implementation of technical cooperation and with respect to the financial sustainability of selected technical cooperation programmes .  
Reiterates its call upon all relevant funding institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as regional funding institutions and non-governmental organizations , to support , as appropriate , the efforts being made for the development of the renewable energy sector in developing countries on the basis of environment-friendly renewable sources of energy of demonstrated viability , while taking fully into account the development structure of energy-based economies of developing countries , and to assist in the attainment of the levels of investment necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
They included the widening economic gap between countries of the South and countries of the North ; the existence in the countries of the North of a labour market capable of absorbing labour from countries of the South in specialized areas of technology ; the economic recession in developing countries ; increasing unemployment and inflation ; and the expansion of political conflicts , including in Africa , that increased insecurity and poverty .  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
As a primary sponsor of that draft resolution , South Africa is particularly pleased that the Secretariat managed to source from existing budgetary provisions adequate funding for the conference servicing required for the first biennial meeting of States contemplated in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution , as well as for the meetings of a group of experts to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument for tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , referred to in paragraph 10 .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Recognizes the urgent need to build stronger South institutions , including policy research and development institutions and centres of excellence , especially at the regional , inter-regional and global levels , and to have linkages among them through networking arrangements , and by making more effective use of the Souths institutional capacity , so as to improve South-South knowledge-sharing , capacity-building and information flow , and policy analysis and coordination among developing countries on major development issues of common concern ;  
Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening the international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction ;  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
While these norms and standards were almost invariably introduced with the intention of promoting positive outcomes , such as public safety and health , environmental protection and economic stability , they also restrained the capacity of developing countries to take the low value-added path to global integration .  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Also requests the Secretary-General to seek views of Member States on the desirability of convening a high-level policy consultation at the governmental level with a view to setting priorities and developing critical strategies that would meet the manifold challenges faced by rural women ;  
The purpose of the council was to develop a comprehensive national programme to take advantage of the peaceful applications of the use of outer space and to attain the technological and development objectives of the State , including the adoption of satellite technology for the study of desert regions , while training scientific personnel , developing an Egyptian space programme and using space technology and its applications in the development of local industry .  
If international cooperation failed to expand , it would be difficult for many developing countries to create a reliable scientific and educational base for the sustainable development of space technology .  
Stresses the need for partnership among Governments of the affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized companies to promote training in , access to and use of technologies to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters , and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed ;  
Recognizing that , while it is the primary responsibility of States to attain economic and social development and to achieve the development and poverty eradication goals as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , the international community should support the efforts of the developing countries to eradicate poverty and ensure basic social protection and to promote an enabling international environment ,  
Also recognizes the critical need for countries to undertake economic , institutional and regulatory reforms to support wide trade liberalization and to create an enabling environment in which trade can truly serve as an engine for economic growth and development and , in this regard , calls upon the international community to continue to support the capacity-building efforts of developing countries , taking into account their national circumstances ;  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20 / 20 initiative , which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty ;  
Stressing the need for the international community to demonstrate the firm political determination required to utilize scientific and technical knowledge to reduce the vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards , taking into account the particular needs of developing countries ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Reaffirms the need for strengthening the international framework for the improvement of early warning systems and disaster preparedness by developing an effective international mechanism for early warning , including the transfer of technology related to early warning to developing countries , which ensures that vulnerable people receive appropriate and timely information , as well as expanding and improving existing systems , in particular those under the auspices of the United Nations , as an integral part of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction ;  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and relevant organizations to give priority to assisting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies and integrating gender concerns into national programmes , including by providing adequate resources to operational activities for development in support of the efforts of Governments to ensure , inter alia , full and equal access of women to health care , capital , education , training and technology , as well as full and equal participation in all decision-making ;  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .
