"  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
And after all the speeches from these international " super salesmen " of technology , the conference closed out with remarks by William Magee , founder of Operation Smile , a volunteer medical organization .

The European Union believes that there are compelling reasons for reforming the United Nations system , particularly in the economic , social and related fields , so that it can meet the growing challenges of a complex and interdependent world , preserve its relevance in that world and make a meaningful contribution to sustainable development .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
The UNEP corporate programme framework 1994-1995 stated that reliable flows of objective and meaningful information are critical to the mobilization of an environmentally aware and educated public and to the stimulation of effective decision-making .

The war in southern Sudan , which began four decades ago and which , with the exception of the relative calm between 1972 and 1983 , has continued unabated , has claimed the lives of well over 1-million persons and has hindered , if not completely thwarted , efforts to move the country along a path of meaningful and lasting progress .

Factors such as deprivation of education , limited meaningful human contact and easy access to sophisticated weapons , coupled with the experience of the cruelties of war , destroy the value system of many young people , resulting in a failure to discourage them from participating in violent activities .  
NULLThe events described above , coupled with other political and military developments within the Republic of Croatia and the contiguous territories of the former Yugoslavia , as well as the frequently declared intention of the Croatian authorities to recover lost territories by other means if negotiations did not succeed , made it very difficult to resume meaningful negotiations and bring them to a successful conclusion .

This being the situation , delegations and groups of delegations have to be accommodating to the extent possible so as to facilitate the efficient and meaningful functioning of the Conference , bearing in mind that it has a responsibility towards the entire international community , which is a task well beyond serving the national interests of the Conference 's membership .  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
In this connection , and without taking away from steps that have already been or are being taken , we feel that further efforts are needed to promote the emergence of a new approach through the adoption of meaningful measures of nuclear disarmament , which incontrovertibly remains the absolute priority in achieving the goal of general and complete disarmament which the international community set for itself at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .

Nevertheless , determined as I believe we should be to go ahead , undeterred by the intimidation , and in view of the need to adhere to the shortest possible time-frame , I have decided to begin the registration , based on positive assurances by the Indonesian authorities , on the condition that meaningful , visible improvements in the security situation will be observed in the immediate future .  
The effective participation of developing countries in new multilateral trade negotiations will require not only their ability to formulate and effectively pursue proposals in each agreed area of the negotiations , but also the political will of their developed partners to treat all issues of interest to developing countries on an equal basis , thus opening the way to meaningful solutions for developing countries .

Thirdly , the failure of the Security Council to play any meaningful role during the past nine months regarding the ongoing events in the occupied Palestinian territories , including Jerusalem , in the face of the oppression and brutality inflicted upon the Palestinians , and the failure to provide international protection for the Palestinian people , indeed represent a challenge to the credibility of the Security Council and its ability to fulfil its duties in a firm and consistent manner that is free of double standards .

In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .
