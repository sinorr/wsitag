Most comrades are now seizing time to study and work hard ; but , undeniably , there still exist many phenomena of not treasuring time : a lot of valuable time is wasted by overstaffing , buck-passing , mountains of documents , oceans of meetings , empty talk , platitudes , fault-finding , meaningless debate , blind decision-making , misguided and arbitrary command , absent-mindedness , doing nothing , extravagant living , and pleasure-seeking .  All this is truly painful to see and worrisome .  
In order to ensure stringent and impartial law enforcement and prevent power abuse , the public security organs at various levels have also persistently and unremittingly addressed in a focused way such problems as misuse of coercive measures , extended custody , extortion of confession by torture , arbitrary imposition of fines , and arbitrary collection of fees .  As a result , the law-enforcement work of the public security community has become more regularized and the quality of law enforcement has improved rather significantly .  
The Mormon Church , for instance , boasts of 4.6-million followers .  Evil cults have their own characteristics : authoritative leader , anti-social mode of actions , absolute loyalty to chieftains and to the group one belongs , consciousness of being persecuted , mysterious and secret internal organization , arbitrary self-advertisement , exclusiveness , strict discipline , ideological control and manipulation of fellow believers , compelled service and preaching activities .  
At a meeting to deliberate the " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " held at the UN headquarters in New York on 24 April 2000 , on behalf of the international community , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan explicitly voiced his opposition to NMD and his strong misgivings about the enormous destruction the US arbitrary move might bring to the international arms control and nuclear disarmament .  
As a rule , such U.S . official " human rights reports " flagrantly criticize the human rights situations in other countries .  They cite hearsay of one kind or another , but can not present any valid evidence .  Because of this , the reports have been regarded by international public opinion as a combination of " misinformation , exaggerations , groundless accusations , and lopsided and arbitrary conclusions " .  
The correct way to adapt oneself to the new challenges in international security , safeguard world peace , and protect the legitimate security interests of different countries is not to undermine the " ABM Treaty " but to push forward the establishment of a new , just , and rational international political order , abandon power politics and the arbitrary use of force in international affairs , and further strengthen regional and international security .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : Since last year , a number of counties and cities in Anhui Province and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out the trial reform of taxes and charges in rural areas in accordance with the arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council , and have achieved initial good results .  First , the peasants ' burdens have been reduced by a great extent and the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " has been effectively curtailed .  
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
Furthermore , the relevant department has conducted the following special rectification on a large scale : Straightening out electricity charges ; standardizing payments of charges for railroad , traffic , and public security services ; stopping arbitrary ranking , arbitrary evaluations , and arbitrary inspections ; rectifying intermediary service charges ; curbing arbitrary collections of charges from foreign-invested enterprises ; bringing order out of arbitrary collections of charges related to traffic and vehicles ; and reducing town and township enterprises ' burden .  These have all resolved some outstanding problems many enterprises had strong complaints about .  
Contrary to what some have alleged , there has been no unfair targetting of certain demonstrators by the police ; there has been no arbitrary or improper use of the discretion to prosecute ; no heavy penalties have been imposed on demonstrators ; and there is no evidence whatsoever that the current law unfairly restricts the right to peaceful assembly .  
With reference to the mainland 's ill-considered and arbitrary actions , some political commentators put forward the interpretation that with the Communist Party of China 's 16th national congress imminent and a new leadership line-up about to emerge , mainland politicians jostling for positions of power were eager to put on an impressive performance , so they adopted a more hawkish posture .  
In these circumstances , the Russianspeaking population of Latvia is becoming an easy target for radical nationalist bureaucrats performing arbitrary and lawless acts with the secret but , in fact , direct connivance of the political leadership .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , summary and arbitrary executions , disappearances , arbitrary detentions , all forms of racism , racial discrimination and apartheid , foreign occupation and alien domination , xenophobia , poverty , hunger and other denials of economic , social and cultural rights , religious intolerance , terrorism , discrimination against women and lack of the rule of law .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
Mindful of the dismay and condemnation expressed by the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , at the continuing occurrence of gross and systematic violations of human rights , including summary and arbitrary executions ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned by the deterioration of the overall human rights situation in Iraq and the continued massive and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , such as summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , enforced or involuntary disappearances , arbitrary arrests and detentions , lack of due process and the rule of law , and of freedom of thought , of expression , of association and of access to food and health care ,  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
Voluntary repatriation continues to be the preferred durable solution to the refugee problem in the region , but the recurring internal security problems in Rwanda , coupled with arbitrary arrests throughout the country , have emerged as major obstacles preventing refugees from returning .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or summary and arbitrary detention , all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , denial of economic , social and cultural rights and religious intolerance .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
NULLThe Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 61 ) mentioned that in a number of cases that had come before him in 1994 , it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
NULL CONTINI ( France ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that his delegation deeply regretted the surprising , arbitrary and unjust connection drawn at the previous meeting by the representative of Papua New Guinea between the elimination of racism and nuclear testing . 
For three years , summary and extrajudicial executions , enforced disappearances , arbitrary arrest , rape , torture , and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment inflicted by agents of the State , threats , extortion , and destruction or confiscation of property were a part of daily life for the people .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious , and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial and forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
this regard , we have read with grave concern the latest report of the Secretary-General , further confirming earlier reports that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most , all in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
Our collective reflection clearly revealed that , without the United Nations , the world would only have been more violent , more unstable and insecure , more unjust and cruel especially to the weak , who are prey to power politics and arbitrary decisions .  
The ideal way of achieving this objective is not by applying arbitrary measures in the form of cutbacks , mass dismissals or redeployment , but by applying the guidelines of the General Assembly on personnel issues consistently , while observing and bolstering the principle that the Secretariat must be accountable in a strict and transparent fashion for the execution of the mandates entrusted to it by the Organization 's only universal organ that is , the General Assembly .  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
The High Commissioner raised such matters as : arbitrary and preventive detention ; the treatment of detainees , including cases of custodial rape by members of the police and security forces ; cases of enforced disappearance ; failure to take judicial action against police officers accused of violations of human rights ; the partial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to disturbed areas of the country ; social inequalities relating to the caste system ; and policies adopted to eliminate the caste of untouchable .  
The obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and to bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions should be considered of the utmost importance in the context of the protection of the fundamental right to life .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;

Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " .  The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the second half of June 1996 .  
The Mission considers that the deterioration of the conditions in which defendants are held pending trial , and the lengthening of sentences , could have a generalized adverse impact on the protection of individuals against the arbitrary use of State power , while paradoxically failing to achieve the declared aim of protecting the human rights of crime victims .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the first half of July 1996 .  
The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
Condemn the serious crimes and inhuman atrocities of genocide , massacres , extrajudicial killings , reprisal killings , arbitrary detention , torture , use of rape as an instrument of suppression , burning of houses , villages and townships , and destruction and desecration of holy places , committed by the Indian Government , through its military and paramilitary personnel , renegades and mercenaries , in Jammu and Kashmir during the last seven years ;

It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " . d / The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
The Commission on Human Rights , by its resolution 1982 / 29 of 11 March 1982 , recommended that the Economic and Social Council request the Chairman of the Commission to appoint an individual of recognized international standing as special rapporteur to submit a comprehensive report to the Commission at its thirty-ninth session on the occurrence and extent of the practice of summary or arbitrary executions , together with his conclusions and recommendations .  
Urgent transmissions were made by the Special Rapporteur in cases that evinced a fear of imminent extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; these cases included death threats and fear of imminent execution of death sentences in contravention of the limitations on capital punishment set forth in the pertinent international instruments .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that follow-up efforts should focus on how Governments comply with their obligation under international law to conduct full , independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions transmitted to them , with a view to clarifying the circumstances , identifying and prosecuting those responsible , granting compensation to the victims or their families and preventing future violations .  
It is the obligation of Governments to carry out exhaustive and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of the right to life , to identify , bring to justice and punish their perpetrators , to grant compensation to the victims or their families , and to take effective measures to avoid future recurrence of such violations .  The Special Rapporteur has noted that impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of violations of human rights , and , in particular , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Further , a multitude of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing grossly disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions are arbitrary when measured by international standards .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .  
The Commission continued to alert the international community to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; torture and enforced disappearance ; arbitrary detention ; violence against women , children and vulnerable groups ; the problem of internally displaced persons , extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , etc .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) referred to a number of cases that had come before him in 1995 , in which it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
The present report is a joint interim report submitted to the General Assembly by Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and Mr . Param Cumaraswamy , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the independence of judges and lawyers , pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 79 of 23 April 1996 , entitled " Situation of human rights in Nigeria " .  2 .  The report is divided into five chapters .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , in his report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) cited information that had been brought to his attention in 1995 concerning the secret trials held before the Special Military Court in Lagos of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an alleged attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions remains deeply concerned about the application of the death penalty in Nigeria ; the use of force by law enforcement officials ; the continuing occurrence of communal violence and apparent lack of preventive measures ; and extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , the large number of deaths in detention and the high rate of impunity ;  
As in the preceding months , the mission of observers continues to received numerous allegations of massacres , killings , infringements of personal freedom and security , forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the interior of Burundi , especially in the provinces of Muramvya , Gitega , Kayanza , Cibitoke and Bubanza , allegations which are difficult or take a long time to verify because of the aforementioned security constraints . 
Aside from the heavy tribute paid daily in numerous human lives in particular by the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons the refugees who are returning from Zaire by the thousands , fleeing the cataclysm abroad , are faced with tragic conditions in their own country , Burundi , and are being throttled by an embargo which is arbitrary in every way .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
With regard to the interim report on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights ( A / 51 / 457 ) , he noted that the Special Rapporteur , in paragraph 99 of his report , emphasized that Governments must respect the right to life of all persons , even when they demonstrated total disregard for the lives of others .  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
The observation of the Special Rapporteur in paragraph 68 that " a great reluctance of the international community to use the term ' genocide ' " is not rooted , as the Special Rapporteur would like it , in the alleged " reluctance " but in the fact that such a position is contrary to international law , while the prevailing practice of certain political bodies and some United Nations Special Rapporteurs to invest genocide with arbitrary definitions has been politically motivated .  
A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .  
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 58 on this situation decided to request " the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Zaire and on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and a member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to carry out a joint mission to investigate allegations of massacres and other issues affecting human rights which arise from the situation prevailing in eastern Zaire since September 1996 " .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Further , it should be emphasized that all allegations contained in the interim report had been transmitted to the Government during the course of 1996 by special rapporteurs and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights , including the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , on the question of torture and on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention .  
For three years the daily life of Haitians was marked by murders , summary and extrajudicial executions , enforced disappearances , arbitrary arrests , rape , torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , extortion , and destruction or confiscation of property .  
The growing international concern at such problems as freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention , protection against all forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , circumstances and conditions of detention and imprisonment , and humanization of criminal justice were cornerstones of the protection of human rights .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
Without seeking to be exhaustive in the present interim report , the Special Rapporteur would nevertheless like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly a number of allegations of human rights violations transmitted to him during the period under consideration , particularly as regards the right to life and physical integrity , arrests and arbitrary detentions and torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
Any person may take quick , expedient action to protect himself , as long as no other more appropriate judicial means exist , against any immediate or potential act or omission of public authorities or any individuals , harming , restricting , altering or threatening rights and guarantees recognized by this Constitution , by a treaty or by a law , in either an arbitrary or a manifestly illegal manner . . . .  
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation has interpreted these provisions as meaning that the basis for the guarantee of equality before the law is the provision of equal treatment to people in reasonably equal circumstances ; this guarantee therefore does not prevent the legislator from giving different consideration to situations he believes to be different , provided that such distinctions are not made using arbitrary criteria leading to undue favour or prejudice , undue personal or class advantages or disadvantages or unlawful persecution .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
The allegations of summary , arbitrary and extrajudicial executions reported to him from many parts of the country were not surprising , because Iraqi legislation routinely prescribed the death penalty , even for minor offences , and also because the special security services and important figures in the regime had the power to take peoples lives at will ; the Iraqi Government made no attempt whatsoever to change that state of affairs , which it even justified on the grounds that the situation was difficult and that crime was on the increase .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
In this way , we can avoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are irrelevant to such interests , but affect narrow regional calculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues of international peace and security .  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
It also refers to the arbitrary and coercive measures undertaken against the Arab population , such as administrative detention , collective punishment , the demolition of homes , curfews , the forcible transfer of Bedouin population , closures , impeding the free movement of people and , in particular , the restriction that prevents them from travelling through Jerusalem between the north and south of the country .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
In addition to the Special Rapporteur 's participation in the special rapporteurs ' meeting and in joint urgent actions transmitted to Governments , in 1996 the Special Rapporteur requested to undertake a joint mission to Nigeria with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Decides to consider the question of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions as a matter of priority at its fifty _ fourth session under the item entitled Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;

The Ministerial Council observed with great concern the continuing deadlock and deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East and the growing danger of its imminent breakdown as a result of the arbitrary policies and provocative practices pursued by the Israeli Government , with its insistence on building a new settlement in Jerusalem , expanding settlements in the occupied Arab territories and reneging on its commitments relating to the implementation of agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
The systematic and planned killing , deportation , rape , summary execution , abduction , arbitrary detention and looting was perpetrated by the Taliban while Pakistani military personnel accompanied and assisted the Taliban .  
In most of the cases reported to the Working Group , the sources alleged that the individuals are being held incommunicado and they express a fear that the victims may be subjected to torture or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
Such an approach , based on arbitrary , biased positions and inaccurate conclusions is not acceptable , nor does it serve for the protection and promotion of human rights , reflecting instead partial political interests .  
His delegation supported the phasing out of gratis personnel and their replacement by international civil servants , and was opposed to any arbitrary financial ceiling that might adversely affect backstopping of peacekeeping operations .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
The United Arab Emirates , which considered Israels actions to be unlawful , strongly condemned Israels arbitrary rule and immoral acts : collective punishment , the blockade of towns and villages , the profanation of Muslim sacred objects and places of worship , violence and the arbitrary detention and murder of innocent , peaceful inhabitants , including women and children . 
Strongly condemns summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings , enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , and calls upon the Government of Iraq to provide an accounting for the clean-out of prisons where there is credible evidence of mass summary executions ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial and arbitrary executions , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of expression , assembly , association and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
During their joint visit to Colombia in October 1994 , the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on torture both drew attention to the need to strengthen the ordinary justice system to make it universally more efficient , so that it would no longer be necessary to resort to special justice systems , such as the system of regional justice ( see report E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 111 ) .  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
The wide disrespect of the rule of law , including increasing numbers of arbitrary and politically motivated arrests and detentions , detentions without trial , sometimes without the knowledge of the families of detainees , and the abuse of the judicial process , including trial of detainees in secrecy without proper legal representation , and the inhuman treatment of prisoners , leading to illness and deaths in custody , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;

Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
Since the arbitrary termination of the autonomy of Kosovo by the Belgrade authorities in 1989 , we , together with the international community , have watched with great distress the Serbian acts of atrocities against the innocent and hard-working people of Kosovo and the campaigns of ethnic cleansing that have been reminiscent of the preceding sinister acts against the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina that were also committed by the Serbs .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation , and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
Rather than relying on artificial and arbitrary time-frames unrelated to need or performance , the expression of special and differential treatment should be linked to specific economic and social criteria .  
The Appellate Body concluded that the United States measure was falling within the exception covered by subparagraph ( g ) of article XX , but went on to state that any recourse to an exception had to satisfy the requirements of article XX in that it should not be applied in a manner constituting an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or be a disguised restriction on international trade .  
For some , the central piece in the struggle is the reform of the legal system , that is to say , the search for a system that is less arbitrary , less driven by ideology , less cruel towards its dissidents and criminals ; in short a system based on the rule of law built around respect for the personal dignity of all individuals .  
All international disputes and regional conflicts should be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through peaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of equality , rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of force based on the power of military superiority .  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Warfare in the central highlands in April and May involved vicious attacks against civilians , including the summary execution of women and children , forced and involuntary displacement , the looting and burning of homes , arbitrary detention and the use of forced labour . 
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
The concept of non _ discrimination on the basis of national origin should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
The Lebanese Government strongly condemns Israel 's arbitrary actions against the Lebanese civilian population , and it requests you to do your utmost to induce the Israeli authorities concerned to halt these inhuman and unlawful practices and , at last , to close down the Khiyam centre that they maintain inside Lebanese territory .  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
For this reason , countries with a well established tradition of private participation in infrastructure projects have developed a series of control mechanisms and remedies to protect government contractors against arbitrary or improper acts by public authorities , such as access to impartial dispute settlement bodies and full compensation schemes for governmental wrongdoing .  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued , so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example , in the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Ms . A . Jahangir , in her report to the Commission at its fifty-fifth session ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 ) stated that the execution of a death sentence passed after a trial in which basic fair trial standards , as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , were not respected , constituted a violation of the right to life .  
The Special Rapporteur , in an addendum to her report , on country situations ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 / Add . 1 ) , stated that she had received numerous allegations concerning extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions committed by armed insurgent groups in Sierra Leone .  
Through such interim decisions , the treaty bodies ( as well as some of the Commissions special procedures mechanisms such as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ) have obtained temporary or permanent relief for countless potential victims in cases concerning , for example , stays of imminent execution , commutation of death sentences , or deferrals of extradition , expulsion or deportation orders .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
The Working Group was concerned at the continuing abusive treatment of women , including custodial deaths , torture , rape , abduction , disappearances , arbitrary arrests , forced abortions and sterilizations , harassment and arson by security forces , including military and police forces , or by other governmental authorities , particularly where separatist movements were reported .  
The Working Group was concerned at the allegations of the violations of the human rights of women , including widespread arbitrary arrest , use of excessive force during arrests , incommunicado detention , prolonged administrative detention , detention of minors , torture and ill-treatment , unfair trial and forcible exile of political opponents and prisoners .  
The adoption of a rigid classification of economic , social and cultural rights which puts them , by definition , beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and interdependent .  
That violence is particularly evident during raids in which large numbers of more or less arbitrary and often violent arrests are made , often on the basis of being the wrong sort 8 ] , and the burden of proof of legal status rests with the accused : many foreigners , even South Africans , have spent months in prison like this , as their status can sometimes be difficult to determine . 
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
With respect to cases of honour killing considered by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expressed his concern in regard to these instances of summary execution and urged the Governments concerned to bring those responsible to justice .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
On the contrary , arbitrary detentions continued to occur throughout the year , by order of higher authority , which means that imprisonment is decided by the executive power , subject to no control whatsoever by the judicial authorities .  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Reiterates its requests that the relevant special rapporteurs and the special mechanisms of the Commission undertake missions to the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation without delay and expresses serious concern that the thematic special rapporteurs or representatives on the question of torture , on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on internally displaced persons , who have requested to undertake visits have not yet received an answer and urges the Government of the Russian Federation to give favourable consideration to their requests as a matter of priority ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 55 / 111 of 4 December 2000 , in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty-seventh session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures , including legal and judicial measures in order to bring an end to impunity , to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with the mandate of the High Commissioner established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
Alarmed by the reality of daily violations of childrens rights , including the right to life , to physical security and to freedom from arbitrary detention , torture and any form of exploitation , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , as laid out in relevant international instruments ,  
In accordance with the now general practice of using the term discrimination exclusively to designate arbitrary distinctions , the term positive discrimination is a contradictio in terminis : either the distinction in question is justified and legitimate , because not arbitrary , and can not be called discrimination , or the distinction in question is unjustified or illegitimate , because arbitrary , and should not be labelled positive .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
The General Assemblys political decision on the level of the regular budget was often arbitrary and sometimes appeared to be motivated by budgetary and economic trends in national Governments or by what Member States contributed to other United Nations operations or entities .  
Concerning the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , of the 167 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 63 were based on information communicated by local or regional non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , 78 on information provided by international NGOs in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council , and 26 by private sources .  
At the systematic policy of the Government of Myanmar of persecuting the democratic opposition , National League for Democracy members and their families , as well as ethnic opposition parties , and at the use by the Government of intimidatory methods such as arbitrary arrest and detention , abuse of the legal system , including harsh long-term prison sentences , which has forced many to refrain from exercising their legitimate political rights ;  
The deterioration of the human rights situation and the continuing pattern of gross and systematic violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement ;

Most comrades are now seizing time to study and work hard ; but , undeniably , there still exist many phenomena of not treasuring time : a lot of valuable time is wasted by overstaffing , buck-passing , mountains of documents , oceans of meetings , empty talk , platitudes , fault-finding , meaningless debate , blind decision-making , misguided and arbitrary command , absent-mindedness , doing nothing , extravagant living , and pleasure-seeking .  All this is truly painful to see and worrisome .  
In order to ensure stringent and impartial law enforcement and prevent power abuse , the public security organs at various levels have also persistently and unremittingly addressed in a focused way such problems as misuse of coercive measures , extended custody , extortion of confession by torture , arbitrary imposition of fines , and arbitrary collection of fees .  As a result , the law-enforcement work of the public security community has become more regularized and the quality of law enforcement has improved rather significantly .  
The Mormon Church , for instance , boasts of 4.6-million followers .  Evil cults have their own characteristics : authoritative leader , anti-social mode of actions , absolute loyalty to chieftains and to the group one belongs , consciousness of being persecuted , mysterious and secret internal organization , arbitrary self-advertisement , exclusiveness , strict discipline , ideological control and manipulation of fellow believers , compelled service and preaching activities .  
At a meeting to deliberate the " Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty " held at the UN headquarters in New York on 24 April 2000 , on behalf of the international community , UN Secretary General Kofi Annan explicitly voiced his opposition to NMD and his strong misgivings about the enormous destruction the US arbitrary move might bring to the international arms control and nuclear disarmament .  
As a rule , such U.S . official " human rights reports " flagrantly criticize the human rights situations in other countries .  They cite hearsay of one kind or another , but can not present any valid evidence .  Because of this , the reports have been regarded by international public opinion as a combination of " misinformation , exaggerations , groundless accusations , and lopsided and arbitrary conclusions " .  
The correct way to adapt oneself to the new challenges in international security , safeguard world peace , and protect the legitimate security interests of different countries is not to undermine the " ABM Treaty " but to push forward the establishment of a new , just , and rational international political order , abandon power politics and the arbitrary use of force in international affairs , and further strengthen regional and international security .  
In February , 2000 , the French Government 's Interministerial Committee on Opposing Evil Cults published its annual report , explicitly defining for the first time an " evil cult " as : " An organization formed in an arbitrary way , which follows a certain religious goal ( no matter whether or not such a goal is made public ) and carries out activities harmful to human rights or social equilibrium . "  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : Since last year , a number of counties and cities in Anhui Province and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out the trial reform of taxes and charges in rural areas in accordance with the arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council , and have achieved initial good results .  First , the peasants ' burdens have been reduced by a great extent and the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " has been effectively curtailed .  
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
Furthermore , the relevant department has conducted the following special rectification on a large scale : Straightening out electricity charges ; standardizing payments of charges for railroad , traffic , and public security services ; stopping arbitrary ranking , arbitrary evaluations , and arbitrary inspections ; rectifying intermediary service charges ; curbing arbitrary collections of charges from foreign-invested enterprises ; bringing order out of arbitrary collections of charges related to traffic and vehicles ; and reducing town and township enterprises ' burden .  These have all resolved some outstanding problems many enterprises had strong complaints about .  
Contrary to what some have alleged , there has been no unfair targetting of certain demonstrators by the police ; there has been no arbitrary or improper use of the discretion to prosecute ; no heavy penalties have been imposed on demonstrators ; and there is no evidence whatsoever that the current law unfairly restricts the right to peaceful assembly .  
With reference to the mainland 's ill-considered and arbitrary actions , some political commentators put forward the interpretation that with the Communist Party of China 's 16th national congress imminent and a new leadership line-up about to emerge , mainland politicians jostling for positions of power were eager to put on an impressive performance , so they adopted a more hawkish posture .  
In these circumstances , the Russianspeaking population of Latvia is becoming an easy target for radical nationalist bureaucrats performing arbitrary and lawless acts with the secret but , in fact , direct connivance of the political leadership .  
Future work on trade and environment must be aimed at developing an agreed framework for the use of necessary legitimate , transparent and predictable measures for environmental objectives while preventing unilateral and arbitrary green protectionism .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment , summary and arbitrary executions , disappearances , arbitrary detentions , all forms of racism , racial discrimination and apartheid , foreign occupation and alien domination , xenophobia , poverty , hunger and other denials of economic , social and cultural rights , religious intolerance , terrorism , discrimination against women and lack of the rule of law .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
Mindful of the dismay and condemnation expressed by the World Conference on Human Rights , held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 , at the continuing occurrence of gross and systematic violations of human rights , including summary and arbitrary executions ,  
Also requests the Special Rapporteur to continue , in his next report , to pay special attention to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions of children and women and to allegations concerning violations of the right to life in the context of violence against participants in demonstrations and other peaceful public manifestations or against persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities ;  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
Gravely concerned also at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , in particular summary and arbitrary executions , torture , forced labour and forced relocations , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detentions , restrictions on fundamental freedoms , including the freedom of expression and assembly , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deeply concerned by the deterioration of the overall human rights situation in Iraq and the continued massive and grave violations of human rights by the Government of Iraq , such as summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , enforced or involuntary disappearances , arbitrary arrests and detentions , lack of due process and the rule of law , and of freedom of thought , of expression , of association and of access to food and health care ,  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment ;  
While the number of those killed , beaten , detained and sexually assaulted remains unknown , consistent accounts by displaced persons and United Nations personnel lead to a strong presumption that Bosnian Serb soldiers committed substantial violations of international humanitarian law following the fall of Srebrenica , including mass arbitrary detention of civilian men and boys , and summary executions .  
Voluntary repatriation continues to be the preferred durable solution to the refugee problem in the region , but the recurring internal security problems in Rwanda , coupled with arbitrary arrests throughout the country , have emerged as major obstacles preventing refugees from returning .  
Such violations and obstacles include , as well as torture and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment or summary and arbitrary detention , all forms of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia , denial of economic , social and cultural rights and religious intolerance .  
The Government of Iraq noted that , in believing firmly in the right of States to the exercise of complete sovereignty and equality and respect for human rights , it strongly opposes the use by some developed countries of arbitrary economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against the peoples of the world with the aim of humiliating them and depriving them of their basic right to development and economic well-being .  
NULLThe Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 61 ) mentioned that in a number of cases that had come before him in 1994 , it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
NULL CONTINI ( France ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that his delegation deeply regretted the surprising , arbitrary and unjust connection drawn at the previous meeting by the representative of Papua New Guinea between the elimination of racism and nuclear testing . 
For three years , summary and extrajudicial executions , enforced disappearances , arbitrary arrest , rape , torture , and cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment inflicted by agents of the State , threats , extortion , and destruction or confiscation of property were a part of daily life for the people .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious , and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
note of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , in which they describe the situation in Kosovo , the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative , administrative and judicial areas , acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo , including :  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedoms of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial and forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
this regard , we have read with grave concern the latest report of the Secretary-General , further confirming earlier reports that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most , all in the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
concerned at the information contained in the above-mentioned report that there is overwhelming evidence of a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsion , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ,  
Condemns in particular in the strongest possible terms the violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights by Bosnian Serb and paramilitary forces in the areas of Srebrenica , Zepa , Banja Luka and Sanski Most as described in the report of the Secretary-General of 27 November 1995 and showing a consistent pattern of summary executions , rape , mass expulsions , arbitrary detentions , forced labour and large-scale disappearances ;  
selective or double standards in dealing with human rights violations should be avoided ; racist laws and practices , particularly ethnic cleansing and mass deportation , should be resisted regardless of their perpetrators or causes ; all fundamental freedoms should be considered equally important ; arbitrary , undemocratic methods should not be used in international relations on the pretext of defending the rights of the individual , since the will of the international community represented the free will of every State ; and priority should be given to particularly serious human rights violations .  
Our collective reflection clearly revealed that , without the United Nations , the world would only have been more violent , more unstable and insecure , more unjust and cruel especially to the weak , who are prey to power politics and arbitrary decisions .  
The ideal way of achieving this objective is not by applying arbitrary measures in the form of cutbacks , mass dismissals or redeployment , but by applying the guidelines of the General Assembly on personnel issues consistently , while observing and bolstering the principle that the Secretariat must be accountable in a strict and transparent fashion for the execution of the mandates entrusted to it by the Organization 's only universal organ that is , the General Assembly .  
The full realization of human rights , however , remained fragile , as was apparent not only from the tragedies in Rwanda and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but also from the continuing violations in all parts of the world , which took the form of summary executions , arbitrary detention , disappearances and torture and manifestations of new forms of racism and xenophobia in disregard of the fundamental principles of humanitarian law .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .  
Despite greater efforts by judicial officials to respect legal and constitutional guarantees - including procedural time-limits - arbitrary and illegal practices persist , including irregularities in the preparation of arrest warrants , restrictions on the right to defence , prolonged pre-trial detention and some cases of non-respect by prosecutors of decisions handed down by examining judges .  
The High Commissioner raised such matters as : arbitrary and preventive detention ; the treatment of detainees , including cases of custodial rape by members of the police and security forces ; cases of enforced disappearance ; failure to take judicial action against police officers accused of violations of human rights ; the partial application of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to disturbed areas of the country ; social inequalities relating to the caste system ; and policies adopted to eliminate the caste of untouchable .  
The obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and to bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions should be considered of the utmost importance in the context of the protection of the fundamental right to life .  
Moreover , not content with falsely accusing Iraq in the tenth preambular paragraph of summary executions , arbitrary detention and torture , with the sole aim of tarnishing the country 's reputation , the sponsors had neglected to mention the positive developments that had occurred in Iraq , including amnesties granted to prisoners and initiatives to strengthen democracy , pluralism and respect for human rights , such as the right to free speech .  
At the same time , it reveals the current limits of efforts to mainstream the human rights of women , indicating that the vulnerability of women to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary execution , outside the traditional public sphere , has not been encompassed within the mandate of the rapporteur , either at an official level or by the rapporteur personally .  
Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants , notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary , mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians , confiscation and expropriation of their properties , discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers , the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university , as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Expresses its outrage at the instances of massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law as described in the reports of the Special Rapporteur , including ethnic cleansing , killings , disappearances , torture , rape , detentions , beatings , arbitrary searches , destruction of houses , illegal evictions and other acts of violence aimed at forcing individuals from their homes ;  
Strongly urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) to take appropriate measures to respect fully all human rights and fundamental freedoms and to take urgent action to ensure the rule of law in order to prevent arbitrary evictions and dismissals and discrimination against any ethnic or national , religious and linguistic group , including in the fields of education and information ;  
Also gravely concerned , however , at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including killings of civilians , arbitrary arrest and detention , restrictions on freedom of expression and association , torture , forced labour , forced portering , human rights abuses in border areas in the course of military operations , forced relocations and development projects , abuse of women and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , particularly summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Condemns the arbitrary execution , after a flawed judicial process , of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his eight co-defendants , and emphasizes that everyone charged with a penal offence has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law in a public trial with all the guarantees necessary for defence ;  
Indeed , the alternative to the " cumbersome procedure " proposed in the Seventh report is represented either by unilateral and possibly arbitrary action by single , allegedly injured , States or groups thereof , or by merely political decisions by a political body and the action it may authorize .  
It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " .  The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the second half of June 1996 .  
The Mission considers that the deterioration of the conditions in which defendants are held pending trial , and the lengthening of sentences , could have a generalized adverse impact on the protection of individuals against the arbitrary use of State power , while paradoxically failing to achieve the declared aim of protecting the human rights of crime victims .  
Ethnic and religious tensions between Timorese and Indonesians had increased ; mass immigration of Indonesians into the territory of East Timor was continuing ; cases of torture , arbitrary detention , attacks , summary executions , disappearances and killings were becoming increasingly common ; the numbers and violence of the military and police forces were increasing , and many Timorese , especially young people , had become strangers in their own land and had been forced to seek asylum . 
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the first half of July 1996 .  
The human rights situation in Burundi is characterized by large-scale massacres involving both State agents and rebels ; selective murders of intellectuals , political leaders , provincial officials and Hutu merchants , as well as certain Tutsi military officers alleged to be moderates ; arbitrary arrests ; and enforced disappearances .  
Condemn the serious crimes and inhuman atrocities of genocide , massacres , extrajudicial killings , reprisal killings , arbitrary detention , torture , use of rape as an instrument of suppression , burning of houses , villages and townships , and destruction and desecration of holy places , committed by the Indian Government , through its military and paramilitary personnel , renegades and mercenaries , in Jammu and Kashmir during the last seven years ;

It adopted the Declaration 's definition of violence against women as " any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life " . d / The Group agreed that economic exploitation can be a form of violence .  
The Commission on Human Rights , by its resolution 1982 / 29 of 11 March 1982 , recommended that the Economic and Social Council request the Chairman of the Commission to appoint an individual of recognized international standing as special rapporteur to submit a comprehensive report to the Commission at its thirty-ninth session on the occurrence and extent of the practice of summary or arbitrary executions , together with his conclusions and recommendations .  
Urgent transmissions were made by the Special Rapporteur in cases that evinced a fear of imminent extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; these cases included death threats and fear of imminent execution of death sentences in contravention of the limitations on capital punishment set forth in the pertinent international instruments .  
The Special Rapporteur believes that follow-up efforts should focus on how Governments comply with their obligation under international law to conduct full , independent and impartial investigations into all allegations of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions transmitted to them , with a view to clarifying the circumstances , identifying and prosecuting those responsible , granting compensation to the victims or their families and preventing future violations .  
It is the obligation of Governments to carry out exhaustive and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of the right to life , to identify , bring to justice and punish their perpetrators , to grant compensation to the victims or their families , and to take effective measures to avoid future recurrence of such violations .  The Special Rapporteur has noted that impunity continues to be the principal cause of the perpetuation and encouragement of violations of human rights , and , in particular , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
One of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions continues to be persons involved in struggles , such as those to secure rights to land or to prevent or combat racial , ethnic or religious discrimination and ensure respect for social , cultural , economic , civil and political rights . 
Violations of human rights remain extremely serious , including , in particular , the practice of torture , summary and arbitrary executions , forced labour , including forced portering for the military , abuse of women , politically motivated arrests and detention , forced displacement , serious restrictions on the freedoms of expression and association , and the imposition of oppressive measures directed , in particular , at ethnic and religious minority groups ;  
Further , a multitude of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing grossly disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions are arbitrary when measured by international standards .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .  
The Commission continued to alert the international community to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; torture and enforced disappearance ; arbitrary detention ; violence against women , children and vulnerable groups ; the problem of internally displaced persons , extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , etc .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , in his report ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) referred to a number of cases that had come before him in 1995 , in which it was alleged that the victims subjected to death threats or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions belonged to national , ethnic , religious or linguistic minorities .  
The present report is a joint interim report submitted to the General Assembly by Mr . Bacre Waly Ndiaye , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and Mr . Param Cumaraswamy , Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the independence of judges and lawyers , pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 79 of 23 April 1996 , entitled " Situation of human rights in Nigeria " .  2 .  The report is divided into five chapters .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , in his report to the Commission on Human Rights ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 4 ) cited information that had been brought to his attention in 1995 concerning the secret trials held before the Special Military Court in Lagos of more than 30 military officials and civilians accused of being involved in an alleged attempted coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at .  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions remains deeply concerned about the application of the death penalty in Nigeria ; the use of force by law enforcement officials ; the continuing occurrence of communal violence and apparent lack of preventive measures ; and extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , the large number of deaths in detention and the high rate of impunity ;  
As in the preceding months , the mission of observers continues to received numerous allegations of massacres , killings , infringements of personal freedom and security , forced disappearances and arbitrary detentions in the interior of Burundi , especially in the provinces of Muramvya , Gitega , Kayanza , Cibitoke and Bubanza , allegations which are difficult or take a long time to verify because of the aforementioned security constraints . 
Aside from the heavy tribute paid daily in numerous human lives in particular by the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons the refugees who are returning from Zaire by the thousands , fleeing the cataclysm abroad , are faced with tragic conditions in their own country , Burundi , and are being throttled by an embargo which is arbitrary in every way .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all alleged extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
With regard to the interim report on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights ( A / 51 / 457 ) , he noted that the Special Rapporteur , in paragraph 99 of his report , emphasized that Governments must respect the right to life of all persons , even when they demonstrated total disregard for the lives of others .  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo , including , in particular , the discriminatory measures and practices , arbitrary searches and detention , the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and to revoke all discriminatory legislation , in particular that which has entered into force since 1989 ;  
Noting with deep concern reports of grave human rights violations in the Sudan , in particular summary executions , detentions without trial , forced displacement of persons and torture , as described in reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , and the Special Rapporteur on the question of religious intolerance ,  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
The observation of the Special Rapporteur in paragraph 68 that " a great reluctance of the international community to use the term ' genocide ' " is not rooted , as the Special Rapporteur would like it , in the alleged " reluctance " but in the fact that such a position is contrary to international law , while the prevailing practice of certain political bodies and some United Nations Special Rapporteurs to invest genocide with arbitrary definitions has been politically motivated .  
A proposal for a zero or negative increase for the biennium 1998-1999 at the current stage would be arbitrary and unrealistic , and a proposal to set the general level of the contingency fund simply on the basis of the experience of the previous biennium would be of doubtful reliability and validity .  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .  
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 58 on this situation decided to request " the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in Zaire and on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and a member of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to carry out a joint mission to investigate allegations of massacres and other issues affecting human rights which arise from the situation prevailing in eastern Zaire since September 1996 " .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
None of the parties to the conflict has fulfilled the obligations arising from article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , and serious violations of its provisions have occurred , including attempts on life and physical integrity , homicide , torture , taking of hostages , outrages upon personal dignity and arbitrary arrests , including arrests of wounded and sick people , without the justification of military necessity .  
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Further , it should be emphasized that all allegations contained in the interim report had been transmitted to the Government during the course of 1996 by special rapporteurs and working groups of the Commission on Human Rights , including the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , on the question of torture and on the independence of judges and lawyers and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention .  
For three years the daily life of Haitians was marked by murders , summary and extrajudicial executions , enforced disappearances , arbitrary arrests , rape , torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , extortion , and destruction or confiscation of property .  
The growing international concern at such problems as freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention , protection against all forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , circumstances and conditions of detention and imprisonment , and humanization of criminal justice were cornerstones of the protection of human rights .  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Gravely concerned at the continued violations of human rights in Myanmar , as reported by the Special Rapporteur , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , killings of civilians , torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , deaths in custody , absence of due process of law , severe restrictions on freedoms of opinion , expression , assembly and association , violations of freedom of movement , forced relocation , forced labour and portering and the imposition of oppressive measures directed in particular at ethnic and religious minorities ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and West Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , their expulsion from their land , the bombardment of peaceful villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
In an earlier report ( S / 25274 , para . 56 ) , the Commission stated that : " ' Ethnic cleansing ' has been carried out by means of murder , arbitrary arrest and detention , extra-judicial executions , rape and sexual assault , confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas , forcible removal , displacement and deportation of civilian population , deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas , and wanton destruction of property . "  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
Repression by the serbian authorities had involved the killing of ethnic Albanians , the systematic use of torture , arbitrary arrest and detention , mistreatment of political and human rights activists and the suppression of efforts to promote education in the Albanian language .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
Attention is drawn to the definition of violence against women contained in article 1 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women ( General Assembly resolution 48 / 104 ) : [ A ] ny act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm and suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life .  
Without seeking to be exhaustive in the present interim report , the Special Rapporteur would nevertheless like to bring to the attention of the General Assembly a number of allegations of human rights violations transmitted to him during the period under consideration , particularly as regards the right to life and physical integrity , arrests and arbitrary detentions and torture or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment .  
Any person may take quick , expedient action to protect himself , as long as no other more appropriate judicial means exist , against any immediate or potential act or omission of public authorities or any individuals , harming , restricting , altering or threatening rights and guarantees recognized by this Constitution , by a treaty or by a law , in either an arbitrary or a manifestly illegal manner . . . .  
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation has interpreted these provisions as meaning that the basis for the guarantee of equality before the law is the provision of equal treatment to people in reasonably equal circumstances ; this guarantee therefore does not prevent the legislator from giving different consideration to situations he believes to be different , provided that such distinctions are not made using arbitrary criteria leading to undue favour or prejudice , undue personal or class advantages or disadvantages or unlawful persecution .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .  
Although an express prohibition of arbitrary displacement is contained in international humanitarian law ( Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols ) and in the law relating to indigenous peoples , in human rights law , by contrast , the prohibition is only implicit in various provisions , particularly in the rights to freedom of movement , choice of residence and housing , and freedom from arbitrary interference with ones home .  
The allegations of summary , arbitrary and extrajudicial executions reported to him from many parts of the country were not surprising , because Iraqi legislation routinely prescribed the death penalty , even for minor offences , and also because the special security services and important figures in the regime had the power to take peoples lives at will ; the Iraqi Government made no attempt whatsoever to change that state of affairs , which it even justified on the grounds that the situation was difficult and that crime was on the increase .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Participation requires a guarantee of the rule of law and fair judicial procedures in order to reduce the likelihood of decisions that are arbitrary , corrupt and biased , which in turn requires a sound legal environment , including an independent judiciary with adequate resources .  
In this way , we can avoid the arbitrary use of the veto power in matters that are irrelevant to such interests , but affect narrow regional calculations or temporary political gains unrelated to issues of international peace and security .  
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
It also refers to the arbitrary and coercive measures undertaken against the Arab population , such as administrative detention , collective punishment , the demolition of homes , curfews , the forcible transfer of Bedouin population , closures , impeding the free movement of people and , in particular , the restriction that prevents them from travelling through Jerusalem between the north and south of the country .  
In addition to these illegal Israeli settlement activities , numerous reports and documents of the United Nations provide ample description of the systematic inhumane practices of the Zionist regime , including arbitrary mass arrests , detention and shooting of Palestinians , sealing or demolition of homes and internal closure of the territories .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
Although the Special Rapporteur notes that there presently does not appear to exist an explicit or systematic government policy of encouraging summary executions , he is greatly concerned by the frequent allegations of arbitrary killings of civilians and insurgents by members of the Tatmadaw under a variety of circumstances , in violation of the right to life contained in article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
In addition to the Special Rapporteur 's participation in the special rapporteurs ' meeting and in joint urgent actions transmitted to Governments , in 1996 the Special Rapporteur requested to undertake a joint mission to Nigeria with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
That included all violent acts against female victims that resulted in , or could result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , as well as threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivations of liberty , whether occurring in public or private life .  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
Calls upon all parties to the hostilities to respect fully the applicable provisions of international humanitarian law including article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 , to halt the use of weapons , including landmines , against the civilian population and to protect all civilians , especially women , members of minorities and children , from violations of human rights and humanitarian law , including forcible displacement , arbitrary detention , ill _ treatment , torture and summary executions ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with his mandate established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
Decides to consider the question of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions as a matter of priority at its fifty _ fourth session under the item entitled Question of the violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of the world , with particular reference to colonial and other dependent countries and territories .  
Deeply concerned at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , arbitrary or summary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;

The Ministerial Council observed with great concern the continuing deadlock and deterioration of the peace process in the Middle East and the growing danger of its imminent breakdown as a result of the arbitrary policies and provocative practices pursued by the Israeli Government , with its insistence on building a new settlement in Jerusalem , expanding settlements in the occupied Arab territories and reneging on its commitments relating to the implementation of agreements signed with the Palestinian Authority .  
Emphasizes its opposition to all instances of arbitrary deprivation of nationality , especially those based on racial , national , ethnic or religious grounds , as a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms and an impediment to the right to return to one 's country ;  
The systematic and planned killing , deportation , rape , summary execution , abduction , arbitrary detention and looting was perpetrated by the Taliban while Pakistani military personnel accompanied and assisted the Taliban .  
In most of the cases reported to the Working Group , the sources alleged that the individuals are being held incommunicado and they express a fear that the victims may be subjected to torture or extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions .  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
Such an approach , based on arbitrary , biased positions and inaccurate conclusions is not acceptable , nor does it serve for the protection and promotion of human rights , reflecting instead partial political interests .  
His delegation supported the phasing out of gratis personnel and their replacement by international civil servants , and was opposed to any arbitrary financial ceiling that might adversely affect backstopping of peacekeeping operations .  
Destruction of houses , arbitrary indiscriminate killing of innocent civilians and forced relocation of people to unknown sites culminating in what is known as ethnic and tribal cleansing are all deployed as techniques for a show of military might .  
The United Arab Emirates , which considered Israels actions to be unlawful , strongly condemned Israels arbitrary rule and immoral acts : collective punishment , the blockade of towns and villages , the profanation of Muslim sacred objects and places of worship , violence and the arbitrary detention and murder of innocent , peaceful inhabitants , including women and children . 
Strongly condemns summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings , enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , and calls upon the Government of Iraq to provide an accounting for the clean-out of prisons where there is credible evidence of mass summary executions ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial and arbitrary executions , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of expression , assembly , association and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
During their joint visit to Colombia in October 1994 , the Special Rapporteurs on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on torture both drew attention to the need to strengthen the ordinary justice system to make it universally more efficient , so that it would no longer be necessary to resort to special justice systems , such as the system of regional justice ( see report E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 111 ) .  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
The Office 's background investigations of targeted violence further confirmed the observations expressed in my previous report that the nature of violent activity in Kosovo , which has now spread to urban areas , has increased the number of persons who live in fear of being directly affected by violence or arbitrary treatment .  
The primary causes for these types of violation , one source reported , are the wide gap between the letter of the law and practice by the relevant authorities ; legislation and regulations that lead to the arbitrary detention of political opponents ; the absence of procedural safeguards in the law ; the lack of judicial independence ; and the absence of a separation between the military and the police . 
The wide disrespect of the rule of law , including increasing numbers of arbitrary and politically motivated arrests and detentions , detentions without trial , sometimes without the knowledge of the families of detainees , and the abuse of the judicial process , including trial of detainees in secrecy without proper legal representation , and the inhuman treatment of prisoners , leading to illness and deaths in custody , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
Deplores the continued Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied zone in southern Lebanon and west Bekaa , demonstrated in particular by the abduction and arbitrary detention of civilians , the destruction of their dwellings , the confiscation of their property , the expulsion from their land , the bombardment of villages and civilian areas , and other practices violating human rights ;  
Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;

Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
Since the arbitrary termination of the autonomy of Kosovo by the Belgrade authorities in 1989 , we , together with the international community , have watched with great distress the Serbian acts of atrocities against the innocent and hard-working people of Kosovo and the campaigns of ethnic cleansing that have been reminiscent of the preceding sinister acts against the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina that were also committed by the Serbs .  
Refugees who have arrived in neighbouring countries have given consistent accounts of civilians being subjected to systematic and extreme human rights violations by security forces , of executions , of forced eviction from their homes , deportations , arbitrary detention , acts of sexual violence and burning of homes .  
In response to reports of summary executions of non-combatants , including women and children , in their homes , arbitrary detentions , forced displacement , use of forced labour and burning of homes and property in the central highlands of Hazarajat , the Special Rapporteur visited Quetta , Pakistan , on 22 May where he met refugees who provided credible eye-witness accounts of gross violations of human rights during March , April and May 1999 . 
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
They expressed serious concern with regard to grave breaches , breaches and violations by Israel , the occupying Power , of the Fourth Geneva Convention , including arbitrary detention , ill-treatment of and violence against the civilian population , torture , summary execution , confiscation , and destruction of property , forcible transfers and deportations , and the various forms of collective punishment , as well as the destruction of economic and social structures of the Occupied Territory .  
At its twenty-fifth session , the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers also rejected any arbitrary or unilateral measures , whether political or legal , applied by one country against another one and urged all States to consider this law , which is against the international law and norms , as null and void ( A / 53 / 95-S / 1998 / 311 , para .  69 ) .  
Rather than relying on artificial and arbitrary time-frames unrelated to need or performance , the expression of special and differential treatment should be linked to specific economic and social criteria .  
The Appellate Body concluded that the United States measure was falling within the exception covered by subparagraph ( g ) of article XX , but went on to state that any recourse to an exception had to satisfy the requirements of article XX in that it should not be applied in a manner constituting an arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or be a disguised restriction on international trade .  
For some , the central piece in the struggle is the reform of the legal system , that is to say , the search for a system that is less arbitrary , less driven by ideology , less cruel towards its dissidents and criminals ; in short a system based on the rule of law built around respect for the personal dignity of all individuals .  
All international disputes and regional conflicts should be resolved in a fair and reasonable manner through peaceful negotiation and consultation on the basis of equality , rather than through the arbitrary use or threat of force based on the power of military superiority .  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Warfare in the central highlands in April and May involved vicious attacks against civilians , including the summary execution of women and children , forced and involuntary displacement , the looting and burning of homes , arbitrary detention and the use of forced labour . 
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
The concept of non _ discrimination on the basis of national origin should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
The Lebanese Government strongly condemns Israel 's arbitrary actions against the Lebanese civilian population , and it requests you to do your utmost to induce the Israeli authorities concerned to halt these inhuman and unlawful practices and , at last , to close down the Khiyam centre that they maintain inside Lebanese territory .  
Noting with concern the resulting exacerbation of the enormous suffering of the Afghan people , resulting in the massive loss of human life , summary executions , the deliberate abuse and arbitrary detention of civilians , refugee flows , the use of child soldiers , harassment , the forcible displacement of innocent civilians and extensive destruction ,  
For this reason , countries with a well established tradition of private participation in infrastructure projects have developed a series of control mechanisms and remedies to protect government contractors against arbitrary or improper acts by public authorities , such as access to impartial dispute settlement bodies and full compensation schemes for governmental wrongdoing .  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued , so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention , and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example , in the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , Ms . A . Jahangir , in her report to the Commission at its fifty-fifth session ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 ) stated that the execution of a death sentence passed after a trial in which basic fair trial standards , as provided for in article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , were not respected , constituted a violation of the right to life .  
The Special Rapporteur , in an addendum to her report , on country situations ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 / Add . 1 ) , stated that she had received numerous allegations concerning extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions committed by armed insurgent groups in Sierra Leone .  
Through such interim decisions , the treaty bodies ( as well as some of the Commissions special procedures mechanisms such as the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ) have obtained temporary or permanent relief for countless potential victims in cases concerning , for example , stays of imminent execution , commutation of death sentences , or deferrals of extradition , expulsion or deportation orders .  
The excesses of the so-called military justice , a regular cause of arbitrary detention and impunity for human rights violations , as demonstrated by cases brought before the Working Group , have prompted the Group , in its recommendations in previous reports , to underline the need for an international conference to analyse the subject and seek to limit the actual powers of the military justice system ;  
The Working Group was concerned at the continuing abusive treatment of women , including custodial deaths , torture , rape , abduction , disappearances , arbitrary arrests , forced abortions and sterilizations , harassment and arson by security forces , including military and police forces , or by other governmental authorities , particularly where separatist movements were reported .  
The Working Group was concerned at the allegations of the violations of the human rights of women , including widespread arbitrary arrest , use of excessive force during arrests , incommunicado detention , prolonged administrative detention , detention of minors , torture and ill-treatment , unfair trial and forcible exile of political opponents and prisoners .  
The adoption of a rigid classification of economic , social and cultural rights which puts them , by definition , beyond the reach of the courts would thus be arbitrary and incompatible with the principle that the two sets of human rights are indivisible and interdependent .  
That violence is particularly evident during raids in which large numbers of more or less arbitrary and often violent arrests are made , often on the basis of being the wrong sort 8 ] , and the burden of proof of legal status rests with the accused : many foreigners , even South Africans , have spent months in prison like this , as their status can sometimes be difficult to determine . 
In his concluding remarks and recommendations , the Special Rapporteur noted that one of the most prevalent targets of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to be persons preventing and combating racial , ethnic or religious discrimination , and persons belonging to minorities .  
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights observed that the transformation of the nature of violence in Kosovo had reduced the geographic area of perceived safety and had resulted in a real increase in the number of persons who live in apprehension of direct experience of violence or arbitrary treatment .  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
Summary and arbitrary executions , including political killings and the continued so-called clean-out of prisons , as well as enforced or involuntary disappearances , routinely practised arbitrary arrests and detention and consistent and routine failure to respect due process and the rule of law , for example the execution of delinquents for minor property offences and customs violations ;  
Deplores the continuing violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , including the use of children , forced relocation , and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ;  
The human rights violations reported to him by credible eyewitnesses had included forced displacement of the civilian population , deliberate burning of houses , summary execution of noncombatants , arbitrary detention and forced labour .  
With respect to cases of honour killing considered by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expressed his concern in regard to these instances of summary execution and urged the Governments concerned to bring those responsible to justice .  
There continues to be no sustained rule of law in Equatorial Guinea ; rather , power is concentrated in the hands of the executive , which leads to continued arbitrary detention and torture designed to prevent actual or suspected coup dtat attempts , or in any case to prevent political parties or ethnic groups opposing the governing group from gaining power .  
On the contrary , arbitrary detentions continued to occur throughout the year , by order of higher authority , which means that imprisonment is decided by the executive power , subject to no control whatsoever by the judicial authorities .  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Deeply concerned at continued reports of widespread violence against civilians and on alleged violations of human rights and humanitarian law , in particular forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , torture , arbitrary detentions , ad hoc detention locations and continued abuses and harassment at checkpoints by Russian State agents in the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation ,  
Strongly condemns the continued use of disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Russian military forces , federal servicemen and State agents , including attacks against civilians and other breaches of international law as well as serious violations of human rights , such as forced disappearances , extrajudicial , summary and arbitrary executions , torture and other inhuman and degrading treatment , and calls upon the Government of the Russian Federation to comply with its international human rights and humanitarian law obligations in its operations against Chechen fighters and to take all measures to protect the civilian population ;  
Reiterates its requests that the relevant special rapporteurs and the special mechanisms of the Commission undertake missions to the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation without delay and expresses serious concern that the thematic special rapporteurs or representatives on the question of torture , on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on internally displaced persons , who have requested to undertake visits have not yet received an answer and urges the Government of the Russian Federation to give favourable consideration to their requests as a matter of priority ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 55 / 111 of 4 December 2000 , in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty-seventh session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
Reiterates the obligation of all Governments to conduct exhaustive and impartial investigations into all suspected cases of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , to identify and bring to justice those responsible , while ensuring the right of every person to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law , to grant adequate compensation to the victims or their families and to adopt all necessary measures , including legal and judicial measures in order to bring an end to impunity , to prevent the recurrence of such executions ;  
Further requests the Secretary-General to continue , in close collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , in conformity with the mandate of the High Commissioner established by the General Assembly in its resolution 48 / 141 of 20 December 1993 , to ensure that personnel specialized in human rights and humanitarian law issues form part of United Nations missions , where appropriate , in order to deal with serious human rights violations , such as extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
Invites States to take legislative , administrative , legal and other steps , including when a state of emergency has been declared , to take action at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations , if appropriate through technical assistance , and to provide the Working Group with concrete information on the measures taken and the obstacles encountered in preventing enforced , involuntary or arbitrary disappearances and in giving effect to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance ;  
Gravely concerned at the deterioration of the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories and by the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , in particular extrajudicial killings , closures , collective punishments , settlements and arbitrary detentions ,  
Affirms that the term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in , or is likely to result in , physical , sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women , including threats of such acts , coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty , whether occurring in public or in private life , and including domestic violence , crimes committed in the name of honour , crimes committed in the name of passion , traditional practices harmful to women , including female genital mutilation , and forced marriages ;  
Alarmed by the reality of daily violations of childrens rights , including the right to life , to physical security and to freedom from arbitrary detention , torture and any form of exploitation , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , as laid out in relevant international instruments ,  
In accordance with the now general practice of using the term discrimination exclusively to designate arbitrary distinctions , the term positive discrimination is a contradictio in terminis : either the distinction in question is justified and legitimate , because not arbitrary , and can not be called discrimination , or the distinction in question is unjustified or illegitimate , because arbitrary , and should not be labelled positive .  
It also argues , in paragraph 10 of its General Comment No . 9 , that to put economic , social and cultural rights beyond the reach of courts is arbitrary and incompatible with the international principle that those rights are indivisible and interdependent with civil and political rights .  
The General Assembly reaffirmed the responsibility of Governments to safeguard and protect the rights of migrants against illegal or violent acts , in particular acts of racial discrimination and crimes perpetrated with racist or xenophobic motivation by individuals or groups , and urged them to reinforce measures in that regard ; urged all States to adopt effective measures to put an end to the arbitrary arrest and detention of migrants , including by individuals or groups ; and called upon all States to protect the human rights of migrant children , in particular unaccompanied migrant children .  
The General Assemblys political decision on the level of the regular budget was often arbitrary and sometimes appeared to be motivated by budgetary and economic trends in national Governments or by what Member States contributed to other United Nations operations or entities .  
Concerning the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , of the 167 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 63 were based on information communicated by local or regional non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , 78 on information provided by international NGOs in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council , and 26 by private sources .  
At the systematic policy of the Government of Myanmar of persecuting the democratic opposition , National League for Democracy members and their families , as well as ethnic opposition parties , and at the use by the Government of intimidatory methods such as arbitrary arrest and detention , abuse of the legal system , including harsh long-term prison sentences , which has forced many to refrain from exercising their legitimate political rights ;  
The deterioration of the human rights situation and the continuing pattern of gross and systematic violations of human rights in Myanmar , including extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , enforced disappearances , rape , torture , inhuman treatment , mass arrests , forced labour , forced relocation and denial of freedom of assembly , association , expression and movement ;
