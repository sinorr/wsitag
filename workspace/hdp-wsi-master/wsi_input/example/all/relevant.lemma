Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
Fourth , along with the development of agricultural productive forces , the social division of labor is increasingly elaborate , the degree of commercialization , specialization , and socialization of agricultural production is unceasingly enhanced , and the combination and interdependence of agriculture with relevant industrial departments is closer and closer with each passing day , which have led to the integration of supply , production , and marketing , and of agriculture , industry , and commerce in agricultural operation .

The commission collected irregular business records of various fund management corporations and technically and quantitatively analyzed in a unified manner how these corporations used fund assets for securities exchange .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
This spokesman indicated : According to different actual conditions of persons concerned and in line with relevant regulations stipulated in the " Procedures for Management of Qualifications of Fund Managers " , the commission has decided to suspend the employment qualifications of the fund workers and senior fund managers who should assume direct responsibility for this corporation 's irregular activities , so as to ensure the safety of fund assets and the normal operation of fund business .

Corporations were required to check relevant facts if any problems are discovered and to designate persons to be responsible for correcting problems in restructuring , investment concepts , internal control , workers ' professional performances , and disciplinary procedures .  
In order to provide market access opportunities for the undertaking of developing institutional investors on an usual scale and on the basis of strict self-discipline , the China Securities Regulatory Commission will adopt a series of measures including introduction of open-end fund , making preparations for and give approval to establishment of new fund companies , paying attention to relevant preparation work in terms of establishment of fund management companies of Chinese-foreign joint ventures , and conducting studies on proposals of innovation of various funding products which have been transformed from closed-end to open-end .

After receiving the application from the leader of a topic group , a military scientific research management department of an individual unit may make a plan for appraising , testing , or accepting the relevant research results before sending personnel to do the work and shall submit in a timely fashion a report to a military scientific research management department at a higher level after deeming a research topic suitable for listing in a military scientific research plan for a unit at a higher level .  
They should also be introduced if they meet relevant requirements .  In short , capable personnel are the basic conditions for doing any work .  As long as the recruitment of such capable personnel is conducive to the building of national defense and to the modernization of our armed forces , we should strive to recruit them without sticking to one pattern .

After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Obviously , the whole plane collision incident took place in China 's exclusive economic zone .  The US side smashed the airplane of the Chinese side , and illegally entered Chinese territory .  As the victim country , the country where the incident took place , and the country where the aircraft that caused the incident landed , the Chinese side enjoys jurisdiction over the whole incident , including rights to conduct investigations on the incident , according to relevant international laws and regulations and Chinese laws .  
Instead of giving sincere and friendly remarks , the United States couched in harsh terms and stressed with an intransigent attitude that the plane was US property and territory .  Moreover , it demanded the Chinese Government return the crew and the surveillance plane as quickly as possible .  This is absolutely a hegemonic act which is not only not in conformity with the relevant provisions outlined in international law but is also the logic of a bandit , without any reasons .  
During the meeting , relevant consular officials of the Chinese Foreign Ministry pointed out to the US Embassy and Consulate officials mentioned above that after the US military reconnaissance plane bumped against and destroyed a Chinese military plane in the airspace over the coastal waters of China , it , without the permission of the Chinese side , intruded into China 's territorial airspace and landed on an airport in China . This has violated relevant provisions of the international law and relevant Chinese laws .  China has the right to investigate the entire incident .  
and have a full range of technical means for law-enforcement .  Sixth , we must revise and perfect relevant laws and regulations , build a stronger law-enforcement contingent , and improve the level of law-enforcement .  A task of top priority is to conscientiously tackle the outstanding problem that the law is neither fully observed nor enforced .

Speaking at a business seminar in Kanazawa City of Ishikawa Prefecture , Mr Leung stressed that seeking an interpretation was not an attempt to overrule or reinterpret the CFA 's judgement , which the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government ( HKSARG ) respected .

Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways . This situation was compounded by the shortage of skilled personnel at the grass-roots level , making implementation of policy even more difficult .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
This is the background against which the expansive and ambitious literary style of the Han took shape . Writers wrote with the elegance of a Chu poem and the sophistry of a diplomat . In tackling a subject , they endeavored to integrate virtually every possibility and use every relevant term . Their writing reflected the grandiose Zeitgeist of the Han Empire , and became the major form of Han literature .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing .

And I 've never wavered from working to accomplish this . "  
For the September edition of Sinorama , your magazine interviewed me on issues related to the protection of human rights for people of diverse sexual orientations ( including homosexuals , bisexuals and transgender people ) . Perhaps for reasons of space , many controversial points were not covered in detail , so I am now writing to give a little further explanation and to again call on people of vision to press the relevant authorities to quickly draft laws to concretely protect the basic human rights of transgender people .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications .

They pointed out that the responsibility of the United Nations in this matter should continue until the Palestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination , until an independent and sovereign State is established within its national territory and until the problem of refugees is settled in conformity with human rights instruments and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations .  
We also reaffirm the importance of a continued role by the United Nations and its specialized agencies in the peace process and call upon Israel to honour its commitments under relevant resolutions of international legality in the interests of a better future of peace , tolerance , human development and economic and social development in the region .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
Owing to insufficient consultations and negotiations at the Conference , reasonable views and opinions of some States that have major interests in marine fisheries failed to be duly reflected in relevant provisions .  The actual implementation of these Articles may encounter many difficulties and may increase the differences and disputes between States with conflicting interests .  
Therefore , in that regard , my delegation urges all administering Powers to work closely with the Committee , given the fact that the current membership wishes to ensure that the Committee 's work is progressive , innovative and responsive to the realities of the new international order in relation to special social , economic and political conditions pertaining to the Territories under consideration , and that we do so within the mandate of the Charter and the relevant General Assembly resolutions .

Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,  
In the Republic of Croatia , the Zagreb-based field staff through its numerous contacts with non-governmental organizations , its participation in relevant conferences and its exceptional access to top government officials , provided the Special Rapporteur with vital information , enabling him to make timely observations on the changing human rights situation .  
Review the impact of structural adjustment programmes on social development , including , where appropriate , by means of gender sensitive social impact assessments and other relevant methods , in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and improve their positive impact ; the cooperation of international financial institutions in the review could be requested by interested countries ;

Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
Although the status quo in Angola is a cause for optimism that peace will be restored to that country , it is vital that the two parties continue to demonstrate the political will and the commitment necessary for the achievement of peace and national reconciliation through strict and timely compliance with the Acordos de Paz , the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions , in the interests of durable peace , security and economic and social development in their country .

Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
In order to combat effectively the increase in , and the growing international character and effects of , acts of terrorism , States should enhance their cooperation in this area through , in particular , systematizing the exchange of information concerning the prevention and combating of terrorism , as well as by effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral , regional and multilateral basis ;  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Reiterates the importance of ensuring access , for all persons seeking international protection , to fair and efficient procedures for the determination of refugee status or , as appropriate , to other mechanisms to ensure that persons in need of international protection are identified and granted such protection , while not diminishing the protection afforded to refugees under the terms of the 1951 Convention , the 1967 Protocol and relevant regional instruments ;

National plans and investment in science should further global environment and developmental observing systems and should strengthen internationally coordinated scientific programmes on environment and development involving relevant United Nations bodies and major international scientific bodies .  
The information on which decisions and actions are based is sometimes too sectoral to be relevant to complex real-world problems , out of date , partial to a particular geographical or cultural perspective , or driven by emotional reactions or interpretations .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Also believe that the current mandate leaves substantial room for a more assertive and effective mission by UNPROFOR and relevant regional organizations , especially bearing in mind Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , although there could be potential enhancement of the existing Security Council mandate of UNPROFOR ;  
Environmental monitoring data and other relevant information , including consumer information , which are currently lacking in many developing countries , need to be developed urgently so as to provide a sound information base for policy formulation and decision-making on changing the current unsustainable production and consumption patterns .  
The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression , although the Security Council may , in conformity with the Charter , conclude that a determination that an act of aggression has been committed would not be justified in the light of other relevant circumstances , including the fact that the acts concerned or their consequences are not of sufficient gravity .  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .  
In addition , the United Nations system , in coordination with other relevant organizations , is asked by Agenda 21 to provide recommendations for harmonizing the development of indicators at the national , regional and global levels , and for incorporating a suitable set of these indicators in common , regularly updated , and widely accessible reports and databases , for use at the international level , subject to national sovereignty considerations ( para . 
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
For clusters of indicators , various organizations will have the task of assuming a leading role in a transparent consultative process for the purpose of further developing the indicators , as relevant , including the underlying methodology , and of analysing the data availability for each indicator in order to provide a full description of each indicator in a set of methodology sheets .  
More important , there is a widespread belief among politicians and senior government officials that the adoption of sound environmental practices would result in lower rates of economic growth in the short run , that pollution control would divert scarce resources from more relevant social areas and that it would lead to price increases .  
They note that an informal round table that includes representatives of all agencies , as well as members of the academic community and relevant non-governmental organizations , is useful for the purposes of developing innovative ideas and concepts relating to how development communication should be understood , as far as this concept has not yet been defined according to one universal standard .

The Working Group recognized that the Convention on Biological Diversity , which has now entered into force , will be the principal mechanism for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and provides an excellent basis for coordinating relevant instruments .  
During the work on the new arrangement and the present draft resolution , which will be adopted today , one Member State , regrettably , expressed low tolerance for the legitimate interests of Croatia , a Member State , and instead directed efforts into forms of short-term political pragmatism , at the expense of legal and operative logic of the relevant United Nations documents .  
A review and recent evaluation of the experience of past capacities and needs matching exercises sponsored by the Special Unit for TCDC suggests the need to ensure that these exercises are an adequately prepared , demand-driven process where needs and capacities identified are realistic in terms of their potential application and relevant to key development objectives of recipient countries , and that adequate funding has been arranged to carry out the resulting agreements .  
By resolution 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , the General Assembly decided that the governing body of the United Nations Children 's Fund should be transformed into an Executive Board and that the Executive Board should have 36 members , to be elected with due regard to equitable geographical representation and other relevant factors , with a view to ensuring the most effective and broadest representation .

Subsequently , the annual overview report of ACC for 1993 stated that , although emergency operations and special assistance projects on behalf of the 21 affected countries had been largely completed , ongoing activities of the relevant components of the United Nations system , within their competence and available resources , continued to take into account the special economic problems of the affected countries ( E / 1994 / 19 , para .  60 ) .  
The objective of the subprogramme is to contribute to the formulation of national and international policy and decision-making by fostering the availability and use of relevant , comprehensive , timely , reliable and comparable international statistics .

The Commission noted that participation in the pilot phase is voluntary and that activities implemented jointly should be compatible with and supportive of national environment and development priorities and strategies , contribute to cost-effectiveness in achieving global benefits and be conducted in a comprehensive manner covering all relevant sources , sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases .  
As the focal point in the United Nations system for monitoring the implementation of the Programme of Action at the global level , UNCTAD coordinates and programmes its work with regional commissions and other relevant organizations within and outside the United Nations system and draws upon the substantial research and analytical capacity existing in the system on the social and economic situation of the least developed countries .  
A coherent national policy would enhance the managerial capability on economic and technical cooperation among developing countries within government and could enable developing countries to take maximum advantage of their participation in cooperation activities and speed up the implementation of relevant decisions and programmes .  
Moreover , in order to exercise its role in providing policy guidance in operational activities , the Council may wish in the future to request the executive boards of the funds and programmes to address the relevant issues arising from the triennial comprehensive policy reviews on the basis of a common report prepared by the concerned organizations ( see para . 17 below ) .  
The representative of ECLAC stated that at present , INSTRAW was experiencing a turning point , therefore its cooperation with the regional commissions required some analysis so that INSTRAW could significantly contribute to the regional work that was taking place ; by the same token , the regional commissions could provide support to INSTRAW 's activities , based on their knowledge of their specific regional conditions , and the regional institutions dealing with the relevant subjects .

The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;

that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to make available additional human and financial resources to enhance the capability of the High Commissioner and of the Centre to fulfil effectively their respective mandates and their ability to carry out mandated operational activities and to coordinate efficiently with other relevant parts of the United Nations system on logistical and administrative questions , having due regard to the need to finance and implement activities of the United Nations related to development ;  
additional relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
Supreme Council discussed Iraq 's implementation of Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression against Kuwait and expressed its deep concern that the Iraqi Government was continuing to fail to implement in full some fundamental aspects of its international obligations under those resolutions and its dubious conduct with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , which constituted a violation of the terms of the cease-fire laid down in resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Just as Israel has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and free from threats or acts of force , as affirmed by Security Council resolution 242 ( 1967 ) , the territorial integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries should also be strictly respected , in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , including resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .

It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of illicit arms trafficking .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1995 and the results of its operations for the year then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority .  
We therefore stress the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement leading to restoration of the Palestinians ' legitimate rights , particularly the rights to self-determination and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles underlying the Madrid Conference .  
This commitment must be proven by the actual , unconditional implementation of all relevant agreements thus far concluded , to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights , including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State , with Jerusalem as its capital .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .

It is also increasingly recognized by disaster-prone country authorities and by many donors that a larger proportion of international assistance should be focused on addressing the root causes of disaster , through suitably adapted prevention and preparedness programmes which maximize the mobilization of national and especially local community resources , drawing upon the skills and expertise of all relevant regional and international agencies .  
Over the past year , the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , in close coordination with other United Nations bodies , has provided assistance to help countries to properly assess their full spectrum of risks , to prescribe , on the basis of global experience , the most cost-effective disaster reduction measures , to coordinate external guidance where needed on how to apply those measures in the most vulnerable areas , and to stimulate wider involvement and closer cooperation among the numerous international agencies with relevant technical and managerial expertise .

Alleviation of the external debt burden would thus help to eliminate widespread poverty among the Nicaraguan population .

The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
To achieve an overview of the relevance of existing international legal instruments to the conservation , management and sustainable use of all types of forests and their relation to issues on the global forest agenda , the present report provides a comprehensive summary of multilateral instruments that are relevant to forest use and conservation .

The relevant commitment , commitment 2 , reads , as adopted : We commit ourselves to the goal of eradicating poverty in the world , through decisive national actions and international cooperation , as an ethical , social , political and economic imperative of humankind .  
It was said that the forum should have a broad mandate and that it should extend beyond a narrow human rights focus to include issues such as economic , social , cultural , political , civil , educational and developmental issues as well as play a role in the coordination of all relevant United Nations activities .

Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .

In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
I am firmly convinced that the opening of a genuine political dialogue between the State Law and Order Restoration Council and the leaders of the political party that won a clear majority in the 1990 elections and of other relevant political forces , including the national races and ethnic groups , is essential to achieve the Government 's stated objectives of democratization and national reconciliation and to assuage the concerns that have been repeatedly expressed in the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights about Myanmar .

It has been recognized in all international legal and political forums that East Jerusalem is an organic part of the West Bank occupied since 1967 and that the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , applies there , as do the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
For all those reasons , and with a view to preserving the religious , cultural and historical character of Jerusalem , the Government of Jordan continues to maintain , restore and protect the Holy Places , now under the yoke of occupation , and to provide the necessary support for the relevant officials , with a view to protecting those places from all dangers pending the final solution to which we look forward .  
It is relevant here to highlight the need for the international community to continue its cooperation with the Central American countries by providing the required economic , financial and technical assistance in sustained fashion and on favourable terms in order to make the goals of the programme of sustainable development in Central America achievable .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
Any dialogue on fresh water should be based first and foremost on the acceptance and recognition of the relevant universally recognized principles of international law , in particular the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization of water resources .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
In addition , during its session , the Governing Council considered reports submitted by a number of Governments on the distribution of compensation awarded to successful claimants in category B . The Council agreed that further discussion was needed regarding the situation where , following the transfer of funds to the relevant Governments or international organizations , awarded compensation has not been distributed to individual claimants , for one reason or another , after a reasonable period of time has elapsed . 
If , after the period for notification of the parties has elapsed , the court feels that it needs additional information in order to reach a decision , it shall convene an immediate oral hearing with the sole participation of the parties , at which it shall receive relevant evidence , hear statements by the parties or their lawyers and , immediately thereafter , issue a reasoned order declaring the extinction valid or invalid and , where appropriate , dismissing the proceedings .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
Data must be adequate , relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which they are held ; be accurate and for the registered purpose ; and surrounded by proper security .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
We further call upon the international community and all its relevant institutions to meet their responsibility to halt these violations forthwith , to ensure the necessary protection for all missing persons , detainees and prisoners and to put an end to practices involving violence and threat of violence that have the basic purpose of spreading terror among the innocent civilian inhabitants of the area and uprooting them .  
We need to pursue these relevant Utopias and I believe the programme proposed by the 28 countries should be considered in the light of the present international context , but also within the expanding horizon of an international disarmament agenda which is intended to have a decisive impact on the status quo and advance even further the swing of the pendulum in the global security system . 
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
The Assembly also appealed to Governments to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
According to the relevant regulations , the Office shall be an autonomous constitutional body with legal capacity in public law and shall be responsible for protecting the constitutional and fundamental rights of individuals and the community and overseeing compliance by public authorities with their duties and the proper provision of public services to the citizenry .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to cooperate fully and in good faith in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
Its strategy was based on a number of measures , which were summarized as legislative provisions in the areas of proceeds of crime , improvement of law enforcement capabilities , relying on the assistance and expertise of other countries that had already experienced organized crime problems and had developed methods to prevent and control it , better coordination among the relevant national authorities and improved international cooperation .  
Particularly relevant was the legislation enacted to control money-laundering and criminal assets in general , which included a broad number of criminal activities whose revenues were to be disguised through money-laundering schemes , the reversal of the onus probandi as to the source of the assets for those who were sentenced for one of the crimes covered by the law and the obligation for financial institutions to report any suspect transaction to the competent authorities .  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
The Assembly , in the same section of that resolution , stressed that the special session should " be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation . . . , and within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 [ 1 ] and other relevant conventions and international instruments " . 
In parallel , measures might be designed to ensure that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , attaches priority to coordinating sustainable development cooperation programmes and investments that directly or indirectly support alternative development initiatives , and that Member States act in a coordinated manner in the governing bodies of all relevant parts of the system .  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , 1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;

The working group initially identified the principles that might be the relevant and maybe subject of future discussion , with a view to establishing a clear linkage between these principles and structural adjustment programmes as they impinged on economic , social and cultural rights .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
Intergovernmental dialogue on sustainable development could usefully be reorganized to consider a limited number of strategic priority issues , so as to develop a more focused approach to relevant activities in the United Nations system both at the international and at the regional and country levels .  
That framework was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in the mandates of the Administrative Committee on Coordination and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining its multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at the universal and effective respect of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;

Reiterates that the damaging exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests , in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations , is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories ;  
It is against this background that my country participated in the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) conference held in South Africa from 19 to 21 May 1997 , in which African countries agreed to develop inter _ African cooperation in mine clearance and victim assistance , and to encourage member States to become parties to relevant international instruments governing anti _ personnel landmines , in addition to supporting and promoting efforts to achieve a global ban .  
Without educational content relevant to current needs , without preparation in the learning skills and new knowledge required for the future , and without efforts to improve learning achievement , access may neither serve the purposes intended nor provide the benefits expected .  Fortunately , serious reflection , more rigorous planning and a spirit of innovation have prepared the ground in many countries for important educational advances in the years ahead .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector .

Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
Likewise , the categorized list contains certain items the export of which to Iraq must be notified to the joint unit established by Security Council resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) as these items will be subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian or for prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant resolutions .

The High Contracting Parties , while independently deciding on matters of national security and military organizational development , shall engage in close cooperation in these areas and determine forms of interaction on the basis of this Treaty , the bilateral Treaty of 16 March 1995 on the Russian military base in the territory of the Republic of Armenia , and other relevant agreements .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
In a separate and dissenting opinion concerning the applicability of article 2 of the statute and the grave breaches regime , the Presiding Judge concluded that at all times relevant to the indictment , the armed conflict in the op \ x { eaa1 } ina of Prijedor was international in character , that the victims were protected persons and that article 2 was applicable .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national and international programmes and projects for the Year and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .

Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
The General Assembly also invited the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , those proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
Several primary needs should be met : to devise effective and coherent arrangements for information and assessment of the impact of sanctions on third States ; to ensure appropriate access by third States to the process ; to develop a method of assessing actual adverse impact ; to explore practical and innovative measures of assistance ; and to enhance coordination and cooperation among relevant institutions and organizations both within and outside the United Nations system .  
The Assembly appealed to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
The aims of the training course were to familiarize participants with the international and regional systems of protection of human rights and procedures to be followed for the preparation of relevant reports , and to provide participants with the requested training tools in order to guarantee an element of continuity through the replication of training at the national level for relevant governmental departments .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
In this connection , we express our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for his initiative , in cooperation and coordination with the relevant international organizations , to assist the least developed countries to formulate integrated country programmes for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services , pursuant to the relevant decision of the Trade and Development Board at its annual session last year .  
The Special Representative seeks to influence relevant actors within the international community , governmental or non-governmental , to support developments in Cambodia that would promote civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .

The Secretary-General proposed to convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
The States members of the European Union had given ample proof of their determination to minimize the detrimental effects suffered by third States , not only through their support of the measures stipulated in the relevant resolutions , but also through substantial economic and humanitarian assistance , especially to those countries which had experienced the adverse effects of the measures taken against the former Yugoslavia .  
His delegation also endorsed the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of the report that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Gravely concerned that , despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Stresses that the special session should be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Requests all concerned organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the regional commissions and other relevant international and multilateral institutions , to make , within their respective fields of competence , substantive contributions and proposals for further action as submissions to the preparatory process of the Conference ;

Similarly , any person entering the country had to declare cash in excess of $ 10,000 , and any lawyer or legal firm acting as the resident agent of a Panamanian company must know the client and keep sufficient information to identify him or it to the relevant authorities when required . 
In introducing the draft resolution , I find it of significance to state that my delegation , while fully aware of the common desire of all concerned to preserve the consensual dimension of this draft resolution , found it essential to reflect the relevant and non-controversial regional realities of which all parties directly concerned are fully conscious and aware .  
Given that the relevant international legal instruments have been put into effect , or are close to being put into effect , the Chinese delegation believes that the existing discriminatory and exclusive mechanisms and arrangements for non-proliferation not only run counter to those international agreements , but inhibit the social and economic development of various countries , especially developing countries .  They should therefore be rescinded ,  
Urges the international community , the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to give priority to supporting the efforts of developing countries to ensure the full and effective participation of women in deciding and implementing development strategies , through , inter alia , women 's increased access to health care , capital , education , training and technology , and wider participation in decision-making ;  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .  
Another delegation , speaking on behalf of a large group , suggested that the Task Force consider that the role of United Nations information centres should be more focused on the issues relevant to individual countries , that they should have sufficient resources to carry out their main tasks , and that they should be integrated where appropriate and beneficial .

Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,

Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and which contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;  
Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;

In order to raise awareness of the economic , social and cultural rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the Department carries on a multi _ media approach to ensure the effective coverage of this issue as well as worldwide distribution of relevant public information materials on human rights .  
While it is relatively common that States envisage in their legislation universal jurisdiction in respect of certain gross violations of human rights , even if such jurisdiction is not expressly required by relevant international instruments , it should be noted that in respect of the rules of international humanitarian law the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and Additional Protocol I of 1977 provide for universal jurisdiction over grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions and the Protocol .

The Committee expressed the hope that States Members of the United Nations , the specialized agencies and national institutions would continue to assist in this work , especially by providing relevant information on the subjects of interest for the future programme of study , so that its deliberations could be based on the broadest and most up-to-date scientific and technical information .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;

In order to lay the foundations of this program and set it in motion , we should consider holding an international meeting with the participation of the relevant agencies of the system , regional organs and the respective national programmes of the countries concerned .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .

We hope that the OSCE mission in Bosnia will continue to work in close contact with relevant United Nations structures and specialized agencies in resolving such vital matters as protection of the rights of ethnic minorities , the problems of refugees , and the normal functioning of municipal authorities .  
This reservation is based on the decision of the Council of Arab Foreign Ministers to suspend Arab participation in the multilateral committees until tangible progress is achieved in the peace process , particularly on the bilateral tracks , and until the Israeli Government has fulfilled its commitment to implement the signed agreements and obligations already subscribed to in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions and other resolutions .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .

Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
At its fiftieth session , the Commission adopted resolution 1994 / 45 , entitled The question of integrating the rights of women into the human rights mechanism of the United Nations and the elimination of violence against women , in which inter alia , it called for intensified effort at the international level to integrate the equal status of women and the human rights of women into the mainstream of United Nations system _ wide activity and to address these issues regularly and systematically throughout relevant United Nations bodies and mechanisms .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
UNHCR also noted the continuing cooperation and information _ sharing with the relevant mechanism of the Commission , specifically noting the logistical support and information-sharing and collaboration with United Nations human rights field missions , which it considered to be an important means of addressing the root causes issues and an integral part of comprehensive solutions .  
The role of UNDCP in alternative development continued to shift away from involvement in fully funded projects and towards advocacy and the provision of support to strengthen the technical , managerial , monitoring and communication capacities of relevant government institutions responsible for alternative development at the national level .  
The main activities are aimed at , inter alia , raising public awareness , improving understanding of money-laundering , promoting the adoption of relevant legislation , improving law enforcement capacities to combat money-laundering , training and developing infrastructure for the implementation of an effective money-laundering strategy .  
A number of Governments have taken action to provide basic health services for youth ; promote good sanitation and hygiene practices among youth ; develop health education and accessible , available and affordable primary health care services ( including services related to sexual and reproductive health and relevant education in those fields , such as information about sexually transmitted diseases , such as human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) ) ; eliminate sexual abuse of young people ; and combat malnutrition among young people .  
In its continuing effort to promote and develop policies and programmes for older persons , the ESCAP secretariat is preparing a directory of national focal points on ageing in Asia and the Pacific ; a directory of non-governmental organizations active in dealing with older persons in the region ; and a bibliography of international and regional mandates and relevant documents concerning ageing and older persons .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the mountain agenda and improving coordination of efforts to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain development , largely as a result of international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations consultations , which have provided a focus on key mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both the global and regional levels .

Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , there is a global expansion of illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic and designer drugs , which threatens the health , safety and well-being of millions of persons , in particular young people , in all countries , as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Stresses that the special session should , as noted in Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 17 , be devoted to assessing the existing situation within the framework of a comprehensive and balanced approach that includes all aspects of the problem , with a view to strengthening international cooperation to address the problem of illicit drugs within the framework of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 198810 and other relevant conventions and international instruments ;

Further , despite pressure from staff in the Office of the Prosecutor and from both Prosecutors to provide day-to-day operational leadership as the senior officer , the Deputy Prosecutor did not assume the role : the Office continued to operate without sufficient staff and other resources ; without sufficient staff prosecutors who possessed enough relevant legal experience to direct the investigations and to prepare and conduct the trials ; and without critical day-to-day operational guidance . 
Even though the orbit is perturbed by the lunisolar gravitational influence , the solar radiation and the asymmetric geopotential , there is no relevant secular change of the orbital parameters .

Since UNCTAD did not have the resources to handle all the legal issues relevant to international trade and trade-related services , it could focus on a number of priority areas such as assisting developing countries in the modernization of trade-related national legislation , organization of educational programmes , preparation of information handbooks on legal aspects of international trade , advising Governments on measures to overcome legal impediments to the use of EDI , disseminating information on legislative reforms on issues such as electronic commerce and trade-related services , and legal assistance to Trade Points .

The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations . 
One issue that warrants special attention relates to the new firms which have been operating in several countries and whose formal lawfulness , in the light of the relevant national and international legislation , is not open to question , as they are covered by the gaps and loopholes that would prevent their activities from being classified as mercenary stricto sensu . 
Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral , bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region ,

Many Governments indicated an urgent need to provide specific training for law enforcement officials on relevant issues , with a view to increasing the effectiveness of border controls , upgrading skills in identifying motor vehicles with false documents or altered security features and improving the reliability of document controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle .  
Encourages further technical , educational and economic cooperation among States , in coordination with the United Nations Children 's Fund , other relevant United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations , towards the development of human resources by nurturing the talents and potentials of children with disabilities , the development and dissemination of appropriate technologies and know-how , and the development of common standards for the national evaluation of childhood disability , with due regard for the situation of poor or developing countries ;  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national , and international programmes and projects for the Year , and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as the international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
Proceeding from the above , and taking into account the increasing tension in the region owing to the failure of the Government of Croatia to earn the necessary trust of the Serbs of the region and the continued resistance of Croatia to accept the return of a substantial number of refugees , it is incumbent on the Security Council to adopt a relevant resolution , as hitherto the presidential statements have , unfortunately , proved less than effective . 
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .

While the precise legal basis for such measures will need to be rooted in the text of each of the relevant treaties , the principal foundation is to be found in a teleological approach to interpretation which acknowledges that any other outcome is absurd in that it enables a delinquent State party to defeat the object and purpose of the implementation provisions .  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .

Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
Reiterates that the main objective of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty is to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation in implementing fully and effectively the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments agreed upon at the United Nations major conferences and summits organized since 1990 as they relate to poverty eradication ;  
Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community . 
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;

This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
The United Nations Security Coordinator formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Organization on current and potential security-related problems and is responsible for coordinating , planning and implementing inter-agency security and safety programmes and for acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation . 
This is achieved by analysing and understanding the key elements of international transactions , including the relevant elimination of constraints ; developing methods to facilitate transactions , including the relevant use of information technologies ; promoting both the use of these methods and associated best practices through channels such as governmental , industry and service associations ; coordinating and integrating the work under the subprogramme with other international organizations ; and securing coherence by cooperating with other interested parties in recognition that the work has broad application in the areas beyond global commerce .  
But most relevant to the theme of this most important international day of solidarity was the understanding expressed in the article that the rapid and sustained economic development we have experienced in Antigua and Barbuda is not a legacy of colonialism .  
In the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;

The Ministerial Council reaffirmed its absolute and unwavering belief in Iraq 's obligation to comply with all the relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular those pertaining to the release of Kuwaiti and third-country prisoners and detainees ; cooperate fully with the Special Commission in its investigation of Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction ; return all public and private property to Kuwait ; continue to comply fully with the compensation mechanism ; and refrain from all hostile or provocative acts directed against Kuwait and neighbouring States , pursuant to resolution 949 ( 1994 ) .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .

The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
United Nations agencies should encourage small States to adopt regional approaches , wherever advantageous , with relevant assistance justified in cost-benefit terms and focused on human resources development , environmental activities and reducing the administrative constraints imposed by small size .  
The Committee was concerned at the lack of an integrated and systematic approach by the national machinery and the relevant ministries to all areas covered by the Convention , in particular with regard to women in rural areas , vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities , young women and women in prisons .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries to improve energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ; "  
The Commission on Sustainable Development should consider this initiative in the coming years in exploring policies and measures necessary to implement eco-efficiency and , for this purpose , encourage the relevant bodies to adopt measures aimed at assisting developing countries in improving energy and material efficiency through the promotion of their endogenous capacity-building and economic development with enhanced and effective international support ;  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .

The assignment of costs for the Qana incident to one Member State represented an unwelcome departure from established principles as it attributed political responsibility , although the relevant political bodies of the Organization had not done so ; moreover , it ran contrary to the principle of collective responsibility .

The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;

For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
With a view to implementing paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 51 / 208 , the Secretary-General sought the assistance of relevant institutions and organizations inside and outside the United Nations system6 in order to seek their cooperation in collecting and coordinating information about international economic assistance available to affected third States and to explore innovative and practical measures of assistance to those States .

The meeting rose at 9.10 p.m .  
Recognizing that they both take a substantive interest in areas of common concern and are committed to promoting a more comprehensive and relevant treatment of the subject matter while avoiding unproductive duplication and inconsistency of recommendations , the two Commissions have developed an elaborate coordinating mechanism .  
It should be stressed , however , that the most efficient and effective way for a functional commission that wishes quite legitimately to contribute its own particular perspective on a multidimensional issue is to build its input on the basis of relevant analyses and policy recommendations provided by other functional commissions and other United Nations bodies , in particular those which have primary responsibility for addressing the underlying major issue , and in close consultation with them .  
Engage all relevant sectors , including non-governmental organizations , especially womens and youth organizations and professional associations , through ongoing participatory processes in the design , implementation , quality assurance , monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes , in ensuring that sexual and reproductive health information and services meet peoples needs and respect their human rights , including their right to access to good-quality services ;

This revolution is aimed at developing the country 's human resources by ensuring that the education system is relevant and geared to equip students with the requisite knowledge , skills and abilities for sustained , successful living in the twenty-first century .  
The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
The central theme of this review that population concerns are an indispensable part of national and international efforts to achieve equitable , sustained development is particularly relevant to small island developing States , such as Jamaica and many in the Caribbean .  
However , I am of the firm belief that with our strong conviction and commitment , coupled with the wide and constructive participation of all relevant actors and with the support of the international community , we will be able to achieve our common objectives , as set out in the ICPD recommendations .  
This provision has been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly as regards the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .  
Although it has been argued that there are no universally accepted international law principles regulating the position of employees of foreign States , relevant case law has often considered a contract of employment as merely a special type of commercial / private law contract .  
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .

Failure by a staff member to comply with his or her obligations under the Charter of the United Nations , the Staff Regulations and Staff Rules or other relevant administrative issuances , or to observe the standards of conduct expected of an international civil servant , may amount to unsatisfactory conduct within the meaning of staff regulation 10.2 , leading to the institution of disciplinary proceedings and the imposition of disciplinary measures for misconduct .  
It is also regrettable that UNAMET did not follow up on the advice of the Indonesian Task Force , and as earlier agreed between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General , on the need for a joint humanitarian mission involving UNAMET , the Indonesian Task Force and other relevant and competent United Nations agencies to address the problem of internally displaced persons and all its aspects in a comprehensive manner .

The positive impulses for pursuing cross-cutting issues of universal character , such as natural disaster reduction , created on the one hand by a division of labour between non-operational responsibilities for system-wide policy development , advocacy and coordination , and on the other hand , by distinct operational responsibilities for all relevant mandate bearers inside and outside the United Nations , in particular in the field of development .  
Two main issues will be addressed : ( i ) the legal and practical implications of the constitutional provisions relevant to indigenous and tribal peoples , and ( ii ) increasing cooperation between and among government officials , national and international organizations , and indigenous and tribal peoples within the framework of Convention No . 169 , which emphasizes consultation and participation .

This shows that the net of international legal commitments relevant for economic , social and cultural rights is fairly wider than would be assumed by considering only the number of ratifications of the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Currently , such methodologies are less effective than those developed for civil and political rights , although social and economic data from development agencies is increasingly being incorporated into the relevant analysis .  
The meeting held a discussion on economic , social and cultural rights and subsequently recommended that the inter-sessional workshop on the right to development and economic , social and cultural rights should focus , inter alia , on developing quantifiable benchmarks ; identifying obstacles to the realization of these rights ; and proposing relevant actions to strengthen national capacities for the promotion and protection of these rights .

In subsection ( c ) , regarding executive summaries , it is important to note that , while these summaries may serve the useful purpose of providing a brief , accurate presentation of a more lengthy document , it is inappropriate for OHCHR to develop standard formats for such summaries as the contents of all documents differ , and undue attention will necessarily be drawn to categories that OHCHR has a priori determined to be relevant , but are not necessarily reflective of the document 's contents .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
UNICEF promotes and supports physical and psychosocial recovery and social reintegration as the pillar of all humanitarian assistance policy and programmes and to that end , is committed to the rapid re-establishment of primary education in emergency situations , partly as an aim in itself and partly because relevant quality education helps to restore normality and enables children to cope better with stress .  
Inspections provide the High Commissioner with comprehensive and systematic assessments of UNHCR operations , focusing on those factors , both internal and external to UNHCR , considered most relevant to the effective and efficient discharge of UNHCRs responsibilities .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
The joint analysis carried out by the secretariats of UNCTAD and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) 1 ( WTO ) on current market access issues is still relevant and suggests that substantial improvement of market access , especially for exports of goods and services from developing countries , should be considered a major priority for the third Ministerial Conference of WTO and new multilateral trade negotiations .  
In this regard , attention was drawn to the relevant international conventions to which Kuwait had acceded ; 8 the inclusion in its bilateral agreements in the field of civil aviation of provisions relating to the safety of aviation ; its support for international and regional efforts to counter terrorism ; and its adoption of a series of practical and executive measures to protect its domestic security .

Distressed by the widespread violation of the principle of non-refoulement and of the rights of refugees and recalling that asylum applicants should have access to fair and expeditious status-determination procedures , the Assembly encouraged States that had not already done so to consider acceding to the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees and to other relevant refugee instruments , as applicable , and to relevant international human rights instruments .  
The seminar produced guidelines that recognize that forced evictions constitute prima facie violations of a wide range of internationally recognized human rights and can only be carried out under exceptional circumstances and in full accordance with relevant provisions of international human rights law .

Because worldwide economic problems pose a challenge to the social development efforts of individual countries , these issues should be approached in an integrated manner that involves national Governments , regional and multilateral organizations and relevant market actors .  
We believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that all countries have an obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of their own peoples in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international human rights instruments , and in the light of their respective national conditions and relevant laws .  
The United Nations International Drug Control Programme and other relevant international and regional organizations : ( i ) to promote the participation of target groups in the design of projects and facilitate the sharing of information on best strategies ; and ( ii ) to facilitate the creation of an international network promoting regular contact among youth involved in demand reduction activities and allowing them to stay informed and learn from one another .  
In order to create and maintain such political will , it is important to give broad publicity to this issue by widely disseminating relevant information on the subject , including the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting and the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly , and above all by publicizing the costs borne by a few countries in supporting the decisions of the Security Council adopted in the name of the international community as a whole .  
They were : the timely adjustment of domestic policies in developing countries ; the opening up of developed countries commodity markets and the provision of timely , relevant and affordable information and technology by those countries to commodity-dependent developing countries ; and a global effort to reduce trade and non-trade barriers in order to make the playing field level for all parties .

Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Notes with appreciation the growing number of developed countries participating in triangular cooperation and encourages the use of such cooperation by other countries and , in this context , requests the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries , in collaboration with the countries that have been supporting such cooperation , to document and disseminate relevant lessons learned and to identify options for the exploitation of the full potential of such cooperation ;

Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations , and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system ;

However , the workshop considered that the drafting mandate , which would focus on the rights-based approach , should be entrusted to the Sub-Commission as an expert body , while pursuing the usual broad consultative procedure involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the specialized agencies and all parties concerned .  
The Committee reiterates , in this connection , its request contained in its report on review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations that all future proposals by the Secretary-General on gratis personnel and the subsequent implementation of legislative mandates be in full compliance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and fully respect the relevant policies , procedures and regulations of the Organization ( A / 54 / 470 , para .  4 ) .  
The peace process would , however , be stalled so long as Israel continued to violate the rules of international law and international humanitarian law as well as the relevant resolutions of the United Nations . Respect for the provisions of those instruments was a prerequisite to progress in the peace process and to true improvement in the living conditions of the Palestinian people and the human rights situation . 
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;

The report lacks an objective approach to evaluating the repercussions of the implementation of the programme on the overall humanitarian situation in Iraq in that it neglects to make a comparative analysis of the present situation and the situation in the relevant sectors as it was prior to the imposition of sanctions and in that it ignores the cumulative impact of the sanctions on all the economic , social and cultural aspects of life for the Iraqi people , including future generations .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;

International cooperation to that end must be strengthened and the relevant international organizations must take concrete measures , such as technology transfer , financial support and scientific and technical training , in favour of the developing countries .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,

Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
For relevant least developed countries in particular , including small island developing States , this may represent a considerable expenditure in the short term , while having a bearing on the future mapping of the natural resources of the continental shelf .  
Governments call upon United Nations organizations , NGOs , the private sector and relevant civil society organizations to show strong political will and commitment to human development and direct investments to these critical areas .

Like the CCA , it is countrydriven , prepared with the broad participation of civil society , key donors and other relevant international finance institutions , and linked to agreed international development goals .  
These are clear forms of human loss which ( if the act causing them is recognized by the relevant legal system as wrongful ) can be compensated for in monetary terms , even though their assessment will always be a conventional and highly approximate matter .  
An institutional focal point at the national level , with its counterparts at decentralized levels , enables a country to evolve a coherent and coordinated approach with the involvement of relevant entities in the public and private sectors , and with NGOs .

Adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 of 22 December 1999,3 the text contained in the annex to the present decision as a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process , on the understanding that the preliminary agenda is of an indicative nature and will evolve during the substantive preparatory process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .  3 Paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 reads as follows :  
Further encouraging the deepening of the efforts of all relevant stakeholders , including at the regional level , as well as by civil society and the business sector , in support of the financing for development preparatory process and the high-level international intergovernmental event , within the framework of its substantive agenda ,

Possibility of naming a mediator acceptable to all relevant parties to facilitate arriving at a mutually satisfactory resolution of a debt crisis , as an additional voluntary option for debt restructuring .  
It is on this basis that we have decided that there is a need for at least a partnership among Governments of affected countries , relevant humanitarian organizations and specialized agencies to promote training in , access to and the use of technologies , to strengthen preparedness for and response to natural disasters and to enhance the transfer of current technologies and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on concessional and preferential terms , as may be mutually agreed .  
Invites the Bureau of the preparatory committee to play an active and important role in the intergovernmental preparations for the World Summit and to mobilize political support at the highest possible level in both developed and developing countries while pursuing the support of all heads of international organizations within the United Nations system and of international financial institutions and the Global Environment Facility and to actively support the role of the Committee in monitoring with a view to considering the reports of all relevant intergovernmental processes .

In conclusion , we hope that todays very broad discussion with the family of United Nations organs and agencies , relevant institutions and Member States will be a step forward to the successful implementation of a fully integrated and broad-based subregional approach aimed at addressing the multifaceted problems confronting the region and promoting durable peace and sustainable development in West Africa .  
As to his own preventive role , the Secretary-General thinks that it could be enhanced by increasing the use of interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions to volatile areas ; by developing regional prevention strategies with regional partners and the relevant United Nations organs and agencies ; by establishing an informal network of eminent persons ; and by improving the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
We , therefore , support the ideas contained in the report for strengthening the Secretary-Generals traditional roles in this area by , for example , increasing the use of interdisciplinary United Nations fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , developing regional preventive strategies with relevant regional organizations and establishing an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
In this regard , we call on the Security Council and the international community to redouble their efforts to convince the Government of Iraq to be more forthcoming and positive in addressing this issue and to resolve the entire matter on humanitarian , religious and moral grounds and in conformity with relevant Security Council resolutions .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .

It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
It is our conviction that the solution to the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly lies in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the additional protocols , as well as in the pertinent Security Council resolutions , which , once thoroughly observed , will provide the necessary conditions for a definitive settlement of the issues related to the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Congo in which the international community has a relevant role to play .  
In its agreed conclusions 2000 / 2 of 27 July 2000 , on the integrated and coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences , the Council invited its relevant functional commissions to consider a number of options listed in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General ( E / 2000 / 57 ) for enhancing the reviews of the major United Nations conferences and summits and to inform the Council for its consideration at its substantive session in 2001 of the outcome of their discussion .  
The Council therefore strongly encouraged Governments to pursue and strengthen their efforts to work towards achieving the goals of poverty eradication and reiterated the call for the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and the international community to take consistent , coherent , coordinated and joint action in support of national efforts to eradicate poverty , with particular attention to employment creation and work and the empowerment and advancement of women .  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
This report responds to relevant decisions taken by the Executive Board on the reports of the Executive Director to the Economic and Social Council over the past several years , in particular decision 1999 / 6 ( E / ICEF / 1999 / 7 / Rev . 1 ) , which requested the Executive Director to ensure that future reports to the Council advance the Boards wish for greater analytical effort , selected focus on key issues , problem-oriented reporting and discussions of lessons learned .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
On the basis of the foregoing and given all of these facts , the Government of the Republic of Iraq urges you to order a prompt inquiry , to be conducted by reliable medical and scientific authorities in cooperation with the relevant Iraqi scientific bodies , into the use of depleted uranium against Iraq and to expose such use as a direct cause of injury to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and of damage to all aspects of the environment .  
The Secretary-General endorses the proposed formula for determining the number and salary levels of resident auditors that should be deployed to selected peacekeeping missions , on the understanding that the formula would be used as a guideline and the actual requirements in each case would be based on a detailed assessment of the related risks and other relevant factors .  
Following submission of the first part of the compilation to the Commission in 1996 , and at the request of the Commission and on the basis of the compilation , the Representative and the legal team , which included experts from international agencies and organizations whose mandates were directly relevant to the needs of the displaced , began to develop a comprehensive normative framework of protection and assistance for the internally displaced in the form of guiding principles on internal displacement . 
A final meeting , hosted by the Government of Austria in Vienna in January 1998 , widened the consultative process still further and included legal experts from the various geographic regions as well as representatives from a broad cross-section of relevant United Nations and other international agencies , regional organizations and NGOs . 
Though important steps were taken in accordance with the Programme for Reform to close this gap - the designation of the Emergency Relief Coordinator as the focal point for coordinating the international response to the assistance and protection needs of internally displaced persons , the designation of focal points on internally displaced persons in many of the relevant agencies and NGOs , and more regular discussion of issues of internal displacement in the IASC - the response to specific situations of internal displacement has remained ad hoc and still largely focused on assistance .  
The representative of Ukraine requested that the report of the Ad Hoc Committee reflect his view that the travaux prparatoires should indicate that the words state-to-state transactions and state transfers were included in article 4 , paragraph 2 , on the understanding that they included state-to-state transactions involving firearms and state transfers of firearms effected on the basis of relevant agreements concluded between the Governments of the States concerned or on behalf of those Governments by virtue of powers conferred by them .  
For each State or regional economic integration organization ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to this Protocol after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of such action , this Protocol shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date of deposit by such State or organization of the relevant instrument or on the date this Protocol enters into force pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article , whichever is the later . 
It is pertinent to recall in this connection that in paragraphs 27 and 28 of his report dated 7 October 1998 on the first full year of the implementation of the reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment ( A / 53 / 465 ) , the Secretary-General indicated that the impact of the retroactive implementation of the new procedures could only be evaluated when all relevant claims had been processed for liquidated or liquidating missions and that the definitive comparison of the two systems was not available at that time .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
Algeria , which had always encouraged the international community to combat the scourge of terrorism in strict accordance with the principles of international law , had adopted national measures , acceded to relevant regional and international conventions and was trying to fully fit in with the frameworks of cooperation established at all levels .  
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
The Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty identified the need for new guiding principles , which would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of extreme poverty , that clarified definitional issues within the framework of human rights and that set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
We stress the importance of a G-77 / G-8 dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership as an essential mechanism for the discussion of emerging and urgent issues relevant to the strengthening of a global partnership for development to further strengthen the efforts of the international community with respect to adopting a positive agenda and addressing development issues of international concern , including the implementation of the agreed commitments and outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits .  
The Committee recommends that the general principles of the Convention , in particular the provisions of its articles 2 , 3 and 12 , be appropriately integrated in all relevant legislation concerning children and applied in all political , judicial and administrative decisions and in projects , programmes and services which have an impact on all children , including non-citizen children , and guide the determination of policy-making at every level and actions taken by social and health welfare institutions , courts of law and administrative authorities .

Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Monitoring the implementation of sustainable development goals through the assessment of data collected at the national , regional and international levels is one of the main objectives of the Division for Sustainable Development . 16 As decided by the Commission on Sustainable Development in 1993 , the Division invites Governments and organizations to submit the relevant information to the Commission . 
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
The transition to a child rights approach can be hampered by : conservative economic and social policies characterized by paternalism and political patronage ; the insufficient capacity of local-level bodies to assume the new responsibilities ; the continued application of archaic law regarding minors ; resistance to child rights concepts by executive , legislative and / or judicial officials ; and the absence of valid , timely and relevant data and indicators on the fulfilment and violation of rights .  
The basic consent provision is contained in article 246 , paragraphs 1 and 2 , whereby the coastal State in the exercise of its jurisdiction has the right to regulate , authorize and conduct marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf in accordance with relevant provisions of the Convention .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;

By its decision 1 / 1 , the Committee adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 , a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process as contained in the annex to that decision , on the understanding that this preliminary agenda was of an indicative nature and would evolve during the substantive process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
Its activities included raising awareness among families and communities of the rights of the child ; publicizing the relevant laws and instruments , such as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child ; promoting the creation of nurseries , day-care centres , orphanages and welcoming centres ; supporting private initiatives for training and supervision during early childhood ; and taking charge of juvenile delinquents by re-educating them when they were in specialized institutions or in prison and by helping them with subsequent reintegration .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out its revised mandate , which is to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Reiterates its requests that the relevant special rapporteurs and the special mechanisms of the Commission undertake missions to the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation without delay and expresses serious concern that the thematic special rapporteurs or representatives on the question of torture , on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on internally displaced persons , who have requested to undertake visits have not yet received an answer and urges the Government of the Russian Federation to give favourable consideration to their requests as a matter of priority ;  
Urges the relevant authorities to take all necessary measures to avoid and limit the most cruel forms of corporal punishment in particular by applying alternative punishment and taking into account attenuating circumstances to the maximum extent possible provided for in national legislation and consistent with international human rights norms and standards ;  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
It will also be important to receive proposals from CPF on streamlining national reporting formats required by various forest-related international organizations and instruments , taking also into account the streamlining work on reporting in other relevant forums . 13 UNFF may wish to focus on advancing the common understanding and use of those key concepts , definitions and terms that could benefit greatly the implementation at a practical level , as well as the monitoring of progress . 
In Economic and Social Council resolution 2000 / 35 , the Council decided to invite executive heads of relevant organizations of the United Nations system and heads of other relevant international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments to form a collaborative partnership on forests to support the work of UNFF and to enhance cooperation and coordination among participants , and facilitate and promote coordinated and cooperative action , including joint programming .  
Other relevant and interested international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments that are not members of CPF , including non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups , will be invited to contribute to specific activities of CPF , for example , certain projects , programmes , expert meetings and other activities , where their competencies would enrich the thematic work of CPF in the implementation of IPF / IFF proposals for action .  
The programme of work aims at the adoption and implementation of an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the right to development , a significant enhancement of support for that right from relevant United Nations bodies and a significant increase in the recognition of economic , social and cultural rights as human rights and their integration into the strategies and programmes of international organizations , agencies and financial and developmental institutions .  
The programme further aims at reinforcing the role of the United Nations as the unique worldwide forum for the discussion and resolution , with the participation of all relevant actors , of human rights matters of international concern , through its support for human rights bodies and organs and its adoption and progressive implementation of an improved treaty monitoring system , which deals with multiple reporting obligations and is based on a comprehensive national approach .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
In this context , human resources directors meet prior to the sessions of the International Civil Service Commission to review matters under consideration by the Commission , appoint spokespersons to represent the executive heads of the participating organizations at the Commission sessions and put forward common positions on the relevant issues under consideration .

This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .

After causing the incident , the US plane intruded into China 's territory and landed at a Chinese airport without permission from the Chinese side , which further violated relevant provisions of international laws and Chinese laws , thereby constituting a violation of China 's sovereign right and territorial air space .  
Obviously , the whole plane collision incident took place in China 's exclusive economic zone .  The US side smashed the airplane of the Chinese side , and illegally entered Chinese territory .  As the victim country , the country where the incident took place , and the country where the aircraft that caused the incident landed , the Chinese side enjoys jurisdiction over the whole incident , including rights to conduct investigations on the incident , according to relevant international laws and regulations and Chinese laws .  
Instead of giving sincere and friendly remarks , the United States couched in harsh terms and stressed with an intransigent attitude that the plane was US property and territory .

Pursuant to the UN Convention on Maritime Law , a foreign aircraft 's " freedom of flight " over another country 's exclusive economic zone is preconditioned by observance of the relevant coastal country 's law and international law , forbidden from activities that may harm the coastal country 's sovereignty , safety , and national interests .  
According to the relevant stipulations of the 1982 " UN Convention on the Law of the Sea , " exclusive economic zones are neither territorial waters nor international waters , and they themselves have formed a category of regions with a special legal regime .  
To exercise sovereign right and exclusive jurisdiction over its exclusive economic zone , the coastal state is entitled to draw up relevant laws and rules to restrict the overflight freedom enjoyed by another state 's aircraft in the airspace over the exclusive economic zone .  Doing so , the coastal state can safeguard the aerial traffic order and flight safety in the zone and protect its legal rights and interest .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .

Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
Governments , according to their capacities and available resources and with the cooperation of the United Nations and other relevant organizations , should promote centres of excellence for training in hazardous waste management , building on appropriate national institutions and encouraging international cooperation , inter alia , through institutional links between developed and developing countries .

Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Invites the working group on the agenda for development to give consideration to the proposal of the Secretary-General that advantage be taken of the presence of high-level representatives during the early part of the sessions of the General Assembly to conduct a dialogue and to convene special sessions of the Assembly on major themes relevant to the current and emerging economic and social issues in the global agenda , including those identified under the agenda for development ;  
Recognizing that the grave suffering of the great majority of human beings who live in conditions of poverty demands the immediate attention of the international community and the adoption of concrete actions and measures towards the eradication of poverty within the framework of relevant forthcoming United Nations conferences , particularly the World Summit for Social Development , and within the context of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty ,  
In the Republic of Croatia , the Zagreb-based field staff through its numerous contacts with non-governmental organizations , its participation in relevant conferences and its exceptional access to top government officials , provided the Special Rapporteur with vital information , enabling him to make timely observations on the changing human rights situation .  
Review the impact of structural adjustment programmes on social development , including , where appropriate , by means of gender sensitive social impact assessments and other relevant methods , in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and improve their positive impact ; the cooperation of international financial institutions in the review could be requested by interested countries ;  
Encouraging the production of relevant studies / research to assess the consequences of global and technological changes on social integration and the production of evaluations of the policies and programmes put in place to achieve the various components of social integration ; and encouraging national and international exchanges and dissemination of information on innovative models and successful practices ;  
Implementation of the commitments of the international community to the special needs and vulnerabilities of the small-island developing States , in particular by providing effective means including adequate , predictable , new and additional resources for social development programmes in accordance with the Barbados Declaration and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Programmes of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States ;  
Promoting effective enjoyment of all civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and access to existing social protection and public services by , in particular , through encouraging the ratification and ensuring the full implementation of all relevant human rights instruments ;  
It was important that the strengthening of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime should be linked with broader international cooperation in the sphere of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy , both at the bilateral level and within the framework of the relevant international organizations .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
Although the status quo in Angola is a cause for optimism that peace will be restored to that country , it is vital that the two parties continue to demonstrate the political will and the commitment necessary for the achievement of peace and national reconciliation through strict and timely compliance with the Acordos de Paz , the Lusaka Protocol and the relevant Security Council resolutions , in the interests of durable peace , security and economic and social development in their country .

Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
In order to combat effectively the increase in , and the growing international character and effects of , acts of terrorism , States should enhance their cooperation in this area through , in particular , systematizing the exchange of information concerning the prevention and combating of terrorism , as well as by effective implementation of the relevant international conventions and conclusion of mutual judicial assistance and extradition agreements on a bilateral , regional and multilateral basis ;  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
Thirdly , China held that all non-nuclear-weapon States parties , particularly the developing countries , were entitled under the NPT to engage in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and to acquire relevant technology and assistance for their national economic development . 
China , as a State party and particularly as a developing country with a considerable nuclear industrial capability , strictly abided by the relevant provisions of the NPT to ensure the exclusive use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and had engaged in cooperation with other developing countries in that field , which would increase as his country continued its economic reform and development . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Reiterates the importance of ensuring access , for all persons seeking international protection , to fair and efficient procedures for the determination of refugee status or , as appropriate , to other mechanisms to ensure that persons in need of international protection are identified and granted such protection , while not diminishing the protection afforded to refugees under the terms of the 1951 Convention , the 1967 Protocol and relevant regional instruments ;

National plans and investment in science should further global environment and developmental observing systems and should strengthen internationally coordinated scientific programmes on environment and development involving relevant United Nations bodies and major international scientific bodies .  
The information on which decisions and actions are based is sometimes too sectoral to be relevant to complex real-world problems , out of date , partial to a particular geographical or cultural perspective , or driven by emotional reactions or interpretations .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Also believe that the current mandate leaves substantial room for a more assertive and effective mission by UNPROFOR and relevant regional organizations , especially bearing in mind Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , although there could be potential enhancement of the existing Security Council mandate of UNPROFOR ;  
Environmental monitoring data and other relevant information , including consumer information , which are currently lacking in many developing countries , need to be developed urgently so as to provide a sound information base for policy formulation and decision-making on changing the current unsustainable production and consumption patterns .  
The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression , although the Security Council may , in conformity with the Charter , conclude that a determination that an act of aggression has been committed would not be justified in the light of other relevant circumstances , including the fact that the acts concerned or their consequences are not of sufficient gravity .  
The breadth of an adjacent area of the high seas , measured from the outer boundary of an economic zone , shall be determined , up to a maximum of 70 nautical miles , on the basis of the best available scientific data by the relevant subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or by agreement between the coastal and other States concerned .  
In addition , the United Nations system , in coordination with other relevant organizations , is asked by Agenda 21 to provide recommendations for harmonizing the development of indicators at the national , regional and global levels , and for incorporating a suitable set of these indicators in common , regularly updated , and widely accessible reports and databases , for use at the international level , subject to national sovereignty considerations ( para . 
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
For clusters of indicators , various organizations will have the task of assuming a leading role in a transparent consultative process for the purpose of further developing the indicators , as relevant , including the underlying methodology , and of analysing the data availability for each indicator in order to provide a full description of each indicator in a set of methodology sheets .  
More important , there is a widespread belief among politicians and senior government officials that the adoption of sound environmental practices would result in lower rates of economic growth in the short run , that pollution control would divert scarce resources from more relevant social areas and that it would lead to price increases .  
They note that an informal round table that includes representatives of all agencies , as well as members of the academic community and relevant non-governmental organizations , is useful for the purposes of developing innovative ideas and concepts relating to how development communication should be understood , as far as this concept has not yet been defined according to one universal standard .

The Working Group recognized that the Convention on Biological Diversity , which has now entered into force , will be the principal mechanism for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and provides an excellent basis for coordinating relevant instruments .  
During the work on the new arrangement and the present draft resolution , which will be adopted today , one Member State , regrettably , expressed low tolerance for the legitimate interests of Croatia , a Member State , and instead directed efforts into forms of short-term political pragmatism , at the expense of legal and operative logic of the relevant United Nations documents .  
A review and recent evaluation of the experience of past capacities and needs matching exercises sponsored by the Special Unit for TCDC suggests the need to ensure that these exercises are an adequately prepared , demand-driven process where needs and capacities identified are realistic in terms of their potential application and relevant to key development objectives of recipient countries , and that adequate funding has been arranged to carry out the resulting agreements .  
By resolution 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 , the General Assembly decided that the governing body of the United Nations Children 's Fund should be transformed into an Executive Board and that the Executive Board should have 36 members , to be elected with due regard to equitable geographical representation and other relevant factors , with a view to ensuring the most effective and broadest representation .

The conference papers , written by leading scholars , covered an extremely broad field in terms of geography and intellectual disciplines and were directly relevant to matters of great contemporary international concern .  
The Commission for Social Development would play a central role , in particular from the perspective of social integration ; the Secretariat would report to the Council on the activities and findings of other relevant functional commissions ; in deciding , the year before , on the contents of its review the Council would take into account the related choice of theme ( s ) for the integrated consideration of the follow-up of major conferences .  
It is encouraging that the Council decided , in its 1995 agreed conclusions , to select the theme related to the follow-up to conferences at its previous substantive session to allow for adequate preparations by the functional commissions , other relevant intergovernmental bodies and the Secretariat .  
Gravely concerned that , despite increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations , the illicit demand for , production of and traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , including synthetic or designer drugs , has expanded globally and , therefore , continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems and the stability , national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States ,

Governments and educational institutions , in cooperation with regional and international organizations , could establish or enhance vocational and technical training that is relevant to current and prospective employment conditions .  
To the contrary , in the prevailing legal and political order in Iraq with life-threatening laws applicable to persons expressing any opposition to the Government , the conduct of the referendum made a mockery of relevant international human rights standards .  
Further requests the Secretary-General to elaborate his proposals to convene special sessions of the General Assembly and summit-level meetings of a representative character , on major issues relevant to the dialogue on international economic cooperation for development , including those identified in the agenda for development ;  
Therefore , there must be a workable legal framework consistent with modern labour management practices that guarantees to all civil servants due process and equal protection equivalent to the rights and principles they would enjoy under relevant national laws .

Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure , where appropriate , an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact , bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies ;  
a similar vein , recognizing that information provided in notifications may , in certain instances , be proprietary and sensitive for commercial reasons , the information provided shall be treated as confidential and restricted to the Commission and IAEA , to the extent that this is consistent with their respective responsibilities under Security Council resolution 715 ( 1991 ) , other relevant resolutions and the plans .

Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit-transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;

The eradication of poverty requires that a sustained , collective commitment and effort be mounted by Governments , local administrations , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and also requires that anti-poverty strategies and programmes be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
that the effective functioning of treaty bodies established in accordance with the relevant provisions of international instruments on human rights plays a fundamental role and hence represents an important continuing concern of the United Nations ,  
its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to make available additional human and financial resources to enhance the capability of the High Commissioner and of the Centre to fulfil effectively their respective mandates and their ability to carry out mandated operational activities and to coordinate efficiently with other relevant parts of the United Nations system on logistical and administrative questions , having due regard to the need to finance and implement activities of the United Nations related to development ;  
additional relevant Security Council resolutions , in particular resolutions 824 ( 1993 ) of 6 May 1993 and 836 ( 1993 ) of 4 June 1993 , in which the Council declared that Sarajevo , Tuzla , _ epa , Gora _ de , Biha _ , Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas , that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to , from and within the areas ,  
Supreme Council discussed Iraq 's implementation of Security Council resolutions relating to its aggression against Kuwait and expressed its deep concern that the Iraqi Government was continuing to fail to implement in full some fundamental aspects of its international obligations under those resolutions and its dubious conduct with regard to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , which constituted a violation of the terms of the cease-fire laid down in resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant United Nations resolutions .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Just as Israel has the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries and free from threats or acts of force , as affirmed by Security Council resolution 242 ( 1967 ) , the territorial integrity , sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries should also be strictly respected , in accordance with the relevant Security Council resolutions , including resolution 425 ( 1978 ) .  
The Committee , taking into account the assurance given by the Secretariat in paragraph 77 above , requested its Chairman to transmit a letter to the chairmen of intergovernmental bodies that received written meeting records to inform them of the relevant discussion within the Committee and of the notional costs of written meeting records and unedited verbatim transcripts , and to invite them to consider the possibility of requesting the Secretariat to issue unedited transcripts of one meeting for comparison purposes with a view to the possible substitution of such transcripts for their usual records in the future .  
It was also observed that while the text deserved to be kept on the Special Committee 's agenda , the heading and the content of the draft document should be more concise and clearly defined , its structure could be rationalized and its provisions dealing with the sources of funding for the relevant mechanisms should be based on a more realistic approach .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of illicit arms trafficking .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1995 and the results of its operations for the year then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority .  
We therefore stress the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement leading to restoration of the Palestinians ' legitimate rights , particularly the rights to self-determination and to establish an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles underlying the Madrid Conference .  
This commitment must be proven by the actual , unconditional implementation of all relevant agreements thus far concluded , to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their legitimate rights , including their right to self-determination and to the establishment of their own independent State , with Jerusalem as its capital .  
Joint action in the field of crime prevention and the elimination of international terrorism envisages closer cooperation between central , regional and border authorities through efficient communications and exchange of information ; a commitment to accede to all relevant international conventions that prevent and punish international crime and terrorism ; joining and participation in specialized regional forums for discussing the problems of illicit drug-trafficking , organized crime and regional anti-terrorist cooperation ; and the elaboration of a regional programme to combat organized crime .  
The relevant provisions of the Summit 's final document , agreed at the highest level , could play a most important role in the positive development of negotiations both within the OSCE Minsk process and in all other current mediatory efforts of the OSCE . For several years since the end of the cold war active discussions have been taking place in the world on the transformation of international relations .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
While that communiqu , among other things , calls for strengthening economic and monetary cooperation and for the provision of necessary multilateral support for development , it is astonishing to witness how one of the members of that group , in total disregard of those stated purposes , which are relevant issues to the follow-up of the Copenhagen Summit , and in pursuance of its own short-sighted and politically motivated interests , vehemently imposes unilateral coercive measures through the adoption of legislation with extraterritorial effects against other countries .  
The IAEA 's 1995 annual report clearly demonstrates that the Agency continues to play a vital role in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and in fostering global peace and security as provided for in its statute and relevant international instruments .  
Thus , any State which is individually capable of assuming primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security and whose candidature is acceptable at both the regional and global levels can become a permanent member of the Security Council through the relevant procedure .  
We commend the commitments made at national level to the implementation of relevant recommendations through , inter alia , the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources and through increased allocation of resources to the social sector .  
Furthermore , the continuing measures against Cuba , contrary to the letter and spirit of General Assembly resolutions , are most definitely incompatible with the position and stature of a permanent member of the Security Council In the absence of any move by the United States to repeal the relevant Act , Member States may be justified in concluding that the United States has adopted a negative attitude by ignoring the will and expressed wishes of members of the General Assembly . 
Hence , we emphasize the importance of making rapid progress towards a final settlement , which would ensure that the Palestinian people is granted its legitimate rights , especially its right to self-determination and to establish an independent state with Al-Quds as its capital , in accordance with relevant international resolutions and the basic principles of the Madrid Conference .  
My specific proposal is to suggest that the Fifth Committee , after adoption of the draft resolution by the Main Committee concerned on the basis of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions , will take note of the estimate of additional requirements contained in the programme budget implications , on the understanding that such additional appropriation as may be necessary will be determined in the context of a revised appropriation , taking into account all relevant information , including the performance report .  
It further emphasizes the paramount importance of strict compliance with existing arms limitations and disarmament agreements relevant to outer space , including bilateral agreements , and with the existing legal regime concerning the use of outer space , including wide participation in such a legal regime .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners and the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
An annual analytical report on the thematic issues before the Commission , in accordance with the multi-year work programme , including , as far as possible , progress made in national and international implementation and including progress made by the Bretton Woods institutions , other United Nations specialized agencies and other relevant entities , based on available existing data and statistics ;  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Reaffirms the need for ensuring an effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , and major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
An [ annual ] analytical report on the thematic issues before the Commission , in accordance with the multi-year work programme , including , as far as possible , progress made in national [ and international ] implementation , [ including United Nations specialized agencies and other relevant entities and the Bretton Woods institutions , ] based on available existing data and statistics ;  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fisheries-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community , and invites the relevant specialized agencies , including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , as well as regional and subregional fisheries organizations and arrangements , to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end ;  
Noting that the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space , taking into account its previous efforts since its establishment in 1985 and seeking to enhance its functioning in qualitative terms , continued the examination and identification of various issues , existing agreements and existing proposals , as well as future initiatives relevant to the prevention of an arms race in outer space , [ 3 ] / and that this contributed to a better understanding of a number of problems and to a clearer perception of the various positions ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
The international community has already defined a number of indicators relevant to reproductive health , and WHO is working on additional qualitative and quantitative indicators for global monitoring ;  
It has also proposed a joint mission of high-level representatives of international and regional organizations to visit Somalia and to meet with all relevant personalities and factions to convey the resolve of the international organizations to assist the Somali people and to express the hope that a conference on national reconciliation may be convened at any venue of their choice .  
Particularly relevant were : the country 's limited economic capacities , depending on farm production which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
The host countries may request the Secretariat of the United Nations , within existing resources , to disseminate information which would be helpful to the diplomatic community in resolving the debt problems , including , inter alia , provisions of relevant international legal instruments and United Nations documents as well as information provided by the host countries on cost of living at a location concerned and relevant provisions of national legislation ;  
Other recommendations included the need to identify pivotal countries to serve as catalysts for promoting and implementing TCDC , the promotion of triangular cooperation arrangements under which donors agreed to fund exchanges among developing countries , the identification of subject-specific TCDC products , the expansion of TCDC-INRES into a multidimensional database , including information on several relevant centres of excellence , expert services and project experiences , as well as supporting the already existing institutional capacities in the developing countries .  
Requests its Bureau , in cooperation with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme , to adjust the provisional agenda for the tenth session , as approved at the ninth session , taking fully into account the results of the ninth session , as well as developments relevant to technical cooperation among developing countries throughout the world , including at the United Nations and other important international forums .  
A sustained , collective commitment and effort shall be mounted by Governments , local administrations , all relevant actors of civil society , including non-governmental organizations , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including the United Nations system and relevant subregional , regional and other international organizations , and anti-poverty strategies and programmes shall be designed , implemented and monitored with the full and effective participation of people living in poverty ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Such progress reports should avoid the need for additional reporting at the national level ; the Commission may wish to urge close cooperation , coordinated by the United Nations Secretariat , among a wide range of organizations currently engaged in relevant information-gathering and analysis exercises .  
There had been great progress in the human rights field since the establishment of the Organization , but , as the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights had stressed , the relevant instruments must be strengthened in order to make them more effective and so as to establish a better balance between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and economic , social and cultural rights , on the other .  
Discussing issues related to availability , accessibility and practical applications of ERS data , the participants noted , among other things , that present and potential users of the data should be more exposed to and trained in the basic sciences underlying microwave remote sensing technology , so that they could more fully benefit from the use of both the technology and the relevant data .  
Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations , as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with the donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize , within existing resources , specific consultative groups , when requested by the land-locked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional level and draw up action programmes for the period 1996-1997 ;  
Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in formulating international measures to deal with the special problems of the land-locked developing countries , and urges the Conference , inter alia , to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities , institutions and services , monitor the implementation of agreed measures , collaborate in all relevant initiatives , including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations , and serve as a focal point on cross-regional issues of interest to land-locked developing countries ;  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .

Commenting on the need to assist many developing countries , especially the least developed countries , with the promotion of exports , he said the EU had taken note of the suggestion in the Trade and Development Report 1996 for establishing an international marketing and information service , but was of the view that such assistance should take place at a level as close as possible to the relevant industry and be based upon detailed understanding of export capabilities .

Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution .

The United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education shall be guided by the definition and normative basis set out in part I of the present Plan of Action and shall further be directed to creating the broadest possible awareness and understanding of all of the norms , concepts and values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and in other relevant international human rights instruments .

Governments should play an active role in the implementation of the programme of the Decade through the development of national plans of action for human rights education , the introduction or strengthening of national human rights curricula in their formal educational systems , the conducting of national information campaigns on human rights and the opening of public access to human rights resource , information and training centres , as well as through enhanced donor support for relevant voluntary funds and international and national human rights education programmes .

For purposes of the High Commissioner 's report , all participating national focal points , international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations , specialized agencies and programmes , and interested others , shall be requested to provide relevant information to the High Commissioner , based upon their own independent assessments and activities .  
We think that it is necessary to establish the practice of convening regular meetings between the official representatives of these organizations , in order to exchange opinions on a future security model for Europe , to divide their responsibilities properly within the framework of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security in the OSCE region , and to elaborate relevant arrangements for coordinating their activities and decision-making .

Calls upon all the parties to cooperate fully , and in good faith , in the prompt formation and functioning of all of the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair local elections at the municipal level in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ,  
Illicit drugs were not a great social problem in his country , but it recognized their evil effects , and had therefore taken part in relevant international and regional conferences , and had signed bilateral agreements and international conventions .  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;

Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
The Commission decided to set up a working group composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the international instruments adopted by the States concerned .  
The mandate contained in resolution 1991 / 42 to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned covers both administrative and judicial detentions and , among the latter , those prior to , during and after trial .  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
His delegation had actively participated in every aspect of the work , as the United States was committed to the establishment of a fair , effective and truly international criminal court that met all relevant standards of due process and strengthened both international and national law enforcement and military justice interests .  
Accordingly , in light of the international strategic importance of the Gulf region , the Council renewed its call to the international community and the relevant international organizations to make active efforts to transform that region into a zone free of weapons of mass destruction .  
The global mandate of the United Nations spans economic , social , security , political , humanitarian and human rights issues , which is why the United Nations is active across virtually the full range of issues relevant to democratization and can help integrate these issues into a wider effort linking peacekeeping , refugee assistance , relief efforts , reconstruction and development .  
With the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , held at Rio de Janeiro in June 1992 , the United Nations began a series of international conferences that have brought together not only all States , but also relevant non-governmental organizations and other representatives of civil society to focus on interlocking economic and social issues by considering their impact on the human person and human communities .  
The Commission noted , bearing in mind the role of the Economic and Social Council in overall coordination , that increased dialogue between the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Economic and Social Council , the chairpersons and secretariats , as appropriate , of the other functional commissions , other subsidiary bodies and related bodies , including the relevant executive boards , would assist in identifying issues that could be addressed under the agenda item on emerging issues and trends .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
In the light of the foregoing , Ukraine considers as timely and topical the proposal contained in paragraph 3 of the Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996 / 26 entitled Minimum humanitarian standards for considering the possibility of reviewing national legislation relevant to situations of public emergency with a view to ensuring that it meets the requirements of the rule of law and does not involve discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , sex , language , religion or social origin .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
Other delegations expressed the view that those organizational units should be merged with other relevant organizational units of the Secretariat or consolidated under the umbrella of a high-level official of the Secretariat to be responsible for the implementation of all action programmes on African development .  
The Committee noted that in his statement , the Director of the Office for Outer Space Affairs had invited Member States , space agencies and relevant national and international organizations to consider supporting the preparations for the UNISPACE III Conference by seconding experts to the Office at the junior or senior expert level , by co-sponsoring workshops related to the additional components of the Conference and through other voluntary contributions .  
The annual convening of a seminar devoted specifically to issues related to the economic and social challenges facing the Palestinian people during the transitional period has proved very useful and the Committee intends to continue this practice in order to give the international donor community , including United Nations bodies and agencies , the opportunity to exchange views with representatives of the Palestinian Authority and internationally renowned experts on relevant issues .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1996 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial period then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority . 
The latest initiative to Judaize East Jerusalem with the building of a new Jewish settlement on Arab land in Jebel Abu Ghneim , in a highly symbolic place , is a deliberate provocation in the light of the relevant resolutions adopted by overwhelming majority of the international community at the two urgent meetings of the General Assembly and at its emergency special session .  
It has been recognized in all international legal and political forums that East Jerusalem is an organic part of the West Bank occupied since 1967 and that the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 , applies there , as do the relevant Security Council resolutions .  
For all those reasons , and with a view to preserving the religious , cultural and historical character of Jerusalem , the Government of Jordan continues to maintain , restore and protect the Holy Places , now under the yoke of occupation , and to provide the necessary support for the relevant officials , with a view to protecting those places from all dangers pending the final solution to which we look forward .  
It is relevant here to highlight the need for the international community to continue its cooperation with the Central American countries by providing the required economic , financial and technical assistance in sustained fashion and on favourable terms in order to make the goals of the programme of sustainable development in Central America achievable .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
Any dialogue on fresh water should be based first and foremost on the acceptance and recognition of the relevant universally recognized principles of international law , in particular the principle of equitable and reasonable utilization of water resources .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
It is the continuing conviction of the expert , as stressed in his last report to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 36 , para . 81 ) , that only a high-level multilateral commission which comprises all relevant parties in the former Yugoslavia and which enjoys the full support of the international community will be in a position to exert sufficient pressure on all authorities concerned to disclose the relevant information and to proceed with the excavation of mass graves .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines including engineers .  
Many developing countries , in particular the least developed ones , still lack adequate scientific capacity , including a critical mass of qualified scientists in relevant disciplines .  
The right of disabled children to a full and decent life and to special care and the rights to abolition of traditional practices which are prejudicial to the health of children , such as early marriage , female genital mutilation , denial of equal sustenance and inheritance for girls are also highly relevant in the context of HIV / AIDS .  
In addition , during its session , the Governing Council considered reports submitted by a number of Governments on the distribution of compensation awarded to successful claimants in category B . The Council agreed that further discussion was needed regarding the situation where , following the transfer of funds to the relevant Governments or international organizations , awarded compensation has not been distributed to individual claimants , for one reason or another , after a reasonable period of time has elapsed . 
If , after the period for notification of the parties has elapsed , the court feels that it needs additional information in order to reach a decision , it shall convene an immediate oral hearing with the sole participation of the parties , at which it shall receive relevant evidence , hear statements by the parties or their lawyers and , immediately thereafter , issue a reasoned order declaring the extinction valid or invalid and , where appropriate , dismissing the proceedings .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
The report of the Special Rapporteur of the Sub _ Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , from which the relevant provisions of resolution 1995 / 34 derived , identified grave violations of human rights as involving the following : genocide , slavery , summary executions , torture , enforced disappearances , arbitrary and prolonged detention , deportation or forcible transfer of population or systematic discrimination .  
Data must be adequate , relevant and not excessive for the purpose for which they are held ; be accurate and for the registered purpose ; and surrounded by proper security .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
The idea of minimum humanitarian standards , formally born in Turku , Finland , presented , in his opinion , an attempt to integrate existing human rights and humanitarian norms into one set of principles relevant to situations of internal violence .  
We further call upon the international community and all its relevant institutions to meet their responsibility to halt these violations forthwith , to ensure the necessary protection for all missing persons , detainees and prisoners and to put an end to practices involving violence and threat of violence that have the basic purpose of spreading terror among the innocent civilian inhabitants of the area and uprooting them .  
We need to pursue these relevant Utopias and I believe the programme proposed by the 28 countries should be considered in the light of the present international context , but also within the expanding horizon of an international disarmament agenda which is intended to have a decisive impact on the status quo and advance even further the swing of the pendulum in the global security system . 
According to the information received , the situation of political and civil rights and fundamental freedoms has not improved : arbitrary arrests have taken place on a massive scale in Khartoum and other major towns in the north ; detention without due process was prevalent ; torture and degrading treatment was often reported ; freedom of association , assembly and movement were severely restricted and , where tolerated , tight government control was exercised , accompanied in most cases by the arbitrary acts of those in charge of the implementation of relevant government measures .  
Concerned about the limited availability of safe and cost-effective mine-detection and mine-clearance equipment as well as the lack of global coordination in research and development to improve the relevant technology , and conscious of the need to promote progress in this field and to foster international technical cooperation to this end ,  
The Assembly also appealed to Governments to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has intensified its technical cooperation activities to strengthen national capacities in the field of human rights education ; details of these activities at the national , regional and global levels are outlined in the relevant report of the Secretary-General to the Commission ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 86 ) .  
According to the relevant regulations , the Office shall be an autonomous constitutional body with legal capacity in public law and shall be responsible for protecting the constitutional and fundamental rights of individuals and the community and overseeing compliance by public authorities with their duties and the proper provision of public services to the citizenry .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Invites all Governments to further encourage and support all relevant actors of civil society , including the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Habitat Agenda by establishing effective partnerships and by creating an appropriate framework , in accordance with their respective national conditions , to further facilitate and expedite such actors in addressing human settlements issues , particularly servicing , finance mobilization , the provision of adequate shelter and related areas , and in that process to emphasize the need to integrate the gender perspective ;  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
Reaffirms the need for effective partnership and cooperation between Governments and the relevant actors of civil society , the social partners , the major groups as defined in Agenda 21 , [ 5 ] including non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the implementation of and follow-up to the Declaration and Programme of Action , and for ensuring their involvement in the planning , elaboration , implementation and evaluation of social policies at the national level ;  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to cooperate fully and in good faith in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;

Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
While the precise legal basis for such measures will need to be rooted in the text of each of the relevant treaties , the principal foundation is to be found in a teleological approach to interpretation which acknowledges that any other outcome is absurd in that it enables a delinquent State party to defeat the object and purpose of the implementation provisions .  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
A global spatial data infrastructure would include base cartographic and thematic data ( e.g . physical , environmental , socio-economic , infrastructure and other relevant spatial data ) .

The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .

Requests that all United Nations documentation be kept concise , clear , analytical and timely , with a focus on relevant issues , that to the greatest extent possible use be made of integrated reporting , that reports contain recommendations for action and indicate the actors involved , that reports be made available in all official languages in accordance with the rules of the United Nations , and that the use of other methods of reporting , such as oral reports , also be explored ;  
Reiterates that the main objective of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty is to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation in implementing fully and effectively the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments agreed upon at the United Nations major conferences and summits organized since 1990 as they relate to poverty eradication ;  
Mr . Al-Humaimidi ( Iraq ) , speaking in exercise of the right of reply , said that the comments made by the United States representative following the introduction of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iraq had been motivated by that countrys desire to prevent the lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq , despite Iraqs full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolution and contrary to the views of most members of the international community . 
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;

This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
The United Nations Security Coordinator formulates detailed recommendations aimed at ensuring the safety and security of staff members and eligible family members of the entire United Nations system , initiates discussions with representatives of agencies , political departments and other relevant offices in the Organization on current and potential security-related problems and is responsible for coordinating , planning and implementing inter-agency security and safety programmes and for acting as the focal point for inter-agency cooperation . 
This is achieved by analysing and understanding the key elements of international transactions , including the relevant elimination of constraints ; developing methods to facilitate transactions , including the relevant use of information technologies ; promoting both the use of these methods and associated best practices through channels such as governmental , industry and service associations ; coordinating and integrating the work under the subprogramme with other international organizations ; and securing coherence by cooperating with other interested parties in recognition that the work has broad application in the areas beyond global commerce .  
But most relevant to the theme of this most important international day of solidarity was the understanding expressed in the article that the rapid and sustained economic development we have experienced in Antigua and Barbuda is not a legacy of colonialism .  
In the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;  
Calls for the facilitation of access by all Non-Self-Governing Territories to relevant United Nations programmes whose objectives are the promotion of the social , educational , technical , environmental , cultural and economic well-being of the peoples of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to assist in the timely progression of the process of self-determination ;

The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .

The occupation of East Timor , systematically condemned by the relevant bodies of the United Nations , makes abusive and illegitimate any and all attempts to appropriate the genuine collective will of the Timorense People that does not pass through a free process of self-determination , approved by the relevant mechanisms and organs of the United Nations . The Secretary-General has been following with concern reports of recent violent incidents in East Timor which have resulted in loss of life and are causing considerable human suffering .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
The effective delivery assistance of relevant non-governmental organizations and volunteers in situations of complex emergencies should be further recognized as an important complementary part of the coordinated international , regional and subregional response and incorporated into the programming of actions .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .

What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
States , in cooperation with relevant international organizations , where appropriate , should not promote or allow the storage or disposal of high-level , intermediate-level or low-level radioactive wastes near the marine environment unless they determine that scientific evidence , consistent with the applicable internationally agreed principles and guidelines , shows that such storage or disposal poses no unacceptable risk to people or the marine environment and does not interfere with other legitimate uses of the sea .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .

The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
On the bilateral level , the Italian Government has established an ad hoc committee , composed of the relevant administrations involved in assistance to Albania and chaired by Commissioner Angioni , to coordinate all bilateral initiatives aimed at the social and economic recovery of the country , giving priority to public education , the health and judicial systems , the promotion of trade , and the fostering of small to medium-size businesses .  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , underlining the multidimensional , integrating and dynamic character of this right which favours a partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aiming at universal and effective respect for all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;

For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .

Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
They heard each member of the Council make comments and ask relevant and specific questions of the President of Rwanda , namely concerning the presence of forces of aggression on the Congolese territory , the permeability of common borders and the need to build a free , secure and democratic Rwandan society based on human rights , equality and respect for diversity .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
It is our conviction that the solution to the problems of the Democratic Republic of the Congo undoubtedly lies in the implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the additional protocols , as well as in the pertinent Security Council resolutions , which , once thoroughly observed , will provide the necessary conditions for a definitive settlement of the issues related to the illegal exploitation of the natural resources and other forms of wealth of the Congo in which the international community has a relevant role to play .  
In its agreed conclusions 2000 / 2 of 27 July 2000 , on the integrated and coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences , the Council invited its relevant functional commissions to consider a number of options listed in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General ( E / 2000 / 57 ) for enhancing the reviews of the major United Nations conferences and summits and to inform the Council for its consideration at its substantive session in 2001 of the outcome of their discussion .  
The Council therefore strongly encouraged Governments to pursue and strengthen their efforts to work towards achieving the goals of poverty eradication and reiterated the call for the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and the international community to take consistent , coherent , coordinated and joint action in support of national efforts to eradicate poverty , with particular attention to employment creation and work and the empowerment and advancement of women .  
In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
This report responds to relevant decisions taken by the Executive Board on the reports of the Executive Director to the Economic and Social Council over the past several years , in particular decision 1999 / 6 ( E / ICEF / 1999 / 7 / Rev . 1 ) , which requested the Executive Director to ensure that future reports to the Council advance the Boards wish for greater analytical effort , selected focus on key issues , problem-oriented reporting and discussions of lessons learned .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
On the basis of the foregoing and given all of these facts , the Government of the Republic of Iraq urges you to order a prompt inquiry , to be conducted by reliable medical and scientific authorities in cooperation with the relevant Iraqi scientific bodies , into the use of depleted uranium against Iraq and to expose such use as a direct cause of injury to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians and of damage to all aspects of the environment .  
The Secretary-General endorses the proposed formula for determining the number and salary levels of resident auditors that should be deployed to selected peacekeeping missions , on the understanding that the formula would be used as a guideline and the actual requirements in each case would be based on a detailed assessment of the related risks and other relevant factors .  
Following submission of the first part of the compilation to the Commission in 1996 , and at the request of the Commission and on the basis of the compilation , the Representative and the legal team , which included experts from international agencies and organizations whose mandates were directly relevant to the needs of the displaced , began to develop a comprehensive normative framework of protection and assistance for the internally displaced in the form of guiding principles on internal displacement . 
A final meeting , hosted by the Government of Austria in Vienna in January 1998 , widened the consultative process still further and included legal experts from the various geographic regions as well as representatives from a broad cross-section of relevant United Nations and other international agencies , regional organizations and NGOs . 
Though important steps were taken in accordance with the Programme for Reform to close this gap - the designation of the Emergency Relief Coordinator as the focal point for coordinating the international response to the assistance and protection needs of internally displaced persons , the designation of focal points on internally displaced persons in many of the relevant agencies and NGOs , and more regular discussion of issues of internal displacement in the IASC - the response to specific situations of internal displacement has remained ad hoc and still largely focused on assistance .  
The representative of Ukraine requested that the report of the Ad Hoc Committee reflect his view that the travaux prparatoires should indicate that the words state-to-state transactions and state transfers were included in article 4 , paragraph 2 , on the understanding that they included state-to-state transactions involving firearms and state transfers of firearms effected on the basis of relevant agreements concluded between the Governments of the States concerned or on behalf of those Governments by virtue of powers conferred by them .  
For each State or regional economic integration organization ratifying , accepting , approving or acceding to this Protocol after the deposit of the fortieth instrument of such action , this Protocol shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date of deposit by such State or organization of the relevant instrument or on the date this Protocol enters into force pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article , whichever is the later . 
It is pertinent to recall in this connection that in paragraphs 27 and 28 of his report dated 7 October 1998 on the first full year of the implementation of the reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment ( A / 53 / 465 ) , the Secretary-General indicated that the impact of the retroactive implementation of the new procedures could only be evaluated when all relevant claims had been processed for liquidated or liquidating missions and that the definitive comparison of the two systems was not available at that time .  
To that end , the international community must take the economic , social and cultural aspects of human rights into account by promoting and implementing the relevant international conventions so that they could have a real impact on those rights and on the improvement of the living conditions of all people .  
Algeria , which had always encouraged the international community to combat the scourge of terrorism in strict accordance with the principles of international law , had adopted national measures , acceded to relevant regional and international conventions and was trying to fully fit in with the frameworks of cooperation established at all levels .  
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
The Expert Seminar on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty identified the need for new guiding principles , which would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of extreme poverty , that clarified definitional issues within the framework of human rights and that set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
We stress the importance of a G-77 / G-8 dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership as an essential mechanism for the discussion of emerging and urgent issues relevant to the strengthening of a global partnership for development to further strengthen the efforts of the international community with respect to adopting a positive agenda and addressing development issues of international concern , including the implementation of the agreed commitments and outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits .  
The Committee recommends that the general principles of the Convention , in particular the provisions of its articles 2 , 3 and 12 , be appropriately integrated in all relevant legislation concerning children and applied in all political , judicial and administrative decisions and in projects , programmes and services which have an impact on all children , including non-citizen children , and guide the determination of policy-making at every level and actions taken by social and health welfare institutions , courts of law and administrative authorities .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

The Committee is concerned that the principles of non-discrimination ( art . 2 of the Convention ) , best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and respect for the views of the child ( art . 12 ) are not fully reflected in the State partys legislation and political , administrative and judicial decisions , as well as in its policies and programmes relevant to children both at the national and the local level .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) timely , reliable and relevant national statistics on economic and social areas will be made available , especially gender-sensitive statistics ; and ( b ) member States are fully committed to further enhancing the capacity of statistical staff on various statistical issues and packages presented by ESCWA , and to this end their full participation in training workshops conducted by ESCWA will be instrumental .  
Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
Monitoring the implementation of sustainable development goals through the assessment of data collected at the national , regional and international levels is one of the main objectives of the Division for Sustainable Development . 16 As decided by the Commission on Sustainable Development in 1993 , the Division invites Governments and organizations to submit the relevant information to the Commission . 
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
The transition to a child rights approach can be hampered by : conservative economic and social policies characterized by paternalism and political patronage ; the insufficient capacity of local-level bodies to assume the new responsibilities ; the continued application of archaic law regarding minors ; resistance to child rights concepts by executive , legislative and / or judicial officials ; and the absence of valid , timely and relevant data and indicators on the fulfilment and violation of rights .  
The basic consent provision is contained in article 246 , paragraphs 1 and 2 , whereby the coastal State in the exercise of its jurisdiction has the right to regulate , authorize and conduct marine scientific research in its exclusive economic zone and on its continental shelf in accordance with relevant provisions of the Convention .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
Reiterates its call upon all States and parties to the Peace Agreement to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms and effective , functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures consistent with the territorial integrity of all States in the region , within their internationally recognized borders , taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions ;  
Gravely concerned at the persistent violation by Israel of the principles of international law regarding the protection of human rights , in particular those contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , as well as the grave violation of the relevant provisions of international humanitarian law contained in the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto ,  
By its decision 1 / 1 , the Committee adopted , based on paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 54 / 196 , a substantive preliminary agenda for the financing for development process as contained in the annex to that decision , on the understanding that this preliminary agenda was of an indicative nature and would evolve during the substantive process ahead of the final event , through , inter alia , inputs from Member States , regional intergovernmental consultations and all relevant stakeholders .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
Its activities included raising awareness among families and communities of the rights of the child ; publicizing the relevant laws and instruments , such as the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child ; promoting the creation of nurseries , day-care centres , orphanages and welcoming centres ; supporting private initiatives for training and supervision during early childhood ; and taking charge of juvenile delinquents by re-educating them when they were in specialized institutions or in prison and by helping them with subsequent reintegration .  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out its revised mandate , which is to investigate cases of detention imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the relevant standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
Deplores the continued executions in the apparent absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards , in particular public and especially cruel executions , and urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to ensure that capital punishment will not be imposed for crimes other than the most serious and will not be pronounced in disregard of the obligations it has assumed under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the provisions of United Nations safeguards , and to provide the Special Representative with relevant statistics on this matter ;  
Reiterates its requests that the relevant special rapporteurs and the special mechanisms of the Commission undertake missions to the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation without delay and expresses serious concern that the thematic special rapporteurs or representatives on the question of torture , on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on internally displaced persons , who have requested to undertake visits have not yet received an answer and urges the Government of the Russian Federation to give favourable consideration to their requests as a matter of priority ;  
Urges the relevant authorities to take all necessary measures to avoid and limit the most cruel forms of corporal punishment in particular by applying alternative punishment and taking into account attenuating circumstances to the maximum extent possible provided for in national legislation and consistent with international human rights norms and standards ;  
Urges the Special Rapporteur to continue to undertake , in consultation with the relevant United Nations bodies and organizations and the secretariats of relevant international conventions , a global , multidisciplinary and comprehensive study of existing problems of and solutions to illicit traffic in and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes , in particular in developing countries , with a view to making concrete recommendations and proposals on adequate measures to control , reduce and eradicate these phenomena ;  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
It will also be important to receive proposals from CPF on streamlining national reporting formats required by various forest-related international organizations and instruments , taking also into account the streamlining work on reporting in other relevant forums . 13 UNFF may wish to focus on advancing the common understanding and use of those key concepts , definitions and terms that could benefit greatly the implementation at a practical level , as well as the monitoring of progress . 
In Economic and Social Council resolution 2000 / 35 , the Council decided to invite executive heads of relevant organizations of the United Nations system and heads of other relevant international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments to form a collaborative partnership on forests to support the work of UNFF and to enhance cooperation and coordination among participants , and facilitate and promote coordinated and cooperative action , including joint programming .  
Other relevant and interested international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments that are not members of CPF , including non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups , will be invited to contribute to specific activities of CPF , for example , certain projects , programmes , expert meetings and other activities , where their competencies would enrich the thematic work of CPF in the implementation of IPF / IFF proposals for action .  
The programme of work aims at the adoption and implementation of an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the right to development , a significant enhancement of support for that right from relevant United Nations bodies and a significant increase in the recognition of economic , social and cultural rights as human rights and their integration into the strategies and programmes of international organizations , agencies and financial and developmental institutions .  
The programme further aims at reinforcing the role of the United Nations as the unique worldwide forum for the discussion and resolution , with the participation of all relevant actors , of human rights matters of international concern , through its support for human rights bodies and organs and its adoption and progressive implementation of an improved treaty monitoring system , which deals with multiple reporting obligations and is based on a comprehensive national approach .  
Other areas of work that will receive special attention include : effective education and public information programmes ; strengthened contribution of non-governmental organizations , national institutions , grass-roots organizations and other relevant elements of civil society in United Nations human rights activities at all levels , according to the legislative mandates in effect regarding those issues ; effective human rights field activities and operations ; and support for the implementation of a strengthened system of special procedures based on harmonization and rationalization of work .  
The Working Group is composed of five independent experts with the task of investigating cases of detention imposed arbitrarily or otherwise inconsistently with the relevant international standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or in the relevant international legal instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
In this context , human resources directors meet prior to the sessions of the International Civil Service Commission to review matters under consideration by the Commission , appoint spokespersons to represent the executive heads of the participating organizations at the Commission sessions and put forward common positions on the relevant issues under consideration .  
The Hague Conference on Private International Law has recently undertaken the preparation of a fast track convention designed to create uniformity in the relevant conflicts rules and the European Unions draft directive on collateral also endorses a mix of substantive rules and rules of private international law .  
The Commission may therefore wish to request the Secretariat to undertake further study in close cooperation with international organizations specializing in relevant areas of law , such as Unidroit , the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the World Intellectual Property Organization , with a view to ascertaining whether and to what extent a uniform regime addressing those more specific types of assets would be desirable and feasible and which organizations should be involved in that work .  
Requests the independent expert to clarify further the proposed development compact , taking into consideration views expressed during the two sessions of the Working Group and in broad consultation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations funds and programmes , as well as specialized agencies , relevant international and regional organizations , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , those actors and States interested in developing pilot projects in this regard , keeping in mind :  
Requests the independent expert to prepare , in consultation with all relevant United Nations agencies and the Bretton Woods institutions , a preliminary study on the impact of these issues on the enjoyment of human rights , starting by analysing the existing efforts and means of assessing and evaluating such an impact , for consideration by the Working Group at its future sessions ;  
Urges the international community and the relevant United Nations bodies , in particular the United Nations Environment Programme and the secretariat for the Basel Convention , to continue to give appropriate support to the developing countries , upon their request , in their efforts to implement the provisions of existing international and regional instruments controlling the transboundary movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes in order to protect and promote the human rights to life and good health of all ;  
Alarmed by the reality of daily violations of childrens rights , including the right to life , to physical security and to freedom from arbitrary detention , torture and any form of exploitation , as well as economic , social and cultural rights , as laid out in relevant international instruments ,  
Encourages States to cooperate , including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance , in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the rights of the child and in the rehabilitation and social integration of the victims , such assistance and cooperation to be undertaken in consultation among concerned States and other relevant international organizations ; VIII .  
How to encourage all relevant national , regional and international policy-making forums to further pursue efforts to become more accountable , responsive and transparent to public concerns , as well as to review their composition and consultation mechanisms so as to ensure fuller and deeper participation of developing countries and adequate consultation with all concerned actor and stakeholder groups ?  
Encourage all relevant actors to intensify their efforts at the national , regional and international levels , especially by means of education , to ensure that children are educated from an early age in those values , attitudes and ways of conduct and life that will allow them to resolve conflicts of a racial or ethnic character peacefully , in a spirit of respect for human dignity , tolerance and non-discrimination ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and of illicit access to genetic resources , and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
The present report is based on the replies from 12 governmental agencies which were received by mid April 2001.1 A shorter version of the questionnaire was transmitted to relevant international organizations , specialized agencies and cooperative organizations ; 21 responses were received . 2 Respondents provided information on the action taken in the following areas : 
To implement and follow up the commitments undertaken pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration and to develop , adopt and implement effective domestic legislation , regulations and administrative measures to prevent , detect and combat , in cooperation with other States , domestic and transnational money-laundering , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , and using as a guideline the relevant initiatives of regional , interregional and multilateral organizations against money-laundering , the specific measures below are recommended .  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
They considered that the closest inter-agency collaboration in integrating ICT into the United Nations systems operations and in helping developing countries bridge the digital divide was essential for the system to remain effective and relevant in a rapidly changing global environment .  
Stresses the need for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , and requests the Secretary-General to make detailed recommendations in this regard to the Council within six months of the adoption of this resolution , which should be developed in close consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
In the relevant letters addressed to you on a regular basis by its Minister for Foreign Affairs , Iraq has always stressed that the logistic support provided to the Americans and British by Kuwait makes that country a partner in the aggression committed against Iraq and that it thus incurs international responsibility under international law , including liability for full compensation for the losses and damage , in both human and material terms , that are caused by this aggression .  
Requests the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions and other relevant multilateral institutions to take further concrete measures to systematically integrate the use of the modalities of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries into their regular cooperation programmes in line with the new directions strategy with a view to support their effective implementation ;  
Governments , with the assistance of relevant United Nations entities , needed to adopt a long-term , timely , coherent and integrated AIDS prevention policy , with public information , life skills-based education programmes specifically tailored to the needs of women and girls , adapted to their social cultural context and sensitivities and the specific needs in their life cycle .  
The development of an indigenous technological base will provide developing countries with the knowledge and skills necessary for the optimal use of their own human and natural resources and help in devising the production techniques relevant to their development strategies and cultural milieu .  
Takes note of the views of the Secretariat regarding the possibility of reviewing , subject to future experience , the procedures for settlement of liability for damages for major equipment used by one country and owned by another country , and decides that the liability for damage to major equipment used by one country and owned by another should be based on the relevant provisions of their memoranda of understanding in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the United Nations ;  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
In its resolution 1998 / 5 , the Sub-Commission decided , since the subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Marc Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept of affirmative action , and authorized him to request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to send out a questionnaire to Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations inviting them to send all relevant national documentation on affirmative action .  
By 2003 , ensure that national strategies , supported by regional and international strategies , are developed in close collaboration with the international community , including Governments and relevant intergovernmental organizations as well as with civil society and the business sector , to strengthen health care systems and address factors affecting the provision of HIV-related drugs , including anti-retroviral drugs , inter alia affordability and pricing , including differential pricing , and technical and health care systems capacity .  
In this context , encourage that the end results of these cooperative research findings and technologies be owned by all parties to the research , reflecting their relevant contribution and dependent upon their providing legal protection to such findings ; and affirm that all such research should be free from bias ;  
A salient feature of that programme was organizing periodic seminars / symposia to focus attention on specific issues falling within the framework of disarmament and development in the context of current international relations , as well as providing a forum where relevant United Nations bodies , non-governmental organizations and other international agencies could share their experience in areas of common or overlapping concerns .  
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
In this regard , it is important to introduce and , as applicable , to reinforce an / the anti-discrimination and anti-racism components / into human rights programmes in school curricula , to develop relevant educational material and to ensure that all teachers are effectively trained and adequately motivated to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns , etc .  / of the school curricula and to improve educational materials on human rights and anti-racism , in order to shape attitudes and behavioural patterns based on the principles of non-discrimination , mutual respect and tolerance ;  
Expressing its deep concern over the severity of humanitarian sufferings of affected civilian populations , the World Conference requests the relevant international institutions to continue rendering urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to populations expelled from their homes and calls for enabling refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes voluntarily , in safety and dignity ;  
[ Calls upon all relevant United Nations organs to endeavour to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel , together with all its racist practices , to an end , and to ensure the recognition of Jerusalem as a city of reverence and religious sanctity for the three major religions of the world which should serve as a focal point of historical and cultural inspiration , a symbol of civilization and religious dialogue and an epitome of tolerance and equality ] ;  
[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
These include the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions in volatile areas , the development , together with relevant regional organizations , of regional preventive strategies and the establishment of an informal network of eminent persons for conflict prevention .  
The fact that General Assembly resolution 55 / 5 stated that the reduction of the maximum assessment rate should have no automatic implication for the specialized agencies merely confirmed that the latter enjoyed financial autonomy and that , in the case of UNIDO , the resolution did not prevail over the relevant provisions of the UNIDO Constitution , which in Article 15.2 stated that the scale of assessments should be based to the extent possible on the scale most recently employed by the United Nations .  
It also continued to formulate and implement technical cooperation projects aimed at increasing the efficiency of external trade transactions in close cooperation with United Nations entities , regional commissions and other relevant international and professional organizations .  
This has involved providing policy advice on new trading opportunities and investment and research and technical assistance on economic sectors of particular interest to small island developing States , such as those relevant to the biodiversity and industries based on traditional knowledge and to international services .  
Recommends once again that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non-governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;
