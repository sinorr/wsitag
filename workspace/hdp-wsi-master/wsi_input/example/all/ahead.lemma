Marxism-Leninism and its creative development in China have fundamentally enhanced the spirit of the Chinese nation , greatly strengthened the historical initiative of the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to push forward China 's social development and make the great cause of ours to constantly forge ahead toward the lofty objectives along with the steps of the times .

Thus , the leadership changes at the ministerial and provincial governor level will be completed prior to the 16th party national congress .

Marxism-Leninism and its creative development in China have fundamentally enhanced the spirit of the Chinese nation , greatly strengthened the historical initiative of the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to push forward China 's social development and make the great cause of ours to constantly forge ahead toward the lofty objectives along with the steps of the times .
