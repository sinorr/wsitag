Assessment conducted last year for the 1998 triennial policy review on the formulation and implementation of the country strategy note and the preliminary assessment of the UNDAF process have shown that the essential precondition for the successful implementation of these instruments and thus of effective field-level coordination is well functioning , highly participatory and active country teams .  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .

His delegation believed that the social sector should be given high priority in the development process , since no economic development programme could be meaningful if it did not endeavour to eliminate hunger and illiteracy , provide adequate health services , improve the quality of life , and give due attention to human values .  22 .  The Government of Eritreas economic and social policies were based on the conviction that , to be successful , development must emphasize social development .  
Progress continues to be made in restoring basic public and social services and the authorities have expressed their expectation that the successful conclusion of the electoral process and the emergence of a new democratic government will lead to the disbursement of the funds pledged for Guinea-Bissau 's reconstruction efforts at the Round-table conference convened by UNDP in Geneva on 4 and 5 May 1999 .  
Armed conflict in the southern Sudan ruled out plans for the repatriation of refugees from Ethiopia and Uganda ; Somali refugees in Kenya were likewise unable to go back to their country of origin ; Sahrawi refugees continued to live in exile , waiting for a successful conclusion to negotiations on Western Sahara ; refugees from Burundi had to remain in the United Republic of Tanzania , where their presence was a major source of tension between the two States .  
Improving education and training in disaster reduction , including the creation of interdisciplinary and technical networking at all levels , through international assistance for the purpose of capacity-building and human resource development in developing countries , in particular those that are prone to natural disasters , is also necessary for the successful implementation of national programmes .  
Their successful conclusion on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions will benefit the peoples of the region including the people of Cyprus , who live with the vision of a free , united and peaceful island , without foreign troops and barbed wire and with its people integrated and cooperating as they did for centuries in the past . 
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously .

There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
While the active contribution of national authorities and the United Nations system was vital for a successful implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and the New Directions Strategy , the involvement of the private sector and of non-governmental organizations was indispensable in fostering a viable business sector in the developing countries .  
Acknowledging that United Nations electoral assistance has facilitated the holding of successful elections in several Member States , which has resulted in the orderly and non-violent assumption of office by elected officials , recognizing that elections can be free and fair only if the secrecy of the ballot is protected and elections are held free of coercion and intimidation , and underlining the importance of respect for the results of elections that have been verified as free and fair ,  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
Moreover , the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects typically requires various measures beyond the establishment of an appropriate legislative framework , such as adequate administrative structures and practices , organizational capability , technical expertise , appropriate human and financial resources and economic stability .  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant public authority conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
We also look forward to the successful conduct of the planned upcoming municipal elections in Kosovo , which will lay a viable foundation for the future .  
It shared the view that the successful implementation of the integrated programmes was dependent on substantial voluntary funding and supported UNIDOs intention to attract financial resources from , inter alia , UNDP and the private sector .

Deeply concerned that , despite many successful international and regional environmental agreements , and some progress having been achieved , environmental damage caused by illegal traffic in endangered species and dangerous and harmful substances and products is growing ,  
Likewise , the political support of the United Nations in this case , the Security Council and the provision of material and technical assistance by the international community are essential for the successful implementation of the ECOWAS initiative to deploy a multinational ECOWAS Monitoring Group force along the borders of Guinea , Liberia and Sierra Leone .  
In conclusion , we hope that todays very broad discussion with the family of United Nations organs and agencies , relevant institutions and Member States will be a step forward to the successful implementation of a fully integrated and broad-based subregional approach aimed at addressing the multifaceted problems confronting the region and promoting durable peace and sustainable development in West Africa .

Few recipient countries have established effective focal coordination points for technical cooperation and the few that have done so have only been partially successful in moderating the competing interests of various ministries , departments and non-governmental agencies , many of which often compete for the same resources from the same limited pool of international technical assistance donors and providers .  
The action taken in response to that trend included the following : renewed support for law enforcement authorities in combating synthetic drugs ; the establishment of joint agency units ; specialist training for customs and police officials ; increased support for demand reduction programmes directed against ATS ; and further strengthening of treaties of mutual legal assistance to ensure successful investigation and prosecution of those engaged in such criminal activity .

Also urge them to recognize that the art and technology of developing multiracial and multicultural societies and the positive example of successful multiracial societies such as some of those in the Caribbean need to be systematically studied , and therefore request the United Nations to consider establishing an international centre for multiracial studies and policy development to undertake this critical work ;  
Welcomes the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the pilot project on the development of an international radio broadcasting capacity for the United Nations , [ 12 ] and also welcomes the extensive network of partnerships established with local , regional and national broadcasters in Member States , and concurs with the Secretary-General that the implementation of the project has been one of the more successful examples of the reorientation of the Department of Public Information ;

Taking into account that the Special Unit for TCDC is understaffed and underfunded , it must be selective in its activities , which should include : improving knowledge of all TCDC programmes worldwide ; highlighting and exchanging successful and unsuccessful development experiments ; increasing research cooperation ; developing knowledge platforms in priority areas , including increasing the usefulness of WIDE ; developing new criteria for the selection of initiatives to be supported ; and increasing the participation of new actors , e.g . , the private sector , social sector , and foundations .  
Regrets that despite section V , paragraph 19 , of its resolution 53 / 221 and according to paragraph 52 of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat on the follow-up audit of the recruitment process in the Office of Human Resources Management , [ 5 ] some programme managers are still reluctant to recruit candidates selected through national competitive examinations , leaving many P-2 posts vacant , and requests the Secretary-General to take concrete measures to fill those posts expeditiously from the existing roster of successful candidates ;

The General Assembly may also wish to take note of the decision adopted by the Council of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) at its last meeting recognizing fully that the issue of land degradation is integral to the pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and synergies among the global environmental conventions and deciding to designate land degradation ( desertification and deforestation ) as a GEF focal area as a means for enhancing GEF support for the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .  
It also urges them to recognize that the art and technology of developing multiracial and multicultural societies and the positive example of successful multiracial societies such as some of those in the Caribbean region need to be systematically studied , and therefore requests the United Nations to consider establishing an international centre for multiracial and multicultural studies and policy development to undertake this critical work ;

Slovakia fully supported the continuation of UNIDOs successful transformation in order to increase the impact , relevance and usefulness of the Organization in its task of promoting responsible and sustainable industrial development , as a means of achieving economic well-being and social development while ensuring environmental sustainability .  
UNIDO should systematize successful experiences and models of sustainable industrial development , taking account of the specific conditions in each country , so that strategic alliances with other international or regional bodies could be established .  
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
It is at that level that , most immediately , priorities can be identified , successful and flexible response strategies determined ( including through international cooperation ) and assistance given to States , in the human rights context and within the international and regional human rights frameworks .  
The Syrian Arab Republic advocates transparency in armaments as a means of enhancing international peace and security and believes that , in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain well-defined basic principles : it must be balanced , comprehensive and non-discriminatory , and it must enhance the national , regional and international security of all States in conformity with international law .  
However , the actual benefits may be quite limited as the delivery of the main components of debt relief packages , including debt stock reduction from the Paris Club , remains conditional on the finalization and successful implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSPs ) , which set out the countrys macroeconomic and structural reform policies , as well as concrete poverty-reduction goals .  
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
The practice is nevertheless being continued ; for example , a competitive examination for English interpreters capable of working from Russian is planned for early 2002 for the candidates being trained in-house in the autumn as well as for other applicants ; an examination for English translators capable of translating from Arabic will be given in February 2002 , and a similar examination for French translators may also be held in 2002 if the competitive examination scheduled for September 2001 does not produce a significant number of successful candidates proficient in Arabic .  
Least developed countries agreed to support initiatives that help empower people living in poverty , build on successful policy reforms and continuing efforts towards sound economic management with a view to attaining levels of economic growth necessary for reaching the objectives of the Programme of Action , and promote an equitable distribution of the benefits of growth and development in favour of the poor and improve their access to basic social services with a view to increasing their opportunities for participation in economic activity .  
The Programme of Action acknowledged that successful implementation of the objectives , policies , commitments and measures contained in the Programme of Action would require , at the national level , among other things , that these be supported by good governance through transparent , accountable , and efficient institutions and practices within the Government , the private sector and civil society .
