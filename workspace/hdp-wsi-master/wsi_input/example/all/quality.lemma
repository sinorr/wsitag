Although this is an extreme case in a tiny minority , it is sufficient to show : Reducing the heavy academic burden on students and fostering their fine psychological quality and legal concepts are a pressing task .  
Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
Therefore , the motherland has continued to implement the policy of reform and opening up and economic development , enhanced its comprehensive national strength , continued to raise the quality of the people 's life , promoted forward development of cross-strait interactive relations , and strengthened the Chinese people 's cohesive force , thereby playing an active role in peaceful reunification of the motherland .

Their ideological and political quality , work style , words and deeds have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies in rural areas , on the reform , development and stability in rural areas , and on the relations between the party and the masses and between the cadres and the masses .  Generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ;  
If the departments concerned can work in close cooperation , coordinate their actions and produce some tangible results in these activities , it will be conducive to promoting the solution of major and difficult issues that the masses feel very strongly about , thus making the effects of ideological and political work felt deep in the heart of the masses , improving the quality of the population as civilized people , and making the urban and rural areas more civilized .  
Reviewing 1999 , many deputies and committee members were not only proud that China 's economy has continued to record steady growth and is regarded by the world as one of the liveliest countries , but were also extremely glad that the quality of economic operations has improved during a painful and arduous switch of track .

In line with the current situation and tasks as well as the ideological reality of officers and men , by encouraging officers and men to study , analyze , and discuss theories and to compare and examine themselves with positive examples , this unit has drawn up measures to conduct rectification and correction and concentrated on enhancing officers and men 's sense of responsibility and mission in preparing for military combat with high standards and high quality .

However , entry into the international market was not something that could be accomplished in one move .  To reach the technical standards for product quality in various countries , China 's household electrical appliance enterprises persisted in producing high-quality products in compliance with internationalized standards to obtain international certification under the system of product quality assurance by numerous exporting countries , thus completing the first step they must take in entering the international market , securing the " pass " to the international market , and opening up an international passageway .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .

Jiang Zemin pointed out that positively pushing forward the strategic economic structural adjustment is a fundamental measure to give impetus to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and elevate the quality and efficiency of the economic growth .

He said : During the past 20 years , the economic exchange and trade cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan have steadily developed and continuously grown in quality and quantity , and the contacts of people and activities of social and cultural intercourse have been increasingly frequent , thus initially forming a pattern of mutual complementarity , mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development of the economies of the two localities .  
Over more than 20 years of reform and opening up , great development has been made in the rural economy of our country , but the gross economic quantity is still not big enough , and the quality is not high enough .  The current economic conditions still can not satisfy the ever increasing material and cultural needs of the vast number of peasants in their day-to-day lives .  
Deputy Wang Zhihao is deputy regimental commander of an air force aviation unit with glorious traditions .  This 34 year-old lieutenant colonel , who has been flying for 15 years , stressed : " As a result of training through science and technology in recent years , the overall quality of the air force has been greatly enhanced , while ideological and political education over a long period has rooted in our minds the idea that ' the interests of the motherland and the people are forever supreme . '  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
Zeng Peiyan suggested : We should devote major efforts to advancing education for improving the overall quality of students ; accelerating the fostering of qualified personnel ; deepening structural reform in the fields of science , technology , and education ; strengthening technological innovation ; developing high technology ; achieving industrialization ; accelerating the establishment of a state innovation system ; nurturing enterprises into a genuine mainstay in technological innovation ; and making science , technology , and education serve economic construction even better .  
Now that Guangdong has built up considerable economic strength , how should it grasp the new opportunity and improve its overall economic quality through positive involvement in full-fledged competition in the international market on the basis of consolidating and developing the existing economy is a new task .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .

In recent years , China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense has attained achievements of world interest , and a great headway has been registered in the development and production quality of key weapons models .  Particularly , the successful launching of satellites , the successful completion of the National Day parade , and the successful launching of the " Shenzhou " experimental spacecraft have greatly inspired the spirit of the nation , and have enhanced the prestige of our country and our army .  
In his report , Xu Penghang stressed the need to proceed the work from the survival of China 's scientific and technological industry for national defense , and from the overall situation of the country 's national defense building ; enhance to a new level the work of guaranteeing both the quality and the reliability of national defense-related scientific research and production ; and make new contributions to improving the quality of the scientific and technological industry for national defense , and to making true the national defense modernization of our country .  
Knowledge and qualified personnel , national quality , and innovation capability have increasingly become important indicators of comprehensive national capability and critical factors of advancing or constraining economic growth and social development .  
To accelerate the achievement of national modernization , to strengthen comprehensive national capability and international competitiveness , and to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the new century , it is imperative to earnestly implement the CPC 's education policy , to vigorously develop education , to comprehensively advance personal quality education , and to promote the comprehensive development of children and youths , in an effort to train high quality workers and specialized personnel of various levels and fields meeting the requirements of modernization construction .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .  
Beijing has become not only the largest education base nationwide , but also a renowned international education center in the Asia-Pacific region , thereby laying a good foundation for deepening education reform and comprehensively carrying out personal quality education .  
However , the capital city 's education still has many problems which urgently need to be resolved : there remains a prominent contradiction between the growing education needs of the masses of the people and education 's insufficient supply in quantitative terms and low quality ;  
It is necessary , on the basis of centering on personal quality education , to intensify the reform of the school-running system and to encourage social forces to operate schools , so as to meet the need of economic development and comprehensive social progress for diverse personnel and to meet needs of the capital city 's reform , opening , and modernization construction .

Article 24 In places where industrial wastewater and urban sewage are used for irrigation , the agricultural authority of local people 's governments at or above the county level shall organize regular monitoring of the quality of water used for irrigation and the irrigated soil and farm produce and shall take appropriate measures to prevent the pollution of soil , underground water , and farm produce .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
He stressed the need to conscientiously study and comprehensively understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's recent important speech on strengthening and improving the educational work , and implement his instructions in routine work .  School education , family education , and social education should be properly combined .  With the joint efforts of all parties concerned , a benign atmosphere for quality education should be created in society , and more favorable environment and conditions be created for youngsters ' healthy growth .  
To a certain extent , Putin 's victory is also related to his personal quality .  In Russians , he has left the impressions of a person who " is steady , " " does solid work , " " has an iron hand , " " is healthy , " and " is bold but cautious . "  His election as president of the new century by the common people showed that the common people have great expectations for him , and hope he will lead Russia to a prosperous , stable , and strong tomorrow .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .  Tourism is playing a more and more important role in the national economy , and is producing positive influence for the enhancement of national quality and the development of the socialist spiritual civilization .  
It is necessary to proceed on the basis of resolving currently prominent problems and to have in mind long-term development ; it is necessary to vigorously proceed with the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , to further stabilize and enhance agriculture 's position as the base , to intensify the adjustment of the industrial structure , and to accelerate the grand development of the western region , so as to improve the overall quality of the national economy and to raise the economy to a higher level .  
In order to ensure stringent and impartial law enforcement and prevent power abuse , the public security organs at various levels have also persistently and unremittingly addressed in a focused way such problems as misuse of coercive measures , extended custody , extortion of confession by torture , arbitrary imposition of fines , and arbitrary collection of fees .  As a result , the law-enforcement work of the public security community has become more regularized and the quality of law enforcement has improved rather significantly .  
The second-worst quality variety is the corn in the northeast .  There is an idiom that says , " grow on the fire , harvest on the ice . "  It means , the time to harvest the corn is when it is frozen to death .  The corn is not completely mature .  The frozen kernel is tough and contains a lot of water .  But if you roast it , the kernel becomes flat and dry .  
It is not just in agriculture .  Improving agricultural quality and raising the quality of farming products is based on the attitude of national economic smoothness and lasting development .  Improving farmers ' income is the basic difference from the past .  
The targets for controlling COD , nitrogen , phosphorus , and petroleum should comprehensively attain the requirements for controlling the volume and the total amount of pollutants ; the water quality of near-shore water areas should comprehensively attain the defined environmental protection targets in areas according to their functions .  The ecology should basically realize a benign cycle , and the environment of a number of key sea areas should be comprehensively improved .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
Luo Dahua , professor of psychology of China Politics and Law University , said : In foreign countries , the main purpose of their psychologists ' visits to prisons is to cure criminals with fairly evident psychological disease , but in China , our psychological treatment for criminals is aimed at transforming them in line with the criminals ' personal characteristics and raising the psychological quality of the entire group of prisoners .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Under the present circumstances wherein the contradiction between pastures and livestock has proved a predominant problem in a majority of pastoral areas in the region , we should no longer follow the old development road of a quantity expansion .  Instead , we must make up our mind to increase the intensity of changing the growth pattern of the economy ; and lay the stress of the region 's development of animal husbandry on improving breeds , upgrading pastures , enhancing quality , and boosting economic efficiency .  
An authoritative person analyzed the situation when he was interviewed by reporters and noted that the driving forces included mainly the following : The showing of the effectiveness of the policy of macro-control , the increase of demand for export as a result of the recovery of the global economy , the significant improvement of quality in industrial production , the new motive force as a result of the rapid development of new and high-tech industries , and the " popular feeling " that expect good economic growth .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
should reform the course structures and examination and appraisal systems to integrate the easing of the students ' excessive burdens with the improvement of the quality of education and teaching as well as the cultivation of the students ' indomitable will and spirit of assiduous study ; and should make sure they achieve , within this year as scheduled , the " two basic " goals of basically popularizing the nine-year compulsory education and basically eliminating illiteracy among people in their youth and the prime of life .  
Comrade Mao Zedong said during the rectification campaign in Yanan : Only when we master Marxism can our contingent be consolidated , can our cadres be enhanced in quality , and can we have the ability to meet and to have control over a future bright world .  
The extensive application of high technology has enhanced weapons ' accuracy and lethality , and enabled the soft equipment to withstand dual attack - - the " hard attack " and the " soft killing . "  The accelerated loss rate needs the supplement of network technology and strength not only with high quality but also at a high speed .  
Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
The most important things ahead of logistics units at present are as follows : 1 ) The unified logistics units at various levels should have a sense of urgency , strive to upgrade the quality of commanding modern wars , strengthen the building of information networks , and set up as quickly as possible a swift , sensitive , and high-efficiency commanding system .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
To strengthen the awareness of leaders at all levels in leading troops in war , the group army has promoted innovations centered on existing equipment , explored the battle method of winning against the enemy 's superiority under an unfavorable situation ; mastered automated field operation command ; enhanced comprehensive quality of officers and men ;  
As the new model aircraft had very powerful mechanical functions and was installed with video camera and laser display equipment , it was capable of appraising the tactics and firepower response of the artillery unit .  It also had the function of simulated missile launch , thereby creating conditions for raising the quality of training in " three attacks and three defenses . "  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
The general goal of relying on regular higher education to train military cadres is , in line with the principle of formulating overall plans , making steady progress , and ensuring quality , to adopt various measures to encourage and attract students of regular schools of higher learning to work in the military after graduation and to establish systems and formulate and improve policies and rules to gradually increase the number of students selected to receive the training and improve the training quality so to secure stable and reliable sources of high-quality personnel for the military .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
In addition to encouraging the large-scale introduction of foreign capital , China has put a fair amount of emphasis all along on the quality of the utilization of foreign capital , laying out clearly the guiding policies for the active , reasonable , and effective utilization of foreign capital .  
Accordingly , to adapt to the changing circumstances and promote the long-term dynamic stability in our international balance of payments , as well as safeguarding national economic security and the interests of foreign investors , we must concentrate hard on the key issue of improving the quality of utilization of foreign capital .  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
When the soldiers ran down the hill , they were already wet and exhausted .  As soon as the exercise ended , cadres of the company promptly exhorted the soldiers that the new equipment training was aimed at testing the comprehensive military quality of soldiers .  They said that even though they had four-wheeled armored vehicles , they still needed to train their two legs , and that only when the strong skills were maintained and new skills were not weak could they realize a new leap in combat strength .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
The Bayi Men 's Basketball Team has defeated its competitors in consecutive games and has won games one after the other because the team - consistently aiming for first-class quality in their play is consistent and strict in managing the team , applies scientific theories to training , constantly perfecting the skills of every player , does not consider losses for and gains to individuals and relies on teamwork for victories .  Unity leads to combat strength and industrious training leads to excellent soldiers .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .  For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
The people are now seeking the enhancement of their life quality after they achieved quantitative satisfaction .  The broad masses have truly feel the great superiority of socialism from their personal experience in the great enhancement of their own living standards , and support socialism from the bottom of their hearts .  Socialism has won an extensive and profound mass foundation in China .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
We must make bold explorations , and have the courage to carry out implementation in such aspects as the policy system , the organizational mechanism , incentive measures , and means for ensuring a sufficient logistical supply , and constantly enhance the vigor of the military work .  In our innovation of the methods of operation , methods of training , and methods of management , we should set our eyes on improving the quality of our military ;  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
The broad policies and specific principles for reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty have been clearly laid down by the central authorities and all major policy measures have been promulgated .  The key now is to continue the effort to implement them properly in accordance with the central authorities ' plan .  It is necessary to harmonize speed with efficiency , scale with structure , and quantity with quality , putting quality improvement and efficiency enhancement first ;  
Supervision and management should be strengthened and landmark projects for technological transformation should be accomplished as scheduled .  Technological transformation must center on variety , quality , efficiency , and expansion of export .  High and new technology and advanced , applicable technology should be used to transform a batch of key enterprises in the important industries to develop products that enjoy competitive advantages and to stem redundant development in an effective way .  
The scale of these building activities is large , and they have broad impact .  They have raised the level of civilization in the cities and the ethical quality of the citizens and played a positive promotional role for the stability of reform and development .  
At the same time , in the roadway development for the western region , we must put intense emphasis on ecological and environmental protection and management , protecting cultivated lands , economizing on land use , and industriously integrating roadway development with the improvement of the surrounding environment .  We do this in order to improve the ecology and environment of the west , and to contribute to the enhancement of environmental quality .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
We should put the improvement of quality and enhancement of economic result high on the agenda .  Guided by the market , we should make active efforts to push forward the structural adjustment , do a good job in controlling total supply and total demand , resolutely eliminate enterprises with inferior production capability , and avoid making the same mistake of duplicating construction projects .  We should integrate the periodical goal with the long-term goal of carrying out the reform and development of state-owned enterprises .  
The evaluation of authoritative figures regarding all this is that the quality of economic growth has improved somewhat , the various relationships are more harmonious , production and consumption have developed together , and macro and micro are increasing in parallel .  
By grasping overall and key problems related to the comprehensive building of the grassroots party organizations , we can truly resolve problems in the grassroots party organizations that are of the nature of trends , ensure the effects and quality of " three stresses " education , and successfully achieve marked ideological improvement , marked political progress , marked transformation of work style , marked strengthening of discipline , marked progress in work , marked changes in quality , marked strengthening of the fortress role , and marked improvement in relations between officers and men .  
In October 1978 , the central government convened the third national people 's defense work conference , determined the people 's air defense principle of " making overall planning , giving play to major points , integrating peacetime and wartime efforts , and putting quality first , " thus entering a stage in the people 's air defense work that stressed comprehensive and coordinated development , quality , and combining peacetime and wartime efforts .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
Every communist , especially the leading cadres , must take warning from this , and truly succeed in being completely upright and uncorrupted , resist the lure of power , money , and sex with noble communist uprightness , and uphold and carry forward the quality and demeanor of communists .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
Therefore , it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the work of controlling the political and ideological conditions of the cadres .  In particular , it is necessary to set up concrete procedures and work out concrete standards and methods for assessing the political and ideological quality of a cadre .  The conclusion of the assessment should also be more specific and detailed .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
Guangzhou Military Area Command devoted firm and resolute effort to formulating fighting strength and logistic supply abilities on the basis of military units as a whole .  This measure focused on the crucial point in the current construction of fighting strength throughout the military .  It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria .  
Designated as the " blue army " in a combined tactical training base , a certain armored brigade of the Beijing Military Region has conducted confrontation exercises with several " red army " divisions and brigades in succession , thus playing an important role in inspecting the military region 's achievements in training with science and technology and raising the quality of the training .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
In the past five years , this country that is in the midst of advancing socialist modernization not only reined in the unbridled horse of inflation , but also curbed the trend of deflation .  China accomplished the unusual feat of yearly economic growth of eight percent accompanied by improvement of quality and efficiency of economic growth .  
In recent years , following its sustained economic growth , India has become more eager to have its position as a big country recognized .  Therefore , it has continuously increased its national defense budget ( The 2000-2001 national defense budget increased by as much as 28.2 percent . ) and strengthened its military strength in quantity and quality .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
We will selectively support a group of backbone enterprises in the energy , metallurgy , chemical , light , textile , machinery , automobile , building materials , and construction industries in their efforts to carry out technical transformation and improve the standards of their technology and equipment while working around the goals of increasing product varieties , improving quality , conserving energy , preventing and controlling pollution , expanding exports , and improving labor productivity .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
The reporter has learned that these units that were evaluated as tops in training have several clear features : Their major military and political officers are all outstanding commanders , having top overall comprehensive quality , and very strong command and control training ability .  
These leaders should pay attention to study characteristics of these units , meticulously review positive experiences drawn from practice , and enthusiastically explore new issues and new problems that arise in the condition of reforming , opening up and developing a socialist market economy .  These leaders should closely associate the essence of the five-sentence general requirement and the " Program " with the reality of these " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units , work in a creative manner and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of our work .  
During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .  This made many talented people reluctant to serve in the armed forces , and various armed forces personnel in key positions to decide against making it a career .  This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .  Cadres should utilize a wartime work style , revolutionary spirit and be fully dedicated to their career to inspire themselves .  As long as they can , they will be struggling for the interests of the Party , the country and the people wholeheartedly and carrying out our military 's sacred mission , as dictated by the times , to the highest standards and to the highest level of quality .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
According to the long-range goal put forth at the 15th Party Congress , our country will scale a new height in economic and social development during the 10th five-year period .  The goal is : Maintaining a relatively rapid development pace in the national economy , achieving notable results in strategic economic restructuring , and significantly improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth , thereby laying a strong foundation for the GDP in 2010 to double that of 2000 ;  
Military cadres at divisional and regimental rank , as the crucial and important motors of military construction , have lived through tests as leaders , accumulated rich experiences in being leaders .  They are loyal to the Party , have a strong sense of professionalism and responsibility , and possess a high , comprehensive quality : of theory , of innovation and discipline .  
The vast majority of these comrades are young in age , good in political quality , highly educated , possessing of strong professional ability , broadminded , ideologically emancipated , highly conscious of reform , and down-to-earth in style of work .  
The latest statistics show that China continues to be in front rank of the world in the amount of foreign capital used but , in light of the national condition that we have a vast territory but a dense population and there is a wide economic gap between regions , the use of foreign capital still needs to be expanded and its quality improved .  
As a result , there is a more reliable guarantee for the resource of funds to pay the interests of treasury bonds .  Particularly , with the expansion of China 's economic aggregates , the increase of the quality of economic growth , and further deepening of its financial and taxation systems , China has increasingly strengthened its financial ability to pay back its debts .  The state has an absolute ability to pay back its matured treasury bonds without causing a debt crisis .  
First , the reorganization and transformation of traditional industries should be put in an important position .  Traditional industries should be optimized and upgraded by means of quickening the change in the mode of industrial growth , increasing product variety , improving product quality , lowering energy consumption and other costs , adopting high and new technologies and other advanced and applicable technologies .  Second , it is necessary to develop high and new technology industries .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
In order to actively meet the requirements of the new situation and tasks and earnestly master features and laws , on the basis of making sufficient study and argumentation , the Central Military Commission and PLA General Departments have staged a series of new policies and regulations focusing on improving educational quality , conducting troop training in science and technology , strengthening the cultivation of cadres , implementing socialized safeguards , improving the work style of leaders , and so on .  
Through the practice of 10 years , the whole army from top to bottom has formed such an understanding : To fulfill the general requirements of the " five phrases " , it is imperative to advance together with the times , regard " winning the battles " and " having no degeneration in quality " as the objectives and the improvement of the overall quality of officers and soldiers as a focal point , make unremitting efforts in laying foundations , and strive to initiate a new situation for the building of grass-roots units of our army .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
The meeting held : By successfully exploring a comprehensive way with Chinese characteristics for controlling the number of population and raising the quality of people , China has attracted worldwide attention on its achievements in population and family planning .  However , the country continues to face an enormous and arduous task in stabilizing law birth rates , and problems and difficulties in carrying out family planning work .  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
After our WTO entry , with the gradual completion of relevant policies and regulations as well as gradual improvements in the investment environment , we may be able to attract more foreign capital , new agricultural technology , superior varieties and management experience through the international market to improve our agricultural infrastructure , to heighten the level of our agricultural technology and modernized management , to improve the quality and output of our agricultural products , and to enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products on the international market .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
The meeting held : By successfully exploring a comprehensive way with Chinese characteristics for controlling the number of population and raising the quality of people , China has attracted worldwide attention on its achievements in population and family planning .  However , the country continues to face an enormous and arduous task in stabilizing law birth rates , and problems and difficulties in carrying out family planning work .  
It is necessary to transform work style , practice the leadership accountability system , ensure that all work measures are in place , and gain new and marked achievements in public order work ; we must succeed in markedly lowering the crime rate , improving the public order precautionary setup , further strengthening the masses ' sense of security , markedly improving the all-round quality of the political-legal contingent , and achieving a big improvement in judicial backup work .

Meanwhile , the city should also vigorously improve its investment environment , enhance both the quality and efficiency of its foreign fund utilization , and gradually meet the requirement of ensuring a simultaneous growth between its introduction of capital and its introduction of advanced technologies , modern management concepts , and people with professional skills .  
Li Lanqing pointed out : Although the objectives of the state-owned enterprises ' ridding themselves of difficulties within three years have been basically achieved yet , taken as a whole , a considerable gap still exists in such areas as changing concept , carrying out reform and innovation , making technological progress , protecting environment , intensifying management , raising quality , and catching up with and surpassing the world 's advanced levels .  
Li Lanqing stressed : All enterprises must , on the one hand , have their eyes on the outside world , keeping abreast of the development trend of the advanced enterprises at home and abroad , and on the other hands , have their eyes on our own country , finding out the gaps , getting to know our deficiencies , and expediting institutional innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and management innovation around the enhancement of enterprises ' quality and competitiveness .  
However , because of the poor quality of the pilots of the communist troops , it was impossible for them to understand more difficult tactics .  Therefore , the communist troops developed a set of pithy formula , which the pilots recited whenever they were followed by a rattlesnake missile .  After reciting the formula , they turned a sharp angle to try to shake off the missile .  
We must conscientiously implement the principle of " sticking to set standards , guaranteeing quality , improving the structure , and recruiting party members with caution , " strictly go through the procedures for admission to the party ; admit a party member only after he is qualified to be admitted ; and recruit into the party only those outstanding elements in new social classes who recognize the party 's program and constitution , consciously fight for the party 's line and program , have withstood long-term tests , and can meet the requirements of party members .

Beijing 's annual average volume of utilizable water resources is about 4.1 billion cubic meters .  Judging from the existing facilities and management level , this does not come up to the requirements for turning Beijing into an international metropolis and a city with first-rate environmental quality .  
As an important measure for structural readjustment , the Chinese government has canceled the protective prices of poor-quality-seed grain , such as southern early rice and northern spring wheat , encouraged the production of marketable , good-quality-seed produce , and increased the purchase-price difference according to quality .  
This year localities and departments will continue to pay close attention to state-owned enterprise reform , economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and internal demand expansion in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and strive to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy while further improving the quality of economic operation .  
The extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .  How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?

In agricultural production , on the basis of protecting the production capability of grain and other essential agricultural products , stress should be put on the optimization of varieties and the enhancement of quality and efficiency with a view to comprehensively optimizing crop varieties , painstakingly raising the quality of agricultural produce , positively developing animal husbandry and aquaculture , heightening the added value transformed from the processing of agricultural produce , and repeatedly increasing peasants ' income .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
Jiang Ying says that : In a short dozen years or so , in the area of patent legislation , examination , and institution building , China has done what took the developed nations decades or even a century to do , to the focus of world attention .  But since " our ability and quality in grasping and using patents remains inadequate , in contrast to the developed nations , we remain subject to a sizeable gap . "  
The main method to be used for this task is adopt sound environmental protection standards and technical norms and , based on these standards and norms , build a protective wall to ensure environmental protection and technological quality .

In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
It should actively propagate , popularize and promote advanced ideology and culture among the masses and develop a scientific , civilized and progressive ideological concept , way of production and way of life .  It should constantly enhance ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural level of the whole nation and become the disseminator of China 's advanced culture .  
She indicated that real strength is the key in participating in international competition , and that improving real strength , such as developing industrial and agricultural product quality , invariably relies on science and technology .  
The main problems are : In some localities , the policy of unlimitedly purchasing peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices and quality grain at better prices has not been completely carried out , there are phenomena of restricting or refusing purchases and purchases by lowering the grade and reducing the price , and the continued decline of grain market prices has decreased peasants ' profits in growing grain and dampened their enthusiasm to a certain extent .  
The developed coastal areas and suburban districts of large and medium cities should proceed from their local superiority and give priority to the development of agriculture with fine quality and high efficiency as well as agriculture that earns foreign exchange .  
They have made positive contributions to controlling excessive population growth , improving population quality , and bringing population growth into line with economic , social , resource , and environmental development .  
refines and summarizes anew the Marxist points on the communist party 's advanced nature ; unveils the substance and implication of the communist party 's advanced nature from the high plane of the law of social development as well as the communist party 's intrinsic progressive quality .  In his exposition , Jiang Zemin makes it clear that : only when the party clearly understands the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations , firmly acting as the representative of the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces ;  
Over the past five years since the convocation of its third national congress , the Young Pioneers has closely centered its work around the overall work of the party and the state ; launched a series of varied and colorful activities in the light of the development demands of our time , including the activity of " hand in hand " and the " Operation Eyas of the Chinese Children " ; and has done a great deal of fruitful work in ensuring a healthy growth of children and enhancing the comprehensive quality of children .  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
Our current uncoordinated grain production and marketing structure is a very glaring problem , with a shortage of quality varieties , a surplus of popular and dependable varieties , a lack of adaptation to market demand , and the inability to sell at good prices being the key reasons for the grain selling difficulties and for peasants producing more but earning less .  
Through structural adjustment , we need to improve grain production in both breadth and depth , to convert from common varieties to quality and exclusive varieties , from the single production of grain to the overall development of grain plus diversified operations , and from simply providing primary farm products to developing the intensive processing of farm and sideline products .  
Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
Beijing Municipality in recent years has achieved new vistas in revolution and liberalization , and its economic development is flourishing .  The standard of living of the people has been steadily rising , and there have been many positive changes in the face of the city , with more parks , green spaces , and beautification projects being undertaken .  The city 's air quality has also improved , opening the way for some new weather phenomena there .  
Third , the government of the locality where the S &amp; T park is located must make a change in its role and enhance its service quality , do a good job in improving the S &amp; T park 's supporting facilities , environment , communications , social order , cultural and sport facilities , basic education , public health , and social security , thus cultivate favorable conditions for the development of the park .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .  
The circular demands that through implementing the legislation law , the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments should further standardize government legislative activities , improve the quality of government legislative work , and thus spur government legislative work to express still more comprehensively and accurately General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents , " so that government legislative work , execution of laws , and supervision of execution of laws can rise to a new level .  
We should attach great importance to the work , lay stress on key issues , work perseveringly and unremittingly , be practical results-minded , ensure that work is done in a down-to-earth manner , and ensure that leading bodies of public security , judicial , and procuratorial departments are truly strengthened and the overall quality of cadres and policemen is notably improved , so that they can more effectively perform the mission entrusted to them by the party and people .  
He said that to promote national defense in future , we must " carry out nationalization of the armed forces , establish modern and highly-efficient military strength for national defense , conduct streamlined training for war , increase the combined combat-effectiveness of the three armed services , improve quality , improve welfare , and establish the dignity of the national troops . "  
Through international cooperation the Chinese science and technology community has extensively learned advanced scientific research theory and management methods , enhanced its research and development capabilities , and improved engineering and product quality . and has also gained good economic and social returns ; at the same time , they have also made their own contributions to the development of modern science .  
On the other hand , nine-year compulsory education should be promoted in a comprehensive manner .  Reform of the curriculum should be deepened and efforts should be made to set up extracurricular activity bases and science museums to cultivate the scientific knowledge and innovative awareness of secondary and primary students , and promote quality education .  
Hu Jintao , member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and vice president , stressed during a recent inspection trip in Tianjin : Strengthening the building of urban communities is a natural requirement of a well-coordinated economic and social development in cities ; and is also of a great significance to deepening reform , promoting the country 's economic growth , improving the quality of life for the masses , maintaining social stability , and consolidating the ruling position of our party .  
Between 15 and 20 June , in the company of Zhang Dejiang , secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee , and Chai Songyue , governor of Zhejiang Province , Li Lanqing mainly inspected basic education , vocational education , higher education , and scientific research in Wenzhou , Ningbo , Shaoxing , and Hangzhou . He also held meetings with representatives of the educational circles to discuss issues on deepening educational reforms , comprehensively advancing quality education , orienting education to serving local economic and social development .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the construction of recreational facilities for young people , resolutely ban electronic game rooms , singing and dancing parlors , and video show rooms which have a harmful impact on the growth of youngsters , and mete out more severe punishments to those who run such unhealthy undertakings , thus creating a benign social environment for the comprehensive implementation of quality education .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
This responsible person stressed that based on the high or low quality level of the military cadres selected from general high level universities , speaking in a definite sense , their level of quality impacts the entire level of military development and the success or failure of our undertaking .  
Over the years , the broad masses of judges and other judicial personnel of courts at the grassroots level have made continued efforts to increase their efficiency and quality in handling cases .  They have satisfactorily accomplished trial and implementing tasks .  They have made contributions to safeguarding social stability , promoting economic development , and ensuring that the broad masses of people can live and work in peace and contentment .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Over the past year , facing the complicated and ever-changing international situation and fierce international competition , the company , while having straightened out its internal relationships and striving to enable its new system to work effectively , has continued to raise the level of astronautical development and applied itself to improving quality , enabling it to successfully launch satellites and to test fly large astronautical vehicles .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
The increase in domestic and foreign demand stimulated comprehensive improvement in the production sector and enabled China 's entire economy to develop toward a good orientation .  The quality of economic performance improved steadily .  
Meanwhile , all levels of government must also do whatever they can to build a greater number of venues and facilities for healthy teenage activities . "  We must fully push ahead with quality education and provide vast numbers of teenage students with a fine social environment for growth .  In order to do that , we , with the consent of the Party Central Committee and the State Council , now issue the following circular on relevant issues on strengthening the building and management work of venues for teenage students ' extracurricular activities :  
It was learned that the age limit for various leading posts set by the party Central Committee this time is mainly to make cadres younger and more intelligent and raise the quality of the ranks of cadres .  In the mean time , it is designed to enable new cadres to receive promotion earlier and encourage leading cadres of various units to adopt new thinking in their administration .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
The key to building spiritual civilization lies in always grasping the work with perseverance and having it effectively carried out .  Specifically speaking , it should be carried out for the all-round elevation of the people 's quality among all social organizations at the grassroots level .  
Li Mingyu , a standing committee member , noted : the implementation of the strategy of ruling the country by law is demanding higher and higher standards for the quality of judges and procurators .  Placing stress on the academic requirements on judges and procurators , the current amendments have addressed just to the right issue , which suits the need for development of the legal system in our country .  
Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .  However , the quality of judges and procurators should not be reflected in their academic qualifications alone .  Examination only reveals professional standards , whereas other factors , such as political integrity and vocational ethics , can only be assessed by practical work .  
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
The central authorities repeatedly stressed that the rate of progress should be subordinated to quality .  Stressing the importance of the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) is , in essence , determined by the specific important position of counties ( cities ) , and by the condition of the leading bodies and the rank of leading cadres at this level .  
The law on farm seeds adopted at this meeting is of great significance in protecting and using seed resources , standardizing the breeding , production , management , and use of seeds , protecting the legitimate rights and interests of seed breeders , producers , managers , and users , improving the quality of seeds , promoting an industrial management of farm seeds , expediting agricultural development through science and technology , and promoting the development of crop farming .  
The existing main problems are a low overall standard of product quality , a low ratio of up-to-standard products in a considerable number of categories , the persistent act of producing fake and shoddy products in defiance of repeated bans , and the poor work in supervising and regulating quality .  
Although in each case there are objective and subjective reasons , these cases have something in common : They developed during exceptional times under exceptional conditions , and if they do not pay close attention to improving their quality , they very easily become swell-headed and make wrong decisions .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
Moreover , since Taiwan bought advanced weapons from many countries and their quality , function , and operation procedures vary from country to country , the fire control system , electronic warfare system , and command control systems of the weapons are mostly uncoordinated or imperfect .  This has a direct bearing on the normal performance of the planes ' fighting function .  
In the new historical period , departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried out reform at a deeper level , quickened development , readjusted their structure , laid a more solid foundation , improved quality , ensured supply , striven to raise their technological level and increase their ability to ensure supply , and ensured the comprehensive fulfillment of their tasks in the development of new products and in their cooperation in production .  
Following the international custom , the PBOC branches organized more than 50,000 man-trips to inspect the quality of assets and genuine profit and loss of more than 38,000 financial institutions ( including branch offices ) in order to promote the improvement of internal management of commercial banks .  
In the first half of this year , the state requested iron and steel enterprises to continue to curtail the products in oversupply and increase the products in short supply .  The state also took forceful measures to attack the inferior quality rolled steel for building purposes and closed down 225 small steel plants .

Recognizing the benefit of student contact with society , the Sociology Department also sponsors social service activities and oversees the publication of instructional texts for public distribution . Greatly matured since its reestablishment on Taiwan as a Junior College , Soochow University is distinctive for the quality education , capable educators , and generous facilities it provides .  
Sufficient advances in these industries predicate the production of a high quality doll . Ts'ui Chung , advisor to the Taiwan Toy Manufacturers Association , points out that Taiwan 's supporting industries , benefited by technical experience accumulated over the past thirty years , are unmatched by those of any other advancing nation . Taiwan 's chief competitor in the toy line is Hong Kong .  
Taiwan 's electric fan manufacturers have dedicated themselves to developing a variety of convenient , high quality fans by improving their materials and design . Heavy aluminum or iron fan leaves have in the last 20 years been replaced by light , economical plastics .  
Q : Generally speaking , the characteristics of a developed country include a prosperous society with a high income , a high quality of life , a high level of trained personnel , and high mobility , goals which we are engaged in striving to reach . Mr . Premier , would you please discuss for a moment your individual evaluations and expectations ?  
The majority of Ch'en Keng-pin 's photos are of natural scenery , where his employment of crystal-clear priorities and a delicate , quality feel took the place of the typically obscure , artificial beautification of other photographers . These attributes provided a more direct and powerful expression to the essential face of his photography .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Filming these images in black and white , besides cleansing the expressive contents by filtering out the disturbance of inappropriate hues , also gives them a special quality feel , a graininess , a tonal contrast , and a layering effect all unachievable by color as well as concentrating their feelings of emptiness , repression , and intensity in a way that only black and white can .  
In a less active sense , I hope that administrative personnel can be streamlined , that their level of quality can be raised , and that they can be more clean and honest . That is my thinking .  
If textbooks can be diversified and a certain standard of quality maintained , so that people have more choice , then education will be more lively and multifarious , and that will be of greater assistance in a child 's mental and moral growth .  
The attention of our people will gradually shift from the enjoyment of things and material well-being to the more refined and spiritual side of life , and people will stress quality rather than quantity . More emphasis will be put on enjoying life , on sampling quality products , on moving into the more rarefied atmosphere of high-class and well-designed living quarters , at the same time reaching into the top echelons of fashion - - all within the ethos of traditional Chinese culture .  
Beautification of the environment , and urban and rural planning will receive toppriority attention . These newly planned community districts and zones will spring up everywhere and improve the quality of everyday existence . New edifices will include traditional Chinese architectural features , and space for outdoor activities will also be provided for the members of each community , such as playgrounds , parks , and gardens .  
Then the quality of daily human existence for everyone will improve immeasurably as we march towards the turn of the century . . Establishing a Science CityAll our cities of today will eventually be transformed into science cities . Our economic infrastructure is based on the development of industrial science and technology . This goes hand-in-glove with the modernization of public facilities .  
Preventive planning and control of hazardous wastes will be instituted and an environmental quality monitoring network set up in order to provide accurate warning and instant response . The Taiwan area will then live up to its reputation of being a beautiful island with blue skies and green meadows , verdant mountains and clear waters . .  
In the 1950s and ' 60s people began searching for natural and manmade causes for continued poor growth of forests in Scandinavia . Many countries with stunted forest growth discovered that their rain was very acidic , some with an acid-base value as low as 4 . Since tree growth is closely dependent on water and soil quality , acid rain was suspected to be the principle cause of sluggish forest growth and a major acid rain research effort was launched .  
What 's different is , the ones doing best are no longer first-generation immigrants but Chinese Americans born in the U . S . The main reason is that the new wave of immigrants is more of a mixed bag than the previous one . That group , for coincidental reasons , was so high in quality that its like has rarely been seen . They not only improved the status of Chinese Americans as a whole , but many of their children have made brilliant accomplishments .  
I would like to express my personal appreciation of the two books I requested when subscribing to the magazine , In search of Photo Past ( , ) which offer the western reader beautiful , realistic and moving pictures of Taiwan life , the quality of which has seldom been equaled in photographic publications .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
Excellent personnel quality has always been the strongest point of our national defense . During annual recruiting for the combined forces academy , the proportion of enrollees for the navy is usually the highest , which underlines the quality standards required by the navy . In recent years however the numbers seeking admission to military school have fallen steadily , with the navy feeling the bite more than the other forces because of its reputation for the hard life .  
What impressed me most about the museum was not only the amazing collections , the good preservation , the quality of the abundant publications or the nice the tea-room and garden ; I spent a lot of time talking with the museum staff , even going to the store rooms to see and discuss various items with them . I felt that it was these people who were really the showcase . Young and educated in Taiwan , it seemed that every one of them had more than one foreign language .  
Their fine work requires great expenditure of time : An experienced tailor can make only one or two a day . Depending on the quality of materials , the labor costs for a ch'i-p'ao can range anywhere from NT $ 3,000 to NT $ 6,000 . If one adds a border or embroiders such patterns as clouds of good fortune or a ju-yi , an S-shaped jade ornament , it can easily run in excess of NT $ 10,000 . Up against cheap and convenient mass-produced clothing , the ch'i-p'ao naturally does n't stand a chance . "  
It 's worth pointing out that two years ago , when Yuan Liu participated in the world 's largest children 's book exhibition - - the Bologna Italy book fair - - they won the competition for the prize for " Best Children 's Illustrated Books " with two Chinese folk tales for children , Gumiya and The Giant and the 12 Suns . You can see from this that as far as Taiwan 's children 's books are concerned , there is not far to go in terms of raising quality .  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
Moreover , products mined or gathered using explosives , drilling and digging have more fissures , the colors are not uniform and the quality is low , so the prices are also inferior . Besides , most of the rock gets smashed and lost , so that only ten or twenty percent is actually worth keeping .  
It 's Not a Battle Between Ecology and Development ! : Huang Ta-pang , who has worked in the PBM for over 40 years , states that the marble now imported from Italy , which has excellent color , superior quality , and few cracks or fissures and is easily processed , is already the finest available material . And it is n't expensive . The costs of mining in Taiwan are high , and even if you just figure in the best mines , it is still impossible to compete .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
For example , the Lungshan Temple in Lukang could be listed as a world class artifact . The quality of the construction , the interior environment , and the primitive construction have all been preserved rather well . In particular , having National Heritage Award winner Wang Kun-shan 's nan-kuan troupe inside gave the old temple real vitality ; I really loved that .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
The National Science Council 's Twelve-Year Plan for Scientific and Technological Development identifies its four main goals as upgrading science and technology , advancing economic development , raising the public 's quality of life and establishing an independent national defense .  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
But if in the long term the good quality of cultivated fruits is to be guaranteed , then they will still have to rely on the occasional improvement from wild varieties . It is thus that the bat remains an animal of crucial importance for the fruit harvest of Southeast Asia . Eating 3,000 insects an evening : On average , 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the tropical rain forests , which are also home to 90 percent of the world 's animal and vegetable species .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
After painful lessons , the palmtop computer alliance mapped out by the Computer and Communications Research Laboratories last year made a major shift in its structure . First the number of companies was greatly reduced . At present there are only nine . Moreover , all the technical work , from materials purchasing to the design and quality control of the main board to the certification of the keyboards , is to be divided up among the participating firms .  
Because people have greater contact with the outside world and easy access to information and because everyone , particularly the middle class , is paying increasing attention to quality of life , when people see that consumer goods in Taiwan are of low quality and high price , they seek happier shopping grounds abroad . This is one method of obtaining more reasonable consumer quality .  
There are fewer and fewer kids coming along each year now : Two years ago the school still counted 37 heads , with 24 remaining last year , and only an even dozen this year . It 's hard to run a school without students : Leaving aside for a moment the question of economic efficiency , in terms of the quality of instruction , what impact does the small number of students have on learning ?  
The dig report from that time pointed out that there were two cultural levels at the site . The pottery discovered in the upper layer had writing , and brass implements had also been unearthed , so that layer seems to be from the Chou dynasty . But the lower layer was entirely from a stone tool culture . The black and light yellow pottery that was found was innovative in shape and of very high quality in technique , meaning that it must have been " an important stage in high antiquity . "  
Because he had chosen ophthalmology he took up a highly self-disciplined lifestyle He forced himself to strictly abstain from smoking and drinking , avoid anger , lead a settled , regular life , maintain a placid frame of mind , and not even to pick up heavy objects , so as to avoid any physical or mental imbalance which might make his hands unsteady and thereby affect the quality of his treatment of people 's eyes .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
Is the protagonist 's betting fervor a kind of heedless indulgence or a momentous choice of all choices ? Lest we forget , too much emphasis on such sticky and unanswerable questions runs us the risk of overlooking the comic quality that runs through the entire piece .  
On the other side of the bridge , the road climbs an embankment and approximately one hour later enters a tunnel and passes through to the quintessential stretch of road skirting the Chulu Cliffs . At a height of 770 meters above sea level , the view is astonishing and vast ; the quality of the road is excellent .  
The last generation faced problems getting by day to day , therefore they only ask that life be stable and they are satisfied . In this generation , we are into social competition and improving the quality of life , so our expectations of life are very different , " says Yeh Chu-lan . Her father wanted her to go back to their hometown after she graduated from college to teach and live a quiet life . But for her a challenging , stimulating , diverse life was much more attractive .  
His works are first baked unglazed at 1200 . Such a temperature is perfect for effecting a warm , smooth , touchable quality . lf the temperature were higher , the clay would be far too hard ; at a lower temperature , the clay would crumble . After his pottery is fired unglazed , it is smoked with firewood . Then he chooses a complementary material derived from a natural element , such as metal , wood , stone or glass ( representing water ) to combine with the pottery .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
Most proprietary teas on the British market are made from a variety of raw or processed graded teas which tea merchants buy from different Indian and African plantations or at tea auctions , and which are then carefully mixed and combined in varying proportions by professional blenders to create branded teas of stable quality , in flavors such as Earl Grey Tea , Breakfast Tea , Prince Charles Tea and so on .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
But beautification and weight-loss is anextremely complicated and personalized process . Another variable is the uneven quality of the many new operators who have sprung up to meet the demand that has come along with economic prosperity , and there are traps everywhere . There are operators who put out a lot of different hooks to catch a wide variety of unsuspecting consumers .  
The quality of the performances put on by all these professional and amateur groups and individuals ranges from the appalling to the excellent , and audiences can pick and choose just as at a flea market . Around 10% of the fringe performances are special enough to have a chance of returning in a few years ' time as part of the official program .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
Wu was ahead of her at school , so she has witnessed his long-term development . Back in school , Wu was a well-behaved child with a special classical quality to him . Then Chung saw him dancing in a loin cloth for the Cloud Gate Dance Theater , establishing the experimental Contemporary Legend Theater , and acting in movies and on television . His creative ability and experience made her feel that he was the best choice for Ah-Q .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
One of the more extreme examples often cited is that of the nearby Philippines , where university education is very common . Nevertheless , even the Filipina maids who come to work in Taiwan have university diplomas , thus wasting the talented manpower of that nation . How should the quality of human labor be synchronized with economic development ?  
In early December of last year , the Public Television Broadcasting Law was first placed on the Legislative Yuan 's agenda , and the legislators started discussing its every provision . Those legislators who support the law say that the TV programs we currently have are hardly up to snuff . The ones to be blamed for Taiwan 's questionable quality of culture are commercial TV stations . In order not to let Taiwan 's programming be devoured by alien pop culture , we need a public television station to produce high-quality shows .  
Many people , regardless of how they feel about classical music , recognize that raising the " quality " of the nation is something that begins within people themselves . We must now simply wait to see what sort of reactions will be stirred by this encounter between the mass medium of radio , and the refined realm of classical music .  
He also described a demonstration of a sword 's quality : at one stroke it cut clean through 10 large nails hammered into a wooden upright of a building , yet its edge was quite undulled . With an effort the blade could be bent almost double , but when released it snapped back as straight as a bowstring .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
Professor Huang Ping-huang of the Department of Education at National Chengchi University ( NCCU ) also believes that initiative is the quality most lacking in today 's primary and middle school teachers : " They are so accustomed to eating instant noodles that they have forgotten how to cook . "  
ROC naval planning assumes that the PRC is the most likely enemy . Considering Taiwan 's defensive strategy and the limits on the tolerable defense budget burden , the ROC is aiming for a force that will be " small in numbers but high in quality . " The maritime component of such a force must be able to deal with threats from the air or from the surface or sub-surface of the ocean ; it is also responsible for maintaining a credible amphibious capability .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
Liu Ming-lung , secretary-general of the Environmental Quality Education Foundation , notes that wet paddy field has a number of useful environmental functions , including stabilizing flow volume in rivers , absorbing excess in times of heavy rains and floods , improving water quality , reducing soil erosion , and improving air quality .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality . The soil is very rocky , making planting of paddy rice difficult , so the land must be cleared to a depth of at least 20 centimeters . Though large stones can be dug up with heavy machinery , small stones have to be removed by hand as they are uncovered during plowing .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
Most of the plants used by Taiwan 's herbalists come from mainland China . This makes both the supply and the quality unstable because the same plant grown in different regions , or under different weather and climatic conditions , will produce different medicinal effects . This makes necessary the use of biotechnology in the artificial cultivatation of Chinese herbal medicines .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
As economic conditions and the quality of life have improved , people today naturally value life far more highly than in former times . For instance , although chickenpox usually produces only mild symptoms , it is potentially crippling or even fatal . Old people still believe that the earlier a child gets chickenpox the better , but despite the high price of the chickenpox vaccine now imported from America , many parents are willing to have their children immunized .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
Twenty years ago Shiatzy presented an improved chi pao . Influenced by the film The Last Emperor , ten years ago they created an awe-inspiring imperial effect using Qing style beadwork and embroidery , silks , satins and velvets , in brown , gold and purple colors . This year Shiatzy are using cotton and linen with hand-drawn designs to create a Zen-like poetic quality .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
While the star school phenomenon is not something that can be changed overnight , the pecking order among middle rank schools is already growing blurred . If high schools work together to raise the quality of education , perhaps the star school syndrome will just fade away on its own .  
This accounts for the lustrous , vibrant quality of the tricolor glazed pottery of the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , though the fact that tricolor pottery was fired at less than 1000 _ C meant it was prone to break . Also , the finished works differed widely from each other depending on the quality of the clay , the type of glaze , the temperature and even the kind of chimney in the kiln . At higher temperatures , for example , the glaze lost its fluidity .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
Likewise , any temple worth its salt expects to receive offerings of a certain aesthetic standard . In Buddhist music too , there is a range of quality , ranging from the superb to the dire .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two . One half is being used to raise fish , which has ruined water quality in the other half and killed off all the aquatic plants that had been growing there .  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
Dong enjoys enthusiastic support from the local community , which has provided him with generous financial assistance , manpower , filming locations , and more . The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast-food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5% of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
The head of the team , Wang Chao-yi , points out that the high quality pebbles found underground in the Kuanyin alluvial plain have been disastrous as idle farmland has drawn illegal gravel mining , and the gravel pits have then been used as landfills , leaving behind a ravaged landscape . Since 1994 , residents of Paochang Village in Kuanyin Rural Township have been trying to protect the environment by blocking off coastal roads to gravel and garbage trucks . Unfortunately , new problems keep cropping up .  
Lin Jingquan , a graduate of a national music academy in Fujian Province , edited the lyrics of many gezai xi librettos , making them both colloquial and elegant at the same time . He devised a new cadence , and tied the vocal music more closely to the characters and plots . His efforts greatly improved the quality of gezai xi and helped bring about the great flourishing of gezai xi that was to occur in the 1960s .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
But this rare catch of a pregnant shark also confirmed how late whale sharks mature , and showed that in their reproductive strategy they prefer " quality " over " quantity . " In today 's age of unbridled exploitation of ocean fisheries , this does not bode well for the survival of whale shark populations .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
In recent years , the AVRDC has also stepped up the economic evaluation of its projects , to assess the socio-economic benefits of improved vegetable varieties and growing methods . One of the major reasons for setting up the AVRDC was the hope that it could promote the cultivation of vegetables of a high nutritional value , to improve the nutritional status and quality of life for the people of many developing countries , and promote those countries ' overall national development .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
The steel is then pounded and ground into a shape roughly approximating that of the eventual blade . This process is repeated 36 times to be absolutely sure the blade will stand up to severe punishment . After the steel has been through smelting , heat treatment , hammering , and cooling , the metal is deliberately exposed to the elements to test its quality . The rusted blade is then subjected to a beating , and will be thrown away if it ca n't withstand the punishment .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Pots made from blackish ash-colored clay are also few in number , but they too have some special characteristics . The jars and vases have small mouths and big bellies . The material is of very fine quality and the exterior surfaces have undergone smoothing and polishing . There are broken lines and circles on the exterior surfaces of the " shoulder " portion , and these decorative line patterns normally encircle the outside of the vessel .  
Nautica won the affections of consumers with an appreciation for quality-made athletic clothing . Customers were first allured by the clothing 's colorful vitality and the unaffected simplicity of the design . However , upon further inspection they would discover that the clothing was very practical , as well . From the material and the tailoring work , to the location of the pockets and the adjustable sleeves , all the way down to minute details like the size of the zipper , Nautica 's quality was immediately self-evident .  
During the 80s , in conjunction with extensive land development , the capital costs of salt making and the quality of the final product made it impossible to compete with imported salt for market share . Furthermore , those willing to do the backbreaking work of exposing the salt to the sun were becoming harder to find .  
The Japanese , well acquainted with the curative effects of hot springs , were pleasantly surprised to discover Peitou 's hot springs whilst hunting down anti-Japanese rebels and collecting sulfur . In a short time , a hostel offering bathing pools for army use was built on the site , along with the Taipei Garrison Hospital , Recuperation Branch-both were completed with the same speed and quality of construction used in the other areas of Taipei and Peitou .  
Generally speaking , before the 1980s the focus of agriculturalists was on improving production and increasing the strains ' ability to withstand heat and disease , whereas since the 1980s the emphasis has been on improving quality , to make the cooked rice as succulent , firm , and delicious as possible .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
Another said that the main consideration in the quantity and quality of arms sold to Taiwan would be the extent of the Chinese threat , and that in both quantitative and qualitative terms the US would endeavor to help Taiwan maintain a defense capability at a level proportionate to China 's national power .  
Take for example the laws on domestic violence . Every locality has established a commission and a center for prevention of domestic violence , but these typically lack adequate staffing . For example , there are only two social workers assigned to handling domestic violence cases for all the married women in Hsinchu County , so you can guess what the quality of services there is like .  
When word got around about the teachers , Overseas Chinese rushed to sign up , so that the number of enrollments increased sharply to a figure far above that anticipated . Liu Shu-hui , principal of the Frankfurt Chinese School , who was in charge of organizing the event , began to worry that there would be too many students , so it would be impossible to give each the care and attention desired , thereby affecting the quality of the camp , and she began to refuse people .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
The asphalt itself creates many lines on its own , and these give the paintings a simple and unpretentious quality . No wonder Chiu has become so thoroughly enamored of asphalt . Interestingly , while we are used to seeing asphalt that is black due to its thickness , it turns into various shades of brown when diluted with solvent . Sometimes , Chiu adds pigment to give the asphalt " color . "  
At the height of its production the Wushulin plant pressed as much as 1,600 metric tons of cane daily . Not only did Wushulin have a huge capacity , its products were of excellent quality and were specially designated for use by the Japanese royal household . As a result , the plant was much praised by the colonial " motherland . "  
However , Professor Chen Kuan-jeng , a demographer at Chang Gung University 's Department of Healthcare Administration , thinks that the lowering of the birth rate in those years was not necessarily the result of a successful family planning policy , but rather due to the fact that as medical science advanced and infant mortality receded , people no longer needed to have as many children . With economic growth people also tended to dedicate themselves to making money and improving their material quality of life , which naturally resulted in a declining birth rate .  
As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
Although this winter Mingcheng 's Murcott production was not very high , the quality was excellent . Thanks to a high 13-degree sugar / acid ratio ( sugar content / free acid content ) and free media publicity thrown in by the home distribution company , the day after the ads appeared the borough head , Chang Jui-tuan , who was responsible for taking phone orders , spent the whole day on the phone .  
The groups he leads typically have " free time " scheduled for half a day or a full day so as to allow his charges to deeply experience and probe nature . " The special quality of ecotourism lies in its leisureliness , " stresses Chen Chang-po . When the travel itinerary is too tight , it fosters anxiety among the tourists and tour operators . Only when the mood is relaxed can one discard the pressures and cares of work and everyday life and allow one 's heart and mind to converse with and reconnect to nature .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
Ko Tsang-ming explains that neurofibromatosis is a common autosomal dominant inherited single-gene disorder . In approximately 60% of patients the symptoms are slight , and in another 20% the tumors can be surgically removed . But in the remaining 20% of patients the symptoms are very serious and severely affect their quality of life .  
These days , Taiwan 's last remaining ink maker is something of an urban recluse , his shop tucked away in a remote corner of the city . For nearly half a century , he has borne the stifling heat and complex manufacturing process , determined to produce block after block of quality hand-made ink . But it has n't always been this way . The industry had its day in the sun in the 1970s , when the economy was booming and the study of calligraphy compulsory .  
In the last few years , the Industrial Technology Research Institute and Teco have both dedicated efforts to researching carbon nanotube field emission displays ( CNT FED ) . These displays take advantage of carbon nanotubes ' low-conducting electrical fields , high-emission current densities , and highly stable character . On the one hand , they match the picture quality of CRT televisions , while on the other , they offer benefits such as low power consumption and slim form factors in developing all-new flat-screen displays .  
Post-secondary education is the best way to break down barriers between social groups and achieve social equity . Taiwan , however , is faced with a problem : her relatively inexpensive public schools have only enough slots to accept approximately 30% of her high school graduates , but most children of salaried and manual workers and of lower - and middle-income families go on to study at the more expensive private schools which tend to have fewer resources , and offer lower quality educations .  
The quality of building materials , the increased use of metal , cement , and plastic , and the uninspired colors , all make for a disorderly urban environment . No attempt is made to achieve a harmonious unity . Even on the drawing board , every building competes with every other building for attention .  
After these decorative lines are dry , they spray on a layer of yellow paint , and then add gold leaf . Before applying the gold leaf , they 've got to first apply some glue designed for that purpose : " You 've got to precisely control the time that the gold leaf glue dries , because that will affect on the quality of the gold leaf . If it 's too wet , it 's difficult to spread evenly ; if it 's too dry , it wo n't stick . "  
Chang specifically targeted seasoned pedagogues who were at or close to retirement age , reasoning that it would be the best way to attract true lovers of the teaching profession . Such individuals would be teaching primarily for the sheer pleasure of it rather than merely for profit . The teachers ' essentially altruistic persuasion along with their experience and dedication would combine to create an academic atmosphere high in quality but low in expense .

The civil service is trying to provide specific answers to this popular concern through transparent processes that are available to ordinary citizens , who in this way can find out not only how , why and for what purpose a particular civil servant was hired , but also how much this costs the State and , above all , what that person 's actual contribution is in measurable terms of quantity , quality and cost-effectiveness .  
There may be merit in some of these assertions , but this is only correct when the public sector is not well trained ; when its size can not be justified on the output and quality of services offered ; or when the policies it delivers run counter to the accumulation of national wealth , efficient delivery of social services or administration of justice .  
The Committee noted with regret that the economic constraints resulting from the transition process were having a negative impact on women 's employment and health ; female unemployment was increasing and the quality of social services provided to women was deteriorating .

To reach the technical standards for product quality in various countries , China 's household electrical appliance enterprises persisted in producing high-quality products in compliance with internationalized standards to obtain international certification under the system of product quality assurance by numerous exporting countries , thus completing the first step they must take in entering the international market , securing the " pass " to the international market , and opening up an international passageway .  
He then pointed out : In studying Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , we should base ourselves on the purpose of enabling leading cadres at various levels to clearly understand the importance and necessity of doing a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( or city ) level , on the purpose of improving the ideological and political quality of cadres at all levels , and on the purpose of solving problems in a down-to-earth manner .

Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .

Now that Guangdong has built up considerable economic strength , how should it grasp the new opportunity and improve its overall economic quality through positive involvement in full-fledged competition in the international market on the basis of consolidating and developing the existing economy is a new task .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality .

Knowledge and qualified personnel , national quality , and innovation capability have increasingly become important indicators of comprehensive national capability and critical factors of advancing or constraining economic growth and social development .  
To accelerate the achievement of national modernization , to strengthen comprehensive national capability and international competitiveness , and to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the new century , it is imperative to earnestly implement the CPC 's education policy , to vigorously develop education , to comprehensively advance personal quality education , and to promote the comprehensive development of children and youths , in an effort to train high quality workers and specialized personnel of various levels and fields meeting the requirements of modernization construction .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .  
Beijing has become not only the largest education base nationwide , but also a renowned international education center in the Asia-Pacific region , thereby laying a good foundation for deepening education reform and comprehensively carrying out personal quality education .  
However , the capital city 's education still has many problems which urgently need to be resolved : there remains a prominent contradiction between the growing education needs of the masses of the people and education 's insufficient supply in quantitative terms and low quality ;  
It is necessary , on the basis of centering on personal quality education , to intensify the reform of the school-running system and to encourage social forces to operate schools , so as to meet the need of economic development and comprehensive social progress for diverse personnel and to meet needs of the capital city 's reform , opening , and modernization construction .

Article 24 In places where industrial wastewater and urban sewage are used for irrigation , the agricultural authority of local people 's governments at or above the county level shall organize regular monitoring of the quality of water used for irrigation and the irrigated soil and farm produce and shall take appropriate measures to prevent the pollution of soil , underground water , and farm produce .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
He stressed the need to conscientiously study and comprehensively understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's recent important speech on strengthening and improving the educational work , and implement his instructions in routine work .  School education , family education , and social education should be properly combined .  With the joint efforts of all parties concerned , a benign atmosphere for quality education should be created in society , and more favorable environment and conditions be created for youngsters ' healthy growth .  
To a certain extent , Putin 's victory is also related to his personal quality .  In Russians , he has left the impressions of a person who " is steady , " " does solid work , " " has an iron hand , " " is healthy , " and " is bold but cautious . "  His election as president of the new century by the common people showed that the common people have great expectations for him , and hope he will lead Russia to a prosperous , stable , and strong tomorrow .  
In our country , now tourism has been moving onto the path of comprehensive development with three major market sectors , namely , tourism for people entering the Chinese mainland , domestic tourism , and tourism for domestic people traveling abroad , and now tourism is a large-scale industry with a huge market and great output value .

In order to ensure stringent and impartial law enforcement and prevent power abuse , the public security organs at various levels have also persistently and unremittingly addressed in a focused way such problems as misuse of coercive measures , extended custody , extortion of confession by torture , arbitrary imposition of fines , and arbitrary collection of fees .  As a result , the law-enforcement work of the public security community has become more regularized and the quality of law enforcement has improved rather significantly .  
The second-worst quality variety is the corn in the northeast .  There is an idiom that says , " grow on the fire , harvest on the ice . "  It means , the time to harvest the corn is when it is frozen to death .  The corn is not completely mature .  The frozen kernel is tough and contains a lot of water .  But if you roast it , the kernel becomes flat and dry .  
It is not just in agriculture .  Improving agricultural quality and raising the quality of farming products is based on the attitude of national economic smoothness and lasting development .  Improving farmers ' income is the basic difference from the past .  
The targets for controlling COD , nitrogen , phosphorus , and petroleum should comprehensively attain the requirements for controlling the volume and the total amount of pollutants ; the water quality of near-shore water areas should comprehensively attain the defined environmental protection targets in areas according to their functions .  The ecology should basically realize a benign cycle , and the environment of a number of key sea areas should be comprehensively improved .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
Luo Dahua , professor of psychology of China Politics and Law University , said : In foreign countries , the main purpose of their psychologists ' visits to prisons is to cure criminals with fairly evident psychological disease , but in China , our psychological treatment for criminals is aimed at transforming them in line with the criminals ' personal characteristics and raising the psychological quality of the entire group of prisoners .  
Zhu Rongji stressed : The leaders of state enterprises should all act in line with the requirements of the central authorities ; and strive to turn themselves into operators and managers who have a sound ideological and political quality , enjoy a strong ability in business operation and management , strictly observe the law and discipline , and remain honest and self-disciplined in performing their official duties .  To this end , they should be eager to study , diligent in their studies , and good at their studies .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Under the present circumstances wherein the contradiction between pastures and livestock has proved a predominant problem in a majority of pastoral areas in the region , we should no longer follow the old development road of a quantity expansion .  Instead , we must make up our mind to increase the intensity of changing the growth pattern of the economy ; and lay the stress of the region 's development of animal husbandry on improving breeds , upgrading pastures , enhancing quality , and boosting economic efficiency .  
An authoritative person analyzed the situation when he was interviewed by reporters and noted that the driving forces included mainly the following : The showing of the effectiveness of the policy of macro-control , the increase of demand for export as a result of the recovery of the global economy , the significant improvement of quality in industrial production , the new motive force as a result of the rapid development of new and high-tech industries , and the " popular feeling " that expect good economic growth .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
should reform the course structures and examination and appraisal systems to integrate the easing of the students ' excessive burdens with the improvement of the quality of education and teaching as well as the cultivation of the students ' indomitable will and spirit of assiduous study ; and should make sure they achieve , within this year as scheduled , the " two basic " goals of basically popularizing the nine-year compulsory education and basically eliminating illiteracy among people in their youth and the prime of life .  
Comrade Mao Zedong said during the rectification campaign in Yanan : Only when we master Marxism can our contingent be consolidated , can our cadres be enhanced in quality , and can we have the ability to meet and to have control over a future bright world .  
The extensive application of high technology has enhanced weapons ' accuracy and lethality , and enabled the soft equipment to withstand dual attack - - the " hard attack " and the " soft killing . "  The accelerated loss rate needs the supplement of network technology and strength not only with high quality but also at a high speed .  
Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
The most important things ahead of logistics units at present are as follows : 1 ) The unified logistics units at various levels should have a sense of urgency , strive to upgrade the quality of commanding modern wars , strengthen the building of information networks , and set up as quickly as possible a swift , sensitive , and high-efficiency commanding system .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
To strengthen the awareness of leaders at all levels in leading troops in war , the group army has promoted innovations centered on existing equipment , explored the battle method of winning against the enemy 's superiority under an unfavorable situation ; mastered automated field operation command ; enhanced comprehensive quality of officers and men ;  
As the new model aircraft had very powerful mechanical functions and was installed with video camera and laser display equipment , it was capable of appraising the tactics and firepower response of the artillery unit .  It also had the function of simulated missile launch , thereby creating conditions for raising the quality of training in " three attacks and three defenses . "  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
In line with their sacred missions and tasks , officers and men adhered to high standards and strove to set first-class standard .  They comprehensively improved their ideological and political quality ; quality of military professionalism ;  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
As far as the military is concerned , a very important aspect in adhering to the Party 's basic line is to implement of the strategy of building up the military in quality and to consistently conform to the combat strength standard , with comprehensively strengthening the military 's combat force and making sufficient preparations for winning high-tech wars in the future as both the starting point and the end-result of all our work .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
The general goal of relying on regular higher education to train military cadres is , in line with the principle of formulating overall plans , making steady progress , and ensuring quality , to adopt various measures to encourage and attract students of regular schools of higher learning to work in the military after graduation and to establish systems and formulate and improve policies and rules to gradually increase the number of students selected to receive the training and improve the training quality so to secure stable and reliable sources of high-quality personnel for the military .  
Holding the major responsibility for ensuring the quality of the training , regular schools of higher learning should attach great importance to ideological and political education , persistently arm the students with scientific theory , and help the students firm up their faith in communist ideals and embrace correct outlook on the world , life , and value .  
In the network and information age , Western political ideology tends to infiltrate us via various channels .  In this connection , the army must persist in a correct direction in the ideological and political education work and must concentrate efforts on raising the ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural quality of officers and men .  
In the course of utilizing advanced scientific methods to conduct political education , there is a need to strive to tap into the nation 's outstanding cultural tradition and education resources , to constantly stimulate officers ' and men 's sense of identity with national culture , to enhance immunity against the infiltration of Western culture , and to raise the level and quality of entertainment appreciation among officers and men .  
When conducting ideological and political education , we should expand intention and extension of ideological and political education , and while helping raise the ethical quality of officers and men we must also incorporate the raising of their scientific and technological levels into the educational scope .  
This many foreign investment companies and such an enormous amount of capital coming in have not only made China into the developing country making the greatest use of foreign capital in a short span of 20 years , in addition the massive influx of foreign goods , advanced technology and equipment , and scientific management experience is gradually changing the quality of the people 's lives , updating their traditional thinking and concepts , and becoming an indispensable part of the development of China 's economy .  
In addition to encouraging the large-scale introduction of foreign capital , China has put a fair amount of emphasis all along on the quality of the utilization of foreign capital , laying out clearly the guiding policies for the active , reasonable , and effective utilization of foreign capital .  
Accordingly , to adapt to the changing circumstances and promote the long-term dynamic stability in our international balance of payments , as well as safeguarding national economic security and the interests of foreign investors , we must concentrate hard on the key issue of improving the quality of utilization of foreign capital .  
He said that our army 's cadre ranks must be developed in an allaround way and up-to-standard ideologically and politically and in terms of scientific and educational level , military occupational specialty , and physical and mental conditions , and they must have a good overall quality .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , our comprehensive national strength continued to grow , the productivity continued to rise to a higher and higher level , and the people 's living quality also continued to improve .  The interests of the broadest people were continuously fulfilled and guaranteed .  The leadership of the CPC won heartfelt support of the entire people of all ethnic groups throughout the country .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
When the soldiers ran down the hill , they were already wet and exhausted .  As soon as the exercise ended , cadres of the company promptly exhorted the soldiers that the new equipment training was aimed at testing the comprehensive military quality of soldiers .  They said that even though they had four-wheeled armored vehicles , they still needed to train their two legs , and that only when the strong skills were maintained and new skills were not weak could they realize a new leap in combat strength .  
A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
The Bayi Men 's Basketball Team has defeated its competitors in consecutive games and has won games one after the other because the team - consistently aiming for first-class quality in their play is consistent and strict in managing the team , applies scientific theories to training , constantly perfecting the skills of every player , does not consider losses for and gains to individuals and relies on teamwork for victories .  Unity leads to combat strength and industrious training leads to excellent soldiers .  
In future international competitions , able personnel and the quality of man will become two decisive factors , and whoever can successfully seize the commanding heights in the field of able personnel and can hold in possession rich human sources will be able to gain the upper hand in competition .  
Price cartel has drawbacks of monopoly - - it will mislead enterprises to escape competition and not to improve their efficiency , which has an adverse effect on improving enterprises ' management , upgrading their technology , saving efficient enterprises and eliminating poor ones , improving the overall quality of the entire industry , and on the overall development of the industry .  For this reason , it has been unable to correct using a market means the practice of redundant construction in the past .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
The people are now seeking the enhancement of their life quality after they achieved quantitative satisfaction .  The broad masses have truly feel the great superiority of socialism from their personal experience in the great enhancement of their own living standards , and support socialism from the bottom of their hearts .  Socialism has won an extensive and profound mass foundation in China .  
Through reform , all the military 's colleges and universities should enable our military 's colleges and universities to catch up with the world 's technological progress , military revolution and trends in educational development with respect to educational concepts , infrastructure , curricular and research capabilities , and academic levels .  All military colleges and universities should create famous brands , try to be members of the first class , and make greater contributions to cultivating and supplying talented military professionals of high quality .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
We must make bold explorations , and have the courage to carry out implementation in such aspects as the policy system , the organizational mechanism , incentive measures , and means for ensuring a sufficient logistical supply , and constantly enhance the vigor of the military work .  In our innovation of the methods of operation , methods of training , and methods of management , we should set our eyes on improving the quality of our military ;  
The competition of comprehensive national strength in the 21st century is , in the final analysis , the competition of the quality of people and talent .  Social science plays a very important and irreplaceable role in developing people 's wisdom , cultivating talent with both ability and political integrity , arousing people 's initiative and creativeness , and strengthening the rallying power of people of the whole country .  
The broad policies and specific principles for reforming state enterprises and lifting them out of difficulty have been clearly laid down by the central authorities and all major policy measures have been promulgated .  The key now is to continue the effort to implement them properly in accordance with the central authorities ' plan .  It is necessary to harmonize speed with efficiency , scale with structure , and quantity with quality , putting quality improvement and efficiency enhancement first ;  
Supervision and management should be strengthened and landmark projects for technological transformation should be accomplished as scheduled .  Technological transformation must center on variety , quality , efficiency , and expansion of export .  High and new technology and advanced , applicable technology should be used to transform a batch of key enterprises in the important industries to develop products that enjoy competitive advantages and to stem redundant development in an effective way .  
The scale of these building activities is large , and they have broad impact .  They have raised the level of civilization in the cities and the ethical quality of the citizens and played a positive promotional role for the stability of reform and development .  
At the same time , in the roadway development for the western region , we must put intense emphasis on ecological and environmental protection and management , protecting cultivated lands , economizing on land use , and industriously integrating roadway development with the improvement of the surrounding environment .  We do this in order to improve the ecology and environment of the west , and to contribute to the enhancement of environmental quality .  
From a long-term perspective , in order to attain sustained and healthy agricultural and rural economic development , first of all , it is necessary to further push forward the agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment in light of the arrangements made by the central authorities , heighten the quality and economic results of agricultural products , and increase peasants ' income .  
We should put the improvement of quality and enhancement of economic result high on the agenda .  Guided by the market , we should make active efforts to push forward the structural adjustment , do a good job in controlling total supply and total demand , resolutely eliminate enterprises with inferior production capability , and avoid making the same mistake of duplicating construction projects .  We should integrate the periodical goal with the long-term goal of carrying out the reform and development of state-owned enterprises .  
The evaluation of authoritative figures regarding all this is that the quality of economic growth has improved somewhat , the various relationships are more harmonious , production and consumption have developed together , and macro and micro are increasing in parallel .  
By grasping overall and key problems related to the comprehensive building of the grassroots party organizations , we can truly resolve problems in the grassroots party organizations that are of the nature of trends , ensure the effects and quality of " three stresses " education , and successfully achieve marked ideological improvement , marked political progress , marked transformation of work style , marked strengthening of discipline , marked progress in work , marked changes in quality , marked strengthening of the fortress role , and marked improvement in relations between officers and men .  
In October 1978 , the central government convened the third national people 's defense work conference , determined the people 's air defense principle of " making overall planning , giving play to major points , integrating peacetime and wartime efforts , and putting quality first , " thus entering a stage in the people 's air defense work that stressed comprehensive and coordinated development , quality , and combining peacetime and wartime efforts .  
The input into the construction of ecological construction has been noticeably increased .  The engineering projects of returning grain plots to forestry and protecting natural forests and the projects of harnessing " three rivers " ( Huaihe River , Liaohe River , and Haihe River ) and " three lakes " ( Taihu Lake , Dianchi Lake , and Chaohu Lake ) have obtained phased achievements .  The environmental quality in urban areas has improved and the sense of environmental protection among the whole people has noticeably enhanced .  
Scientific and technological progress and innovation are decisive factors for developing productive forces and are increasingly becoming the leading force for the economic and social developments .  Only by quickening scientific and technological progress and improving the capability of technical innovation can we promote structural readjustment , enhance the overall quality of national economy , and realize bigger development of social productive forces .  
Judging from the implementation of the five-year plan in the first four years , a sustained and steady growth was attained in agricultural production , the conditions of the supply and demand of agricultural products were fundamentally improved , the agricultural structural adjustment made a new advance , agriculture and the non-agricultural sector developed unceasingly , the peasants ' incomes increased to some extent , quality of life was further enhanced , and the rural economy obtained comprehensive development .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
Chen Mingduan demanded that through the forum , all units popularize the experience and practice of advanced units in light of actual conditions and fully strengthen the building of grass-roots party branches of provincial military district units , so as to push forward the implementation of various tasks .  Chen pointed out the need to step up grass-roots party branch building ; properly select cadres and form leading bodies ; enhance training in the military and political quality of party branch members ; implement well party rules and regulations ;  
The agricultural and rural economic structural adjustment has a good beginning , quality agricultural products have made rapid development , and the major crop production has been further centralized in the advantageous producing areas .  
Ma : Since reform and opening up , while civil air defense work has achieved marked results , as our socialist market economy has intensified , reformed , and developed , civil air defense has grown increasingly unsuited to the needs of the " market " and the " battlefield " , and remains unsuited to the needs of future wars in areas such as rapid response , project construction quality , and recycling and re-supply capacity .  
This means shifting our civil air defense focus from service to winning high-tech wars , our civil air defense priority to higher high-tech content and establishing quality and better organizational command and emergency rescue capabilities , our civil air defense guidance to construction and management in accordance with law , and our civil air defense efficiency to the real achievement of a good cycle of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
According to the developing or changing situation , especially the complicated struggle going on in the ideological field , and in view of salient problems affecting the quality and effects of education , we should lay special stress on and adhere to such principles as educating people in Marxism , combining the advanced nature of the overall requirements with the level of specific work , being good at drawing on and acting in a spirit reflecting the progress of the times , and always focusing our attention on solving problems .  
Every communist , especially the leading cadres , must take warning from this , and truly succeed in being completely upright and uncorrupted , resist the lure of power , money , and sex with noble communist uprightness , and uphold and carry forward the quality and demeanor of communists .  
With the ideological and political quality of the party rank and file and party cadres being enhanced , they will have a strong sense of fighting against corruption and keeping themselves clean and honest in performing official duties .  This will not only eliminate the root cause that engenders corruption , but will also make it hard for corrupt elements to cover up their malpractices .  
The political criteria should be put in the primary position in the assessment of candidates .  In addition to laying stress on a cadre 's political position and standpoint , and behavior in abiding by political discipline , we should also examine whether the cadre is honest and incorrupt in performing official duties , and take this as a major criterion for assessing the quality of a cadre .  
As far as party building is concerned , while ensuring the party 's leading status , how are we going to further perfect the party 's leadership , truly enhance the ideological and political quality of our cadres at all levels , ensure that our party is always the " loyal representative in three aspects " , and effectively curb the corrosive influence of corrupt phenomena on our party 's ranks of cadres ?  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
Therefore , it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the work of controlling the political and ideological conditions of the cadres .  In particular , it is necessary to set up concrete procedures and work out concrete standards and methods for assessing the political and ideological quality of a cadre .  The conclusion of the assessment should also be more specific and detailed .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
He regarded political work as the lifeline of Army building and conscientiously organized units to study the resolution of the Gutian Conference and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention . He promoted democracy in the three main fields , inspired the political consciousness of officers and men , worked hard to raise the military and political quality of the units , and educated them to forever preserve the true colors and fighting style of a people 's Army .  
learn from his style of studying diligently , attaching importance to investigation and research , and working carefully and meticulously with fastidious attention , to denounce the unhealthy tendency of falsification and performing duties in a perfunctory manner ; and learn from his excellent quality of cleanness , uprightness , honesty , hard work , and thrifty living , to forever maintain the true political colors of plain living and hard struggle .  
The training quality will directly affect the implementation of work related to combat readiness .  In giving training guidance , this department persisted in guiding the equipment training practice with scientific and technological achievements , and chanted the slogan of " conducting training with science and technology and doing everything for the sake of winning the battle " during the training .  It also probed into the law governing military training with science and technology in order to seek development in equipment training .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .  
Guangzhou Military Area Command devoted firm and resolute effort to formulating fighting strength and logistic supply abilities on the basis of military units as a whole .  This measure focused on the crucial point in the current construction of fighting strength throughout the military .  It is of great significance for preparing for military struggles according to higher standards and quality criteria .  
Designated as the " blue army " in a combined tactical training base , a certain armored brigade of the Beijing Military Region has conducted confrontation exercises with several " red army " divisions and brigades in succession , thus playing an important role in inspecting the military region 's achievements in training with science and technology and raising the quality of the training .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
Relatively speaking , there should be a readjustment of the structural setup of such representative " traditional industries " as the metallurgical , petroleum , coal , textile , machinery , and shipping industries , improving their growth quality and shifting from extensive development to intensive development .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
In the past five years , this country that is in the midst of advancing socialist modernization not only reined in the unbridled horse of inflation , but also curbed the trend of deflation .  China accomplished the unusual feat of yearly economic growth of eight percent accompanied by improvement of quality and efficiency of economic growth .  
In recent years , following its sustained economic growth , India has become more eager to have its position as a big country recognized .  Therefore , it has continuously increased its national defense budget ( The 2000-2001 national defense budget increased by as much as 28.2 percent . ) and strengthened its military strength in quantity and quality .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
We will selectively support a group of backbone enterprises in the energy , metallurgy , chemical , light , textile , machinery , automobile , building materials , and construction industries in their efforts to carry out technical transformation and improve the standards of their technology and equipment while working around the goals of increasing product varieties , improving quality , conserving energy , preventing and controlling pollution , expanding exports , and improving labor productivity .  
Without the lofty ideal of being unselfish , afraid of nothing and ethical in fulfilling one 's official duties , could we maintain the political quality of the people 's army and walk at the cutting edge of society as a whole in the socialist spiritual civilization construction despite the infiltration of money worship , hedonism and extreme individualism ?  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
The reporter has learned that these units that were evaluated as tops in training have several clear features : Their major military and political officers are all outstanding commanders , having top overall comprehensive quality , and very strong command and control training ability .  
These leaders should pay attention to study characteristics of these units , meticulously review positive experiences drawn from practice , and enthusiastically explore new issues and new problems that arise in the condition of reforming , opening up and developing a socialist market economy .  These leaders should closely associate the essence of the five-sentence general requirement and the " Program " with the reality of these " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units , work in a creative manner and continuously improve the quality and efficiency of our work .  
During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .  This made many talented people reluctant to serve in the armed forces , and various armed forces personnel in key positions to decide against making it a career .  This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
Cadres should consistently educate themselves on Marxist theory , Party members ' ideals and convictions and the excellent traditions of our Party and military .  Cadres should utilize a wartime work style , revolutionary spirit and be fully dedicated to their career to inspire themselves .  As long as they can , they will be struggling for the interests of the Party , the country and the people wholeheartedly and carrying out our military 's sacred mission , as dictated by the times , to the highest standards and to the highest level of quality .  
Sixth , vigorously implement the strategy of invigorating Tibet through science and education , give priority to the development of education , exploit and make good use of human and S &amp; T resources within and without Tibet and shift economic and social development to the track of reliance on scientific and technological advances and improved quality of laborers .  
According to the long-range goal put forth at the 15th Party Congress , our country will scale a new height in economic and social development during the 10th five-year period .  The goal is : Maintaining a relatively rapid development pace in the national economy , achieving notable results in strategic economic restructuring , and significantly improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth , thereby laying a strong foundation for the GDP in 2010 to double that of 2000 ;  
Military cadres at divisional and regimental rank , as the crucial and important motors of military construction , have lived through tests as leaders , accumulated rich experiences in being leaders .  They are loyal to the Party , have a strong sense of professionalism and responsibility , and possess a high , comprehensive quality : of theory , of innovation and discipline .  
The vast majority of these comrades are young in age , good in political quality , highly educated , possessing of strong professional ability , broadminded , ideologically emancipated , highly conscious of reform , and down-to-earth in style of work .  
The latest statistics show that China continues to be in front rank of the world in the amount of foreign capital used but , in light of the national condition that we have a vast territory but a dense population and there is a wide economic gap between regions , the use of foreign capital still needs to be expanded and its quality improved .  
As a result , there is a more reliable guarantee for the resource of funds to pay the interests of treasury bonds .  Particularly , with the expansion of China 's economic aggregates , the increase of the quality of economic growth , and further deepening of its financial and taxation systems , China has increasingly strengthened its financial ability to pay back its debts .  The state has an absolute ability to pay back its matured treasury bonds without causing a debt crisis .  
First , the reorganization and transformation of traditional industries should be put in an important position .  Traditional industries should be optimized and upgraded by means of quickening the change in the mode of industrial growth , increasing product variety , improving product quality , lowering energy consumption and other costs , adopting high and new technologies and other advanced and applicable technologies .  Second , it is necessary to develop high and new technology industries .  
The economic , legal , and necessary administrative means should be used comprehensively to shut down enterprises which produce goods of inferior quality , waste resources , cause serious pollution , and do not have production safety conditions ; eliminate backward equipment , technology , and techniques ; cut down on surplus production capacity , and prevent these enterprises from reviving .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
Although the " 17 August Communique limits the quality and quantity of weapons and notes that sales will be reduced , leading to " a final resolution " , this is based on the principle that Communist China will adopt a " peaceful solution " to the Taiwan issue .  If this basis is shaken or nonexistent , the United States will have sufficient reason to sell weapons to Taiwan according to the cross-strait military balance and Taiwan 's need .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
In order to actively meet the requirements of the new situation and tasks and earnestly master features and laws , on the basis of making sufficient study and argumentation , the Central Military Commission and PLA General Departments have staged a series of new policies and regulations focusing on improving educational quality , conducting troop training in science and technology , strengthening the cultivation of cadres , implementing socialized safeguards , improving the work style of leaders , and so on .  
Through the practice of 10 years , the whole army from top to bottom has formed such an understanding : To fulfill the general requirements of the " five phrases " , it is imperative to advance together with the times , regard " winning the battles " and " having no degeneration in quality " as the objectives and the improvement of the overall quality of officers and soldiers as a focal point , make unremitting efforts in laying foundations , and strive to initiate a new situation for the building of grass-roots units of our army .  
It is necessary to firmly establish the idea of strengthening grass-roots units by science and technology and prospering grass-roots units by talented people .  While improving the ideological and political , military professional , and physical and psychological qualities , efforts should be made to improve their scientific and technological quality .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan , as the quality of China 's agricultural productive force will be enhanced and the process of industrialization will be quickened up , we should seize the opportunity to implement an urbanization strategy , develop small cities and towns on a selective basis , actively develop medium - and small-sized cities , improve the functions of regional central cities , and enable large cities to exercise influence on areas around them .  
The meeting held : By successfully exploring a comprehensive way with Chinese characteristics for controlling the number of population and raising the quality of people , China has attracted worldwide attention on its achievements in population and family planning .  However , the country continues to face an enormous and arduous task in stabilizing law birth rates , and problems and difficulties in carrying out family planning work .  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
After our WTO entry , with the gradual completion of relevant policies and regulations as well as gradual improvements in the investment environment , we may be able to attract more foreign capital , new agricultural technology , superior varieties and management experience through the international market to improve our agricultural infrastructure , to heighten the level of our agricultural technology and modernized management , to improve the quality and output of our agricultural products , and to enhance the competitiveness of our agricultural products on the international market .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
and further enhance the quality of rural grassroots cadres and strengthen the cohesion and combat strength of the rural grassroots party organizations , so as to provide strong and effective ideological and organizational guarantee for making a success of agriculture and rural work .  In carrying out this work it is essential to strictly act in accordance with the principles , methods , and measures laid down by the central authorities , and pay particular attention to getting a good grasp of the following issues .  
The meeting held : By successfully exploring a comprehensive way with Chinese characteristics for controlling the number of population and raising the quality of people , China has attracted worldwide attention on its achievements in population and family planning .  However , the country continues to face an enormous and arduous task in stabilizing law birth rates , and problems and difficulties in carrying out family planning work .  
It is necessary to transform work style , practice the leadership accountability system , ensure that all work measures are in place , and gain new and marked achievements in public order work ; we must succeed in markedly lowering the crime rate , improving the public order precautionary setup , further strengthening the masses ' sense of security , markedly improving the all-round quality of the political-legal contingent , and achieving a big improvement in judicial backup work .  
The meeting pointed out : Rectifying and regulating the market economic order is an important measure to strengthen the work of social order , a pressing need to consolidate and develop the fine momentum of the national economy , an inevitable choice for improving the quality and competitiveness of the national economy , an essential condition for opening up yet wider to the outside world , a key move to establish and perfect the socialist market economic system , and an intrinsic demand for making full progress in social civilization .  
The meeting noted that economic order is an important symbol reflecting the operating quality of the national economy , the level of social and economic management , and the extent of legal system building , it is an important factor with an impact on economic development and social stability .  
The economic and trade commissions at all levels must fullyunderstand the important significance of rectifying and standardizing marketeconomic order from the high plane of intensifying the work of public order , solidifying and developing the good momentum of national economic development , heightening the overall quality and competitiveness of the national economy , further opening wider to the outside world , and establishing and perfecting thesocialist market economic structure .  They should further enhance their senseof responsibility and sense of mission , and ceaselessly strengthen theirinitiative and consciousness in work .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
The circular stressed : The trial of cases should guarantee that basic facts are clear , basic evidence is sufficient and reliable .  It is necessary to strictly guarantee that facts and evidence are fully verified , the legal procedures and the application of the laws are proper and sound , thus guaranteeing the quality of case handling .  
He died a heroic death to safeguard the motherland 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .  He loved the party , loved our Army , loved his work as a pilot , worked hard and practiced diligently .  He was an outstanding pilot with high political quality and professional proficiency .  
When selecting candidates , we should consistently adhere to the standards and strictly guarantee the political quality of those to be promoted .  Outstanding female cadres who can fully , correctly , actively implement the party 's basic line , persistently take the role of socialism with Chinese characteristics , can distinguish the right from the wrong on major principle issues , and can withstand tests at critical junctures should be selected and promoted to leading bodies .  
Second , greater efforts should be made to enhance the ideological and political quality of the new party members , education should be given to female activists who are striving to join the party .  According to the relevant stipulations for party member recruitment , concentrated training should be given to activists striving to join the party .  They should be organized to study the party constitution and the basic knowledge about the party so that they can adopt a correct ideal and belief and set aright the motivation of joining the party .  
In the wake of expanded market access , tariff reduction , and elimination of non-tariff measures , foreign products , services , and investment will enter the Chinese markets en masse , and the domestic enterprises will face even more intense competition .  The township enterprises , in particular , are marked by the inherent poor quality among many of them , as demonstrated by , one , some enterprises ' extensive management mode .  Their environment is filthy , chaotic , and inferior ;  
their internal system of rules and regulations is inadequate , their financial management is in chaos , their products are of poor quality , and their material and energy consumption is high .  They are marked by rampant tax fraud and evasion , theft and wastefulness , lack of safety measures , and reckless environmental pollution and other problems .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
We should correct the guiding principle of our tasks , make great efforts to eradicate unhealthy workings styles like bureaucracy , characterized by staying high above reality and soldiers , and formalism , characterized by pursuing unrealistic personal fame and working in a perfunctory manner , so as to improve the comprehensive quality of officers .  
Matters that can be taken over by society should gradually be handed over to society ; security organs with nonmilitary functions should be handed over to the localities , and security organs that shoulder military functions should be streamlined and augmented to create a new logistical security system with operating mechanisms consistent with the Chinese military 's quality construction and the western region 's economic development .  
However , in view of existing weak links in the plant 's quality control work , the Military Representative Office proposed to solemnly deal with the matter in order to strengthen the sense of the quality of military products among intermediate-level leading cadres .  Following careful consideration , the plant 's party committee finally decided to dismiss the director of a branch plant , who was in charge of the production of that product , from his post .

Water conservancy projects are very complex , systemic construction projects , requiring complete planning , comprehensive management , an emphasis on important points , guaranteed quality , and unceasing persistence in the work of flood prevention and drought resistance .  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
Beijing 's annual average volume of utilizable water resources is about 4.1 billion cubic meters .  Judging from the existing facilities and management level , this does not come up to the requirements for turning Beijing into an international metropolis and a city with first-rate environmental quality .  
As an important measure for structural readjustment , the Chinese government has canceled the protective prices of poor-quality-seed grain , such as southern early rice and northern spring wheat , encouraged the production of marketable , good-quality-seed produce , and increased the purchase-price difference according to quality .  
This year localities and departments will continue to pay close attention to state-owned enterprise reform , economic restructuring , scientific and technological progress , and internal demand expansion in accordance with the plan of the central authorities and strive to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy while further improving the quality of economic operation .  
The extent to which science and technology are applied and mastered in the military domain and the scientific and technological level of arms and equipment as well as military scientific and technological quality of commanders are the key symbols of army modernization .  How to take the strategy of building a strong army through science and technology as an important means of realizing army modernization ?  
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
Since reform and opening up two decades ago , Fujian-Taiwan trade and economic exchanges and cooperation have developed steadily , their quality and level have been constantly increased , and people-to-people and social and cultural exchanges have become increasingly frequent , initially bringing about a situation of economic complementarity and mutual benefit , mutual promotion , and common development .  
Member Gu Shengzu , who is also a vice mayor of Wuhan City , made a speech to analyze the harm and cause of the extra heavy burden of students of middle and primary schools .  He put forward suggestions on speeding up the pace of changing education from overemphasis in examinations to emphasis in quality and adopting various methods to solve the problem in a comprehensive manner .  
Therefore , the development of the country 's vast western region should be in line with the rule of the market economy , focus on the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and fully utilize the results of scientific and technological progress .  We should carry out a leap-frog-type development project , with a starting point higher than the one we had 20 years ago .  
By recruiting qualified personnel from the public and reinforcing its professional contingent , the government is bound to drastically alter its way of thinking , way of doing things , and service quality and this will give a forceful impetus to Hong Kong 's robust economic recovery and help turn Hong Kong into an international commercial metropolis .  
The continuous access of international environmental protection enterprises to China will bring along equipment with high technological contents and fine quality , which is of positive significance to enhancing the overall level of China 's environmental protection sector .  
Sun said : Owing to indiscriminate felling of forests , the soil erosion area along the Changjiang has risen to 0.74 million square kilometers or accounted for some 40 percent of the total area of the Changjiang valley and the solid wastes or discarded materials piled up along the Changjiang have posed a long-term threat to water quality .  
In agricultural production , on the basis of protecting the production capability of grain and other essential agricultural products , stress should be put on the optimization of varieties and the enhancement of quality and efficiency with a view to comprehensively optimizing crop varieties , painstakingly raising the quality of agricultural produce , positively developing animal husbandry and aquaculture , heightening the added value transformed from the processing of agricultural produce , and repeatedly increasing peasants ' income .  
Taking the conservation of energy , reduction of exhaustion , comprehensive utilization , and enhancement of environmental protection results by using new techniques and technologies as the focal points , we will expedite the technological transformation and equipment renewal of traditional industries and old industrial bases , speed up the elimination of outdated equipment and techniques , and reduce excess production capacity in a bid to narrow the gap with the developed countries in terms of production techniques , material exhaustion level , labor productivity , and the varieties and quality of products .  
Jiang Ying says that : In a short dozen years or so , in the area of patent legislation , examination , and institution building , China has done what took the developed nations decades or even a century to do , to the focus of world attention .  But since " our ability and quality in grasping and using patents remains inadequate , in contrast to the developed nations , we remain subject to a sizeable gap . "  
The main method to be used for this task is adopt sound environmental protection standards and technical norms and , based on these standards and norms , build a protective wall to ensure environmental protection and technological quality .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;

In terms of foreign trade and foreign direct investment , while enhancing the quality of products , scientific and technological contents , high added value , and market competitive power , we should continue to increase the export of some labor-intensive products , and occupy the international markets by practicing the strategy of lowering product prices by means of reducing labor costs .  This is of special significance to easing the current employment tension in China .  
The ideological and political building should be carried out with focus on this center , and the promotion of students ' ideological and political quality should always be given the priority .  Great efforts should be made to resolve the issue of ideal and faith so to form the spirit of devoting to the national defense cause .  Importance should be attached to the cultivation of sublime morality and the formation of characteristics unique for military personnel .  
Third , in the face of the mutual impacts of the various different ideologies and cultures in the world , it is not enough for us to depend only on the method of controlling the information flow ; and we must also improve the quality of socialist cultural products and give shape to a common ideal and a spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation in the whole society .  
It should actively propagate , popularize and promote advanced ideology and culture among the masses and develop a scientific , civilized and progressive ideological concept , way of production and way of life .  It should constantly enhance ideological and moral quality and scientific and cultural level of the whole nation and become the disseminator of China 's advanced culture .  
She indicated that real strength is the key in participating in international competition , and that improving real strength , such as developing industrial and agricultural product quality , invariably relies on science and technology .  
The main problems are : In some localities , the policy of unlimitedly purchasing peasants ' surplus grain at protective prices and quality grain at better prices has not been completely carried out , there are phenomena of restricting or refusing purchases and purchases by lowering the grade and reducing the price , and the continued decline of grain market prices has decreased peasants ' profits in growing grain and dampened their enthusiasm to a certain extent .  
The developed coastal areas and suburban districts of large and medium cities should proceed from their local superiority and give priority to the development of agriculture with fine quality and high efficiency as well as agriculture that earns foreign exchange .  
They have made positive contributions to controlling excessive population growth , improving population quality , and bringing population growth into line with economic , social , resource , and environmental development .  
refines and summarizes anew the Marxist points on the communist party 's advanced nature ; unveils the substance and implication of the communist party 's advanced nature from the high plane of the law of social development as well as the communist party 's intrinsic progressive quality .  In his exposition , Jiang Zemin makes it clear that : only when the party clearly understands the movement of the contradiction between productive forces and production relations , firmly acting as the representative of the development requirement of China 's advanced productive forces ;  
Over the past five years since the convocation of its third national congress , the Young Pioneers has closely centered its work around the overall work of the party and the state ; launched a series of varied and colorful activities in the light of the development demands of our time , including the activity of " hand in hand " and the " Operation Eyas of the Chinese Children " ; and has done a great deal of fruitful work in ensuring a healthy growth of children and enhancing the comprehensive quality of children .  
He emphasized that comrades working for the NPC must conscientiously and assiduously study Marxist theory and acquire various kinds of specialized knowledge in order to improve their ideological and theoretical quality and do their job with flying colors .  In particular , they must use Deng Xiaoping Theory and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " to guide the NPC 's work , ensuring that these are fully embodied in legislation , supervision and the decision of important matters .  
The General Office of the NPC Standing Committee began offering systematic training to NPC cadres at various levels in 1989 in order to meet the needs of the NPC 's work and make the training of NPC cadres a regular , institutionalized and standard practice .  More than 8,000 cadres have been trained to date .  This has given great impetus to the political , ideological and theoretical development of the ranks of NPC cadres and improved their vocational quality , and is an important contribution to the work of the NPC in the new period .  
Our current uncoordinated grain production and marketing structure is a very glaring problem , with a shortage of quality varieties , a surplus of popular and dependable varieties , a lack of adaptation to market demand , and the inability to sell at good prices being the key reasons for the grain selling difficulties and for peasants producing more but earning less .  
Through structural adjustment , we need to improve grain production in both breadth and depth , to convert from common varieties to quality and exclusive varieties , from the single production of grain to the overall development of grain plus diversified operations , and from simply providing primary farm products to developing the intensive processing of farm and sideline products .  
Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
Beijing Municipality in recent years has achieved new vistas in revolution and liberalization , and its economic development is flourishing .  The standard of living of the people has been steadily rising , and there have been many positive changes in the face of the city , with more parks , green spaces , and beautification projects being undertaken .  The city 's air quality has also improved , opening the way for some new weather phenomena there .  
Third , the government of the locality where the S &amp; T park is located must make a change in its role and enhance its service quality , do a good job in improving the S &amp; T park 's supporting facilities , environment , communications , social order , cultural and sport facilities , basic education , public health , and social security , thus cultivate favorable conditions for the development of the park .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that to build our party well , we must , in the first place , help our party 's leading cadres at all levels improve their ideological and political quality .  Particularly we must strive to help the middle-aged and young leading cadres improve their ideological and political quality so that they will become a new generation of statesmen who remain loyal to Marxism and unswervingly adhere to the socialist road with Chinese characteristics , and are capable of running the party and the country .  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
Thoroughly and correctly implementing the legislation law , further strengthening government legislative work , improving the quality of government legislative work , and safeguarding the unity of the socialist legal system is an important responsibility of the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments , and is also a major task in the building of the government legal system .  
The circular demands that through implementing the legislation law , the local people 's governments concerned and the State Council departments should further standardize government legislative activities , improve the quality of government legislative work , and thus spur government legislative work to express still more comprehensively and accurately General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on the " three represents , " so that government legislative work , execution of laws , and supervision of execution of laws can rise to a new level .  
We should attach great importance to the work , lay stress on key issues , work perseveringly and unremittingly , be practical results-minded , ensure that work is done in a down-to-earth manner , and ensure that leading bodies of public security , judicial , and procuratorial departments are truly strengthened and the overall quality of cadres and policemen is notably improved , so that they can more effectively perform the mission entrusted to them by the party and people .  
He said that to promote national defense in future , we must " carry out nationalization of the armed forces , establish modern and highly-efficient military strength for national defense , conduct streamlined training for war , increase the combined combat-effectiveness of the three armed services , improve quality , improve welfare , and establish the dignity of the national troops . "  
Through international cooperation the Chinese science and technology community has extensively learned advanced scientific research theory and management methods , enhanced its research and development capabilities , and improved engineering and product quality . and has also gained good economic and social returns ; at the same time , they have also made their own contributions to the development of modern science .  
On the other hand , nine-year compulsory education should be promoted in a comprehensive manner .  Reform of the curriculum should be deepened and efforts should be made to set up extracurricular activity bases and science museums to cultivate the scientific knowledge and innovative awareness of secondary and primary students , and promote quality education .  
Hu Jintao , member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee and vice president , stressed during a recent inspection trip in Tianjin : Strengthening the building of urban communities is a natural requirement of a well-coordinated economic and social development in cities ; and is also of a great significance to deepening reform , promoting the country 's economic growth , improving the quality of life for the masses , maintaining social stability , and consolidating the ruling position of our party .  
Between 15 and 20 June , in the company of Zhang Dejiang , secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial CPC Committee , and Chai Songyue , governor of Zhejiang Province , Li Lanqing mainly inspected basic education , vocational education , higher education , and scientific research in Wenzhou , Ningbo , Shaoxing , and Hangzhou . He also held meetings with representatives of the educational circles to discuss issues on deepening educational reforms , comprehensively advancing quality education , orienting education to serving local economic and social development .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the construction of recreational facilities for young people , resolutely ban electronic game rooms , singing and dancing parlors , and video show rooms which have a harmful impact on the growth of youngsters , and mete out more severe punishments to those who run such unhealthy undertakings , thus creating a benign social environment for the comprehensive implementation of quality education .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
This responsible person stressed that based on the high or low quality level of the military cadres selected from general high level universities , speaking in a definite sense , their level of quality impacts the entire level of military development and the success or failure of our undertaking .  
Over the years , the broad masses of judges and other judicial personnel of courts at the grassroots level have made continued efforts to increase their efficiency and quality in handling cases .  They have satisfactorily accomplished trial and implementing tasks .  They have made contributions to safeguarding social stability , promoting economic development , and ensuring that the broad masses of people can live and work in peace and contentment .  
In accordance with the requirements of Chairman Jiang 's " Two Armings " , the entire military , on the basis of conducting ideological theoretical arming , has put great efforts into strengthening modern science and technology arming , especially arming with high technology knowledge , actively transforming concepts , adjusting work thinking , and putting the focus on cultivating personnel , creating talent , and comprehensively raising the quality of officers and soldiers .  
Over the past year , facing the complicated and ever-changing international situation and fierce international competition , the company , while having straightened out its internal relationships and striving to enable its new system to work effectively , has continued to raise the level of astronautical development and applied itself to improving quality , enabling it to successfully launch satellites and to test fly large astronautical vehicles .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
The increase in domestic and foreign demand stimulated comprehensive improvement in the production sector and enabled China 's entire economy to develop toward a good orientation .  The quality of economic performance improved steadily .  
Meanwhile , all levels of government must also do whatever they can to build a greater number of venues and facilities for healthy teenage activities . "  We must fully push ahead with quality education and provide vast numbers of teenage students with a fine social environment for growth .  In order to do that , we , with the consent of the Party Central Committee and the State Council , now issue the following circular on relevant issues on strengthening the building and management work of venues for teenage students ' extracurricular activities :  
It was learned that the age limit for various leading posts set by the party Central Committee this time is mainly to make cadres younger and more intelligent and raise the quality of the ranks of cadres .  In the mean time , it is designed to enable new cadres to receive promotion earlier and encourage leading cadres of various units to adopt new thinking in their administration .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
The key to building spiritual civilization lies in always grasping the work with perseverance and having it effectively carried out .  Specifically speaking , it should be carried out for the all-round elevation of the people 's quality among all social organizations at the grassroots level .  
Li Mingyu , a standing committee member , noted : the implementation of the strategy of ruling the country by law is demanding higher and higher standards for the quality of judges and procurators .  Placing stress on the academic requirements on judges and procurators , the current amendments have addressed just to the right issue , which suits the need for development of the legal system in our country .  
Some standing committee members stated that it is justified to set higher requirements on the academic qualifications of judges and procurators .  However , the quality of judges and procurators should not be reflected in their academic qualifications alone .  Examination only reveals professional standards , whereas other factors , such as political integrity and vocational ethics , can only be assessed by practical work .  
In this connection , Chang Shanna , a standing committee member , asserted : as far as the personal quality of judges and procurators is concerned , the key factor lies in their political integrity and ideological understanding .  So , in the revision of the two laws , stress should be laid on the academic requirements , and importance should be attached to the improvement of overall quality as well .  
The central authorities repeatedly stressed that the rate of progress should be subordinated to quality .  Stressing the importance of the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) is , in essence , determined by the specific important position of counties ( cities ) , and by the condition of the leading bodies and the rank of leading cadres at this level .  
The law on farm seeds adopted at this meeting is of great significance in protecting and using seed resources , standardizing the breeding , production , management , and use of seeds , protecting the legitimate rights and interests of seed breeders , producers , managers , and users , improving the quality of seeds , promoting an industrial management of farm seeds , expediting agricultural development through science and technology , and promoting the development of crop farming .  
The existing main problems are a low overall standard of product quality , a low ratio of up-to-standard products in a considerable number of categories , the persistent act of producing fake and shoddy products in defiance of repeated bans , and the poor work in supervising and regulating quality .  
Although in each case there are objective and subjective reasons , these cases have something in common : They developed during exceptional times under exceptional conditions , and if they do not pay close attention to improving their quality , they very easily become swell-headed and make wrong decisions .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
Moreover , since Taiwan bought advanced weapons from many countries and their quality , function , and operation procedures vary from country to country , the fire control system , electronic warfare system , and command control systems of the weapons are mostly uncoordinated or imperfect .  This has a direct bearing on the normal performance of the planes ' fighting function .  
In the new historical period , departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried out reform at a deeper level , quickened development , readjusted their structure , laid a more solid foundation , improved quality , ensured supply , striven to raise their technological level and increase their ability to ensure supply , and ensured the comprehensive fulfillment of their tasks in the development of new products and in their cooperation in production .  
Following the international custom , the PBOC branches organized more than 50,000 man-trips to inspect the quality of assets and genuine profit and loss of more than 38,000 financial institutions ( including branch offices ) in order to promote the improvement of internal management of commercial banks .  
In the first half of this year , the state requested iron and steel enterprises to continue to curtail the products in oversupply and increase the products in short supply .  The state also took forceful measures to attack the inferior quality rolled steel for building purposes and closed down 225 small steel plants .  
In the first half of this year , state-owned and state holding enterprises in Liaoning registered a steady increase in profits , and the quality of the overall economic operation improved significantly .  There are three main reasons for this : First , key enterprises have maintained a relatively high level of profits and played a comparatively strong stimulating role .  
It is necessary to build a contingent of ideological and political workers who are politically strong , professionally competent , highly disciplinary , and upright , according to the requirements of improving quality , optimizing the structure , and integrating full-time workers with part-time workers .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that protecting and improving the ecological environment and improving the environmental quality is an important task that must be accomplished in developing the western region .  
The expanded domestic and foreign demand has brought an overall production improvement , with industrial operating quality markedly improved .  It is understood that over one-half of the losing large and medium state-owned enterprises [ SOE ] and state-owned stock-control or holding enterprises have now overcome their difficulties .  
To guarantee the quality of maritime training , the Nanjing Military Region organized leaders of all units to check the areas scheduled for maritime training and formulated careful training plans on the basis of comprehensively mastering the regular weather patterns , the morning and evening tides , the sea currents , and the characteristics of beaches and coastal sea beds .  
Chi Haotian emphasized that we should unswervingly uphold the absolute leadership of the party over the army , vigorously strengthen the ideological and political building of troops , earnestly study Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , earnestly study a series of expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin , resolutely implement President Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents , " continue conducting the " three stresses " education in a profound way , enhance the ideological and political quality of officers and soldiers , and keep the political color of our army forever .  
Internal management were improved and enhanced in most enterprises for the purposes of lowering costs , improving quality , and enhancing economic efficiency .  This has also played a major role in freeing the enterprises from business difficulties .  
and it is also the requirement of speeding up the improvement of ethnic quality and promoting the joint progress of all minorities .  At present the cultural level of the masses in Tibet is not high , a large proportion of adults in the rural and pastoral areas are illiterate , and it is necessary to rely on and use the Tibetan language to popularize scientific and cultural knowledge , improve labor skills , and enrich the people 's cultural life .  
Another weak point of the Taiwan military is that it purchases weapons from a variety of countries ; their quality , performance , and operating regulations differ , with the result that it is very difficult to form the weapon systems into a complete perfect set , and this has a direct impact on taking advantage of their combat capability .  
The report believes that although the Chinese communists ' military threat against our troops has changed from mere advantage in quantity to competition in quality , leading to a disparity between the two sides of the strait and the Chinese communists are eager to settle the " Taiwan issue , " thus imposing a greater threat to our security , both sides of the strait should still create conditions for cooperation with goodwill , jointly deal with the issue of " a future China , " and seek a win-win result on the basis of mutual trust .  
Many comrades have even given their precious lives !  However , when measured by the standard of the requirement of the " three represents , " our police contingent still lags far behind in terms of its political , ideological , and professional quality , as well as in its discipline and work style .  
Qiu Xueqiang , director of the Political Department of the Supreme People 's Procuratorate , said : In conducting the " three kinds of education , " we should focus our attention on improving the quality of the procurators ' ranks as a whole , especially their ideological and political quality , so that they will become a force that is united with revolutionary ideals and conviction , that will unswervingly subordinate itself to the interests of the whole , and that is brave in fighting and will not worry the party re any degeneration .  
The selection of the chief justice will be conducive to building a contingent of high quality judges and establishing a scientific judge system .  According to open , equal , competitive and selective principles , outstanding judges of high quality will be selected and appointed as the chief justice .  
The chief justice will receive a special allowance according to the regulations and special consideration in time of promotion .  The system can thus create favorable conditions for enabling high quality judges to be discovered and become eminent .  It will fully whip up the working enthusiasm of all judicial personnel , enhance their interests in work and sense of responsibility , and also have a positive influence on improving the quality of all judges .  
In short , the work of institutional reform is proceeding in an orderly manner in various areas .  The focus of the next step of reform is to vigorously proceed with the institutional reform of the cities , counties , and townships , changing functions , optimizing personnel structures , reducing fiscal and peasant burdens , and improving work efficiency and service quality .  It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and study and to get well prepared for work in all areas .  
The constant improvement in the quality of science , technology and culture of cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups , and the constant increase in the sense of democracy and the legal system and the expansion of the spiritual civilization will create a favorable investment and development environment for developing the western region .

Facts have proved : The Chinese Government is right in adopting the active fiscal policy ; that the results obtained from this active fiscal policy of floating more national bonds and invest the money in building more infrastructure projects are remarkable ; and that building more key projects and pooling the resources on building some large projects that China wanted to build but was unable to build can help economic restructuring , improve the quality of economic growth , and improve enterprises ' economic performance .  
" We lack a group of leading talented people who are capable of leading and directing in global science and technology , and we lack a large number of high quality operational and managerial talents who are familiar with market economic law . "

"  
Making agricultural adjustment is not to decide which crops should be emphasized and which crops should be less emphasized .  We should raise the quality of agricultural products in an all-round way , improve geographical layout , and realize sustained development and a coordinated development between urban and rural areas .  
Fifth , we should more effectively promote and spread major practicable farming techniques , enhance the quality of farm produce and the comprehensive agricultural efficiency , thus providing technological support for restructuring .

It is necessary to act according to the guiding principle of widening the field of vision , extensively selecting talented people , promoting exchanges , optimizing structures , intensifying training , enhancing quality , strengthening management , perfecting supervision , and basing ourselves on reality , but having our eyes on the future to strive to build up a high-quality contingent of diplomats stationed in foreign countries which can meet the needs of the new century and new tasks .

They not only improved the status of Chinese Americans as a whole , but many of their children have made brilliant accomplishments .  
I would like to express my personal appreciation of the two books I requested when subscribing to the magazine , In search of Photo Past ( , ) which offer the western reader beautiful , realistic and moving pictures of Taiwan life , the quality of which has seldom been equaled in photographic publications .  
The economic takeoff is helpful for raising the quality of culture . But from another angle , some people believe that the roots of culture in Taiwan are weak . Sudden wealth at this time is by no means an unmixed blessing . This is especially true with the percolation of a " get rich quick " attitude into the arts , which will do even more to erode the roots of cultural development .  
Excellent personnel quality has always been the strongest point of our national defense . During annual recruiting for the combined forces academy , the proportion of enrollees for the navy is usually the highest , which underlines the quality standards required by the navy . In recent years however the numbers seeking admission to military school have fallen steadily , with the navy feeling the bite more than the other forces because of its reputation for the hard life .  
What impressed me most about the museum was not only the amazing collections , the good preservation , the quality of the abundant publications or the nice the tea-room and garden ; I spent a lot of time talking with the museum staff , even going to the store rooms to see and discuss various items with them . I felt that it was these people who were really the showcase . Young and educated in Taiwan , it seemed that every one of them had more than one foreign language .  
Their fine work requires great expenditure of time : An experienced tailor can make only one or two a day . Depending on the quality of materials , the labor costs for a ch'i-p'ao can range anywhere from NT $ 3,000 to NT $ 6,000 . If one adds a border or embroiders such patterns as clouds of good fortune or a ju-yi , an S-shaped jade ornament , it can easily run in excess of NT $ 10,000 . Up against cheap and convenient mass-produced clothing , the ch'i-p'ao naturally does n't stand a chance . "  
It 's worth pointing out that two years ago , when Yuan Liu participated in the world 's largest children 's book exhibition - - the Bologna Italy book fair - - they won the competition for the prize for " Best Children 's Illustrated Books " with two Chinese folk tales for children , Gumiya and The Giant and the 12 Suns . You can see from this that as far as Taiwan 's children 's books are concerned , there is not far to go in terms of raising quality .  
Although there are those who ardently hope that the entry of the corporations will promote the progress and renovation of Chinatown , many are concerned that the competition of big capital will only make the traditional enterprises , with their thin resources in both capital and talented manpower , even less capable of fighting back . This in turn will cause the gap between rich and poor in Chinatown to grow and will cause a deterioration in the quality of life and environment for inhabitants , perhaps even forcing people into crime .  
Moreover , products mined or gathered using explosives , drilling and digging have more fissures , the colors are not uniform and the quality is low , so the prices are also inferior . Besides , most of the rock gets smashed and lost , so that only ten or twenty percent is actually worth keeping .  
It 's Not a Battle Between Ecology and Development ! : Huang Ta-pang , who has worked in the PBM for over 40 years , states that the marble now imported from Italy , which has excellent color , superior quality , and few cracks or fissures and is easily processed , is already the finest available material . And it is n't expensive . The costs of mining in Taiwan are high , and even if you just figure in the best mines , it is still impossible to compete .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
For example , the Lungshan Temple in Lukang could be listed as a world class artifact . The quality of the construction , the interior environment , and the primitive construction have all been preserved rather well . In particular , having National Heritage Award winner Wang Kun-shan 's nan-kuan troupe inside gave the old temple real vitality ; I really loved that .  
As an example , Den Chi-fu , a professor at National Chiao Tung University , cites India , which has strong basic science , produces many Ph . D.s and far exceeds us in the number of papers published in international academic journals , but which has been unable to raise the quality of life of its citizens , where the electronics industry has been developed for decades without ever getting off the ground and where many airports are still not computerized . . . . "  
The National Science Council 's Twelve-Year Plan for Scientific and Technological Development identifies its four main goals as upgrading science and technology , advancing economic development , raising the public 's quality of life and establishing an independent national defense .  
In the past , scientific and technological development was clearly aimed at increasing our per capita income , but now that the economy has taken off , " raising the quality of life is the most pressing task at hand , " says Ma Nan-hsien , director of planning and evaluation at the National Science Council . The proportion of resources devoted to environmental and medical research , such as developing better waste processing technology or setting up a National Health Research Institute , will constantly increase .  
In particular , the influence of applied science on technological development has led to increasing global polarization - - countries with advanced science and technology are becoming increasingly wealthy as they turn out products with high profit margins , leading to greater economic growth and improvements in their quality of life , while countries that are weak in science and technology have had to spend a correspondingly greater amount in exchange for them , leading to sluggish economies and poorer living conditions .  
But if in the long term the good quality of cultivated fruits is to be guaranteed , then they will still have to rely on the occasional improvement from wild varieties . It is thus that the bat remains an animal of crucial importance for the fruit harvest of Southeast Asia . Eating 3,000 insects an evening : On average , 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the tropical rain forests , which are also home to 90 percent of the world 's animal and vegetable species .  
Lee Tung-liang , a Changhua County Councilor and a leader in the anti-Dupont environmental movement , says that if the water quality does not improve he is thinking about calling on the farmers to let all their land go to waste , and appeal to the county magistrate . " But , that would probably be very hard , and I 'm afraid it would n't be easy to get a positive response from the farmers . "  
After painful lessons , the palmtop computer alliance mapped out by the Computer and Communications Research Laboratories last year made a major shift in its structure . First the number of companies was greatly reduced . At present there are only nine . Moreover , all the technical work , from materials purchasing to the design and quality control of the main board to the certification of the keyboards , is to be divided up among the participating firms .  
Because people have greater contact with the outside world and easy access to information and because everyone , particularly the middle class , is paying increasing attention to quality of life , when people see that consumer goods in Taiwan are of low quality and high price , they seek happier shopping grounds abroad . This is one method of obtaining more reasonable consumer quality .  
There are fewer and fewer kids coming along each year now : Two years ago the school still counted 37 heads , with 24 remaining last year , and only an even dozen this year . It 's hard to run a school without students : Leaving aside for a moment the question of economic efficiency , in terms of the quality of instruction , what impact does the small number of students have on learning ?  
The dig report from that time pointed out that there were two cultural levels at the site . The pottery discovered in the upper layer had writing , and brass implements had also been unearthed , so that layer seems to be from the Chou dynasty . But the lower layer was entirely from a stone tool culture . The black and light yellow pottery that was found was innovative in shape and of very high quality in technique , meaning that it must have been " an important stage in high antiquity . "  
Because he had chosen ophthalmology he took up a highly self-disciplined lifestyle He forced himself to strictly abstain from smoking and drinking , avoid anger , lead a settled , regular life , maintain a placid frame of mind , and not even to pick up heavy objects , so as to avoid any physical or mental imbalance which might make his hands unsteady and thereby affect the quality of his treatment of people 's eyes .  
" For a country to be strong , it relies not on powerful weapons , but on high quality people , " says Lin Wan-yi . Tp raise the quality of human capital , besides education and technology , raising the level of culture and guaranteeing social security are very important .  
Is the protagonist 's betting fervor a kind of heedless indulgence or a momentous choice of all choices ? Lest we forget , too much emphasis on such sticky and unanswerable questions runs us the risk of overlooking the comic quality that runs through the entire piece .  
On the other side of the bridge , the road climbs an embankment and approximately one hour later enters a tunnel and passes through to the quintessential stretch of road skirting the Chulu Cliffs . At a height of 770 meters above sea level , the view is astonishing and vast ; the quality of the road is excellent .  
The last generation faced problems getting by day to day , therefore they only ask that life be stable and they are satisfied . In this generation , we are into social competition and improving the quality of life , so our expectations of life are very different , " says Yeh Chu-lan . Her father wanted her to go back to their hometown after she graduated from college to teach and live a quiet life . But for her a challenging , stimulating , diverse life was much more attractive .  
His works are first baked unglazed at 1200 . Such a temperature is perfect for effecting a warm , smooth , touchable quality . lf the temperature were higher , the clay would be far too hard ; at a lower temperature , the clay would crumble . After his pottery is fired unglazed , it is smoked with firewood . Then he chooses a complementary material derived from a natural element , such as metal , wood , stone or glass ( representing water ) to combine with the pottery .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
Most proprietary teas on the British market are made from a variety of raw or processed graded teas which tea merchants buy from different Indian and African plantations or at tea auctions , and which are then carefully mixed and combined in varying proportions by professional blenders to create branded teas of stable quality , in flavors such as Earl Grey Tea , Breakfast Tea , Prince Charles Tea and so on .  
The people of Meinung powerfully expressed their point of view : " The site of the reservoir is only 1.5 kilometers away from Kuanghsing , and the dam is as big as fifty 100-story skyscrapers set side by side . In terms of being suitable for a reservoir , the soil which the dam would be based on is of the lowest quality . It 's soft and loose , and it wo n't hold up . And safety is a major concern . "  
But beautification and weight-loss is anextremely complicated and personalized process . Another variable is the uneven quality of the many new operators who have sprung up to meet the demand that has come along with economic prosperity , and there are traps everywhere . There are operators who put out a lot of different hooks to catch a wide variety of unsuspecting consumers .  
The quality of the performances put on by all these professional and amateur groups and individuals ranges from the appalling to the excellent , and audiences can pick and choose just as at a flea market . Around 10% of the fringe performances are special enough to have a chance of returning in a few years ' time as part of the official program .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
The panda , the focus of world attention , may have difficulties getting pregnant and generally weak propagation abilities , and its powers of adaption may have declined and its population aged ; but man , by threatening the bamboo forests and destroying its natural habitat so that it has less space to forage , is even more the cause of its demise . The Formosan landlocked salmon , regarded as a national treasure , lives only in the upper stretches of the Tachia River , where the temperature is low and water quality high .  
Wu was ahead of her at school , so she has witnessed his long-term development . Back in school , Wu was a well-behaved child with a special classical quality to him . Then Chung saw him dancing in a loin cloth for the Cloud Gate Dance Theater , establishing the experimental Contemporary Legend Theater , and acting in movies and on television . His creative ability and experience made her feel that he was the best choice for Ah-Q .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment . Thus , I decided to come back to Malaysia to set up a children 's creative learning program . The main objective is to cultivate quality of thinking in children when they are still young .  
What is considered most important in Ami singing is vocal mastery based on practical experience , with physical feelings and shared emotions as the starting point , and a basic quality of harmony . The surrounding environment is also an important influential factor .  
Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had . Enterprises need not think that their only choice is to head abroad .  
Former EPA director Jaw Shau-kong recently drew up a list of " seven major problems " behind the Shihmen Reservoir 's poor water quality and heavy silting . But only one-the adverse natural geology-is a " congenital defect . " The rest are all " acquired dysfunctions . "  
Several years ago it reached Fuhsing Rural Township to the north . Along the Northern Cross-Island Highway , the air turns cold early in the year , and this brings forward the harvest season of New Century pears , California plums , California honey plums , honey peaches and even kiwi-fruit . Thanks to the abundant sunshine , the quality of the fruit far surpasses that of other areas , and with Taiwan 's largest consumer market , Greater Taipei , close at hand , sales from the area have gradually taken off and overtaken Lishan .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
One of the more extreme examples often cited is that of the nearby Philippines , where university education is very common . Nevertheless , even the Filipina maids who come to work in Taiwan have university diplomas , thus wasting the talented manpower of that nation . How should the quality of human labor be synchronized with economic development ?  
In early December of last year , the Public Television Broadcasting Law was first placed on the Legislative Yuan 's agenda , and the legislators started discussing its every provision . Those legislators who support the law say that the TV programs we currently have are hardly up to snuff . The ones to be blamed for Taiwan 's questionable quality of culture are commercial TV stations . In order not to let Taiwan 's programming be devoured by alien pop culture , we need a public television station to produce high-quality shows .  
Many people , regardless of how they feel about classical music , recognize that raising the " quality " of the nation is something that begins within people themselves . We must now simply wait to see what sort of reactions will be stirred by this encounter between the mass medium of radio , and the refined realm of classical music .  
He also described a demonstration of a sword 's quality : at one stroke it cut clean through 10 large nails hammered into a wooden upright of a building , yet its edge was quite undulled . With an effort the blade could be bent almost double , but when released it snapped back as straight as a bowstring .  
I believe that the problems that a family living in our crowded urban society must face in regards to the quality of living environment , educating children and economic pressures have already made us weary and incapable of patience when we must face situations within our families or in the outside world . What is more , jagged wounds have been left behind in our spirits and our bodies .  
Professor Huang Ping-huang of the Department of Education at National Chengchi University ( NCCU ) also believes that initiative is the quality most lacking in today 's primary and middle school teachers : " They are so accustomed to eating instant noodles that they have forgotten how to cook . "  
ROC naval planning assumes that the PRC is the most likely enemy . Considering Taiwan 's defensive strategy and the limits on the tolerable defense budget burden , the ROC is aiming for a force that will be " small in numbers but high in quality . " The maritime component of such a force must be able to deal with threats from the air or from the surface or sub-surface of the ocean ; it is also responsible for maintaining a credible amphibious capability .  
A military gap ? Professor Chung has considerable confidence in the current naval forces of the ROC . He says that , leaving aside nuclear weapons , Taiwan 's maritime defense level , including ships , weapons systems , and personnel quality , is ahead of the PRC by 10 to 15 years .  
There is a stereotype that says that Central American workers are less dedicated , or at least less malleable , and it is true that strikes often occur . But Chen , who began working at a garment factory doing the most basic work at the age of 17 , has a keen eye for worker quality . He uses different incentives in different places to improve the efficiency of his workers . His high level of productivity is now a model for other garment producers in Nicaragua .  
Music critic Wang Hen only partly agrees with this assessment . He thinks Wong is a quite outstanding conductor , and that this year in particular he raised his game a notch . Moreover , his ability to coordinate each section of musicians is rare indeed ; otherwise it would be impossible to bring together musicians from different places , of different ages , and with different habits , and produce a quality sound in only a short rehearsal period .  
Liu Ming-lung , secretary-general of the Environmental Quality Education Foundation , notes that wet paddy field has a number of useful environmental functions , including stabilizing flow volume in rivers , absorbing excess in times of heavy rains and floods , improving water quality , reducing soil erosion , and improving air quality .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
Kaohsiung 's major source of running water comes from the Kaoping River , but agricultural pollution ( both in the form of pesticides and livestock waste ) and illegal dumping of garbage have seriously eroded the quality of Kaoping River water , which has received low water-quality designations for several years running .  
Starting in 1984 , this group was able to harness the collective energies of government and industry to promote and complete more than 10 public works projects , and through corporate self-awareness and community supervision were able to gradually improve the quality of the environment . After 10 years of hard work , the city had completely remade itself and become a model of urban renaissance .  
ATM leader Shen explains that some of the land in the reclamation area is of poor quality . The soil is very rocky , making planting of paddy rice difficult , so the land must be cleared to a depth of at least 20 centimeters . Though large stones can be dug up with heavy machinery , small stones have to be removed by hand as they are uncovered during plowing .  
Judge Tsai decided that while medical service is not a product per se , it is intimately connected to public health and safety . The stated intent of the law she applied is to " protect consumer rights and interests , promote consumer safety , and raise the quality of life for domestic consumers . " On this basis , the judge decided that the law also applied to medical care .  
Few people know of those researchers like Dr . Green who have quietly toiled for many years at Taiwan 's one and only international organization , the AVRDC . Together these agricultural experts from around the world have developed today 's improved cherry tomatoes , soybeans , and Chinese cabbage . They have raised the quality of Taiwan 's fruits and vegetables , and helped innumerable farmers in Southeast Asia , South Asia , Africa and Latin America raise their incomes and improve their nutrition .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
Taiwan is by no means unique in encountering a growing number of elderly following rapid economic gains and improvements in the quality of medical care . The experiences of the advanced industrial nations in confronting these problems can serve as a reference for us , but we still need to do some basic homework : carrying out surveys about the different elderly age groups here and achieving general recognition of these problems and a consensus about how to deal with them .  
Of course , the quality of nursing homes is very uneven , which accounts for much of seniors ' unwillingness to live in them . Yet at a basic level seniors still hold traditional notions about children caring for their parents in old age , and feel that they will lose face and a sense of security if they are apart from their children . Children , meanwhile , bear similar psychological and social pressures . Indeed who , if sufficiently able , would choose to " drop " the care of one 's parents onto institutions ?  
Most of the plants used by Taiwan 's herbalists come from mainland China . This makes both the supply and the quality unstable because the same plant grown in different regions , or under different weather and climatic conditions , will produce different medicinal effects . This makes necessary the use of biotechnology in the artificial cultivatation of Chinese herbal medicines .  
By paying for each procedure carried out , NHI is encouraging the medical community to emphasize quantity rather than quality of treatment . It is also encouraging doctors to go into easier fields which pay well . For this reason , dermatology , pediatrics and physical rehabilitation have become hot areas to work in , and doctors are leaving hospitals to set up their own private clinics . On the other hand , more difficult areas of medicine such as surgery are suffering from a shortage of doctors .  
As economic conditions and the quality of life have improved , people today naturally value life far more highly than in former times . For instance , although chickenpox usually produces only mild symptoms , it is potentially crippling or even fatal . Old people still believe that the earlier a child gets chickenpox the better , but despite the high price of the chickenpox vaccine now imported from America , many parents are willing to have their children immunized .  
ISO 14000 is a set of management standards intended to encourage firms to build environmental management systems . This means protecting against pollution , making economical use of resources in the production process , manufacturing green products and working to improve the quality of the overall environment by making continuous efforts to improve every aspect of their production processes .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
Twenty years ago Shiatzy presented an improved chi pao . Influenced by the film The Last Emperor , ten years ago they created an awe-inspiring imperial effect using Qing style beadwork and embroidery , silks , satins and velvets , in brown , gold and purple colors . This year Shiatzy are using cotton and linen with hand-drawn designs to create a Zen-like poetic quality .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .  
Besides her natural vocal quality , the key to A-Mei 's success has been that her songs reflect feelings and aspirations of her era . In fact , when you look back at the history of popular cultural interchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait , all the most successful singers and hit songs have been connected in some way to the hopes and feelings of the times .  
While the star school phenomenon is not something that can be changed overnight , the pecking order among middle rank schools is already growing blurred . If high schools work together to raise the quality of education , perhaps the star school syndrome will just fade away on its own .  
This accounts for the lustrous , vibrant quality of the tricolor glazed pottery of the Tang dynasty ( 618-907 ) , though the fact that tricolor pottery was fired at less than 1000 _ C meant it was prone to break . Also , the finished works differed widely from each other depending on the quality of the clay , the type of glaze , the temperature and even the kind of chimney in the kiln . At higher temperatures , for example , the glaze lost its fluidity .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
Likewise , any temple worth its salt expects to receive offerings of a certain aesthetic standard . In Buddhist music too , there is a range of quality , ranging from the superb to the dire .  
The relentless march of development is putting tremendous strain on the ecosystems of man-made ponds in Taoyuan . The pond shown here , located in Three Lakes Village , has been divided in two . One half is being used to raise fish , which has ruined water quality in the other half and killed off all the aquatic plants that had been growing there .  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
Dong enjoys enthusiastic support from the local community , which has provided him with generous financial assistance , manpower , filming locations , and more . The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
It does n't seem to require any great wisdom to have a bright and clean store with fast-food service , but when you link this simple product together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control , the result has swept the globe . Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work to expand the company 's territory while the headquarters takes 0.5% of operating revenues as its share for as long as the franchise lasts .  
Teng , well known for directing high-quality television dramas , is set to direct CTS 's next big drama . Though hopes are high , Liu says that Taiwanese television stars still need to be nurtured carefully . He notes that productions in Taiwan tend to be low budget , with poor scenery , lighting , and mediocre acting quality .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
The head of the team , Wang Chao-yi , points out that the high quality pebbles found underground in the Kuanyin alluvial plain have been disastrous as idle farmland has drawn illegal gravel mining , and the gravel pits have then been used as landfills , leaving behind a ravaged landscape . Since 1994 , residents of Paochang Village in Kuanyin Rural Township have been trying to protect the environment by blocking off coastal roads to gravel and garbage trucks . Unfortunately , new problems keep cropping up .  
Lin Jingquan , a graduate of a national music academy in Fujian Province , edited the lyrics of many gezai xi librettos , making them both colloquial and elegant at the same time . He devised a new cadence , and tied the vocal music more closely to the characters and plots . His efforts greatly improved the quality of gezai xi and helped bring about the great flourishing of gezai xi that was to occur in the 1960s .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
But this rare catch of a pregnant shark also confirmed how late whale sharks mature , and showed that in their reproductive strategy they prefer " quality " over " quantity . " In today 's age of unbridled exploitation of ocean fisheries , this does not bode well for the survival of whale shark populations .  
It is a pity that , although Taiwan has attained democracy , it has yet to rationalize its public sector . Instead it is increasingly a " street vendor " culture , with fractious grassroots movements here and there , or just plain vulgar . This points to the necessity of us following the path of advanced nations and upgrading our domestic services . Taiwan must create a quality environment in which people want to live .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
In recent years , the AVRDC has also stepped up the economic evaluation of its projects , to assess the socio-economic benefits of improved vegetable varieties and growing methods . One of the major reasons for setting up the AVRDC was the hope that it could promote the cultivation of vegetables of a high nutritional value , to improve the nutritional status and quality of life for the people of many developing countries , and promote those countries ' overall national development .  
Apart from uneven levels of quality , the main reason why alternative medicine is not welcomed by the regulatory authorities or mainstream medical practitioners is that it is difficult or impossible to test the effectiveness of alternative treatments by scientific methods .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
The steel is then pounded and ground into a shape roughly approximating that of the eventual blade . This process is repeated 36 times to be absolutely sure the blade will stand up to severe punishment . After the steel has been through smelting , heat treatment , hammering , and cooling , the metal is deliberately exposed to the elements to test its quality . The rusted blade is then subjected to a beating , and will be thrown away if it ca n't withstand the punishment .  
Against this backdrop , how to augment the quality of the second track is currently being hotly debated in the field of vocational education . The technical and vocational education infrastructure has undergone major changes over the last few years . Vocational high schools have been reduced in scale and become increasingly unclear about their role , while senior technical colleges have begun to resemble standard universities , with many actually choosing to upgrade to university status . With such developments the sector has increasingly given the impression of being on the verge of collapse .  
Pots made from blackish ash-colored clay are also few in number , but they too have some special characteristics . The jars and vases have small mouths and big bellies .

However , Professor Chen Kuan-jeng , a demographer at Chang Gung University 's Department of Healthcare Administration , thinks that the lowering of the birth rate in those years was not necessarily the result of a successful family planning policy , but rather due to the fact that as medical science advanced and infant mortality receded , people no longer needed to have as many children . With economic growth people also tended to dedicate themselves to making money and improving their material quality of life , which naturally resulted in a declining birth rate .  
As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
HUF chairwoman Mary Chen points out that Taiwan 's traditional business groups have put economics first , neglecting an environment-friendly business culture , which does cause worry . However , through monitoring and testing mechanisms , compost content and quality problems can be reduced to a minimum . This is a direction that many environmental groups will be pursuing in the future .  
Although this winter Mingcheng 's Murcott production was not very high , the quality was excellent .

Member States are urged to make commitments to and to support , through their national institutions , the continued gradual establishment of the Global Ocean Observing System ( GOOS ) , building on the existing systems so as to form a globally coordinated strategy to secure sufficient information for adequate management , forecasting and periodic scientific assessments of the state of the marine environment ; the information produced should be comparable ( i.e . quality controlled ) ; 
The lack of adequate basic services , a key component of shelter , exacts a heavy toll on human health , productivity and the quality of life , particularly for the urban and rural poor .  
The quality of life of the people depends , among other economic , social , environmental and cultural factors on the physical conditions and spatial characteristics of our villages , towns and cities .  City lay-out and aesthetics , land-use patterns , population and building densities , transportation and ease of access for all to basic goods , services and public amenities have crucial bearing on the livability of settlements .  
Chapter 7 of Agenda 21 developed the concept of an " enabling approach " in the human settlements sector , whereby a partnership among the public , private and community sectors sought to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and the rural poor .  
National , subnational and local policies and development plans must be carefully re-examined to ensure optimal land use and geographically better balanced economic development , including the protection of indispensable agricultural land ; land that sustains biodiversity , water quality and groundwater recharge ; fragile areas , including coastal areas ; and other sensitive areas in need of protection . 83 bis .  
Health problems related to adverse environmental conditions , including a lack of access to safe water and sanitation , inadequate waste management , poor drainage , air pollution , and exposure to excessive noise levels , as well as ineffective and inadequate health services , exact a heavy toll on the quality of life and the overall contribution to society of millions of people . 
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Dispose , within both rural and urban areas by the year 2025 , of all sewage , waste waters and solid wastes in a manner in conformity with national or international environmental quality guidelines ;  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
As stressed above , criteria and indicators defined at the national level are aimed at improving the quantity and quality of information available to decision makers and the general public about progress towards sustainable forest management , and thus to assist in the policy and decision-making process ; the ultimate aim in this regard is to further improve forest management practices over time .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
Whatever their geographical scope , however , issues such as depletion of natural resources , declining food production , and declining availability and quality of water were linked with issues such as income generation , literacy , health care , unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in the developed world , privatization and the effects of structural adjustment programmes , international trade patterns , and the foreign debt burden .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets , and the relationship of national manufacturers to their government , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
In view of the strong international competition in automobile markets and the relationship of national manufacturers to their Governments , effective action needs to be taken at the international level to develop more effective and stringent regulatory frameworks , such as internationally agreed standards for air quality , motor vehicle emissions and fuel economy , at least among OECD countries .  
In recent years , faced with a continuing decline in the quality of the environment , many Governments have adopted stronger environmental policies , enacted fresh legislation and regulations , and reorganized and expanded administrative agencies .  Special governmental departments for the environment , which have regulatory and promotional roles , have been set up in developing countries ( for example , India ) .  
First world environmental standards are becoming increasingly stringent and have moved from regulating obvious pollutants such as sulphur dioxide ( SO2 ) , to controlling , for example , the quality and quantity of industrial wastes , the transboundary shipment of hazardous wastes , acid mine drainage , and heavy metals releases .  
Recognizing the need for effective government and efficient public administrative services to be responsive to the needs of the people , to ensure universal access to quality services and productive assets and to create an enabling environment for sustainable development and provide quality services ,  
Reaffirming the importance of promoting cooperation among all countries in enhancing the quality of public administration , including , inter alia , the promotion of a participatory approach to development , the provision of basic social services , the development of policies to eradicate poverty and the establishment of an enabling environment for economic growth , social justice and sustainable development ,  
Noting that improved efficiency in government requires strengthened and efficient public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the economy and the civil society and the provision of quality services ,  
Recognizing that effectiveness of government requires an efficient and effective public administration in all countries that is responsive to the needs of the people , promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable people-centred development ,  
To improve the quality of the analytical , organizational and administrative support to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs , its subsidiary bodies and intergovernmental conferences dealing with international drug control so as to facilitate their effective functioning ;  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
A reorientation of the activities of the human settlements sector , which resulted in major changes leading to the consolidation and reduction of activities relating to technical aspects of human settlements , which were addressed in the past , in favour of activities that better complement other activities undertaken by the three other leading sections responsible for the implementation of activities that focus more on improving the quality of life from several angles ;  
Notwithstanding the fact that issues pertaining to the improvement of the quality of life are indivisible and interdependent and will , therefore , be addressed in an interdisciplinary manner in so far as possible , the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Social Development Issues and Policies Division , will seek to achieve objectives related to four specific yet complementary areas pertaining to the improvement of the quality of life : population , human development , advancement of women and human settlements .  
Reducing the adult illiteracy rate - the appropriate age group to be determined in each country - to at least half its 1990 level , with an emphasis on female literacy ; achieving universal access to quality education , with particular priority being given to primary and technical education and job training , combating illiteracy , and eliminating gender disparities in access to , retention in and support for education ;  
In this area , special attention must be paid to the challenges inherent in improving the quality of services and strengthening social integration through the organized participation of civil society in the formulation of policies and programmes and in control over their management .  
The meeting was convened to pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services over an ambitious but realistic time period , by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery .  
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
To ensure that the proper mix of permanent , temporary and contractual staff and adequate technological resources are available so that documentation produced in all six official languages is of high quality and is issued in a timely fashion , in strict observance of the resolutions and rules establishing language arrangements for the various bodies and organs of the United Nations ;  
Two maternal and child health / family planning projects , implemented by UNRWA in coordination with local Palestinian non-governmental organizations , made considerable progress in improving the quality of antenatal care and providing postnatal care .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education will require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nation 's need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
Construction specialists consulted since have confirmed that the prevailing circumstances posed enormous challenges , and have acknowledged that it is a remarkable achievement that UNDP completed these premises with commensurate quality for the funds expended .  
This degree of importance becomes even more obvious as one realizes that water is a natural resource which is scarce and limited and whose quality has repercussions in the ecosystems of which it is the core , thus capable of harming the living conditions of both present and future generations .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
During its sixteenth session , in January 1996 , the Council decided to give priority , in its future activities , to regional and subregional projects , and reaffirmed its support of projects aiming , in particular at improving the quality of communication for development ; promoting freedom of the press , pluralism and independence of the media ; promoting democracy and human rights ; supporting activities for broader participation of women in the media ; and developing community media etc .  
The meeting was convened to express a mutual commitment and pursue a common ambition to achieve universal access to basic social services by reorienting existing and mobilizing additional resources as well as increasing cost-effectiveness , efficiency and quality in service delivery . 
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
We must note with deep concern the delays , particularly in the areas of the quartering of UNITA troops ; the selection of soldiers for incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces ( FAA ) ; and the slow process of the transfer of UNITA commanding officers to join the FAA , as well as the handing over to UNAVEM III of insufficient quantities of weapons and the poor quality of those handed over , and the continued presence of UNITA police .  
In his special report , the Commissioner-General draws attention to the critical state of UNRWA 's finances , the serious structural deficit facing the Agency , the austerity measures already taken to reduce the deficit as much as possible , the impact of the measures on the quality and level of services to Palestine refugees and the implications of the reduction of services for the stability of the area .  3 .  The Commissioner-General held an extraordinary meeting of major donors and host Governments in Amman on 23 September 1996 .  
On his part , the Commissioner-General intends to review existing operational structures , re-examine the planning assumptions underlying budget preparation and rationalize further budgetary allocations so that the structural deficit can be dealt with while maintaining the quality and level of the Agency 's basic and essential services .  
The Administrator , emphasizing the perpetual resource dilemma that UNDP faced of having to plan and programme project activities over several years , based on a system of annual voluntary contributions , provided his personal assurances of continuing to pay close attention to minimizing the balance of resources by maximizing delivery , without compromise to programme quality and focus . 
Endorses the establishment of a global contraceptive commodity programme , to be managed by the United Nations Population Fund , and funded with an initial capitalization of $ 5 million , as set out in paragraph 23 of document DP / FPA / 1996 / 3 , as an integral component of the overall work of the Fund in strengthening reproductive health programmes , including family planning and sexual health , and emphasizes that these activities should be monitored carefully to ensure that they adhere to technical standards of safety and quality ;  
It is perceived as encompassing the principle of universality in health care , so that all human beings may live with the knowledge that they can seek health care which is accessible , affordable , relevant , and of the requisite quality .  
Health security covers all aspects of the right of every individual to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health , including the right to food in sufficient quantity and of good quality , the right to decent housing and to live in environments where known health risks are controlled , and the right to have access to education and information on health , rights that are enshrined in the various international treaties .  
The Universal Postal Union ( UPU ) assisted the postal administrations of the countries concerned , mainly in modernizing their organizational structures and in improving the quality of their service to the urban and rural communities they serve .  
It is further recognized that such improvement of the quality of emission data , in addition to improving the transparency and comparability of national emissions inventories , also improves knowledge of the relationship between global emissions and resulting atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases , and therefore aids significantly the task of estimating the emission limitations or reductions required to achieve a given concentration level of greenhouse gases , the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .  
The Advisory Committee notes that , as stated in paragraphs 7 and 13 of the report , roving finance officers can be drawn for temporary assignment from existing resources either at the Department of Peacekeeping Operations or the Department of Administration and Management so far as there are sufficient staff resources in their respective departments , services or units to allow them to leave temporarily the functions they carry out without detriment to the quality and delivery of those functions .  
The widespread incorporation of information technology in production and communications has considerably reduced the physical size of factories ( by increasing the versatility of machines , thereby lowering the number of machines required for different sequences of operations ) , expanded the variety of jobs that can be performed , and improved the precision in production and quality control that can be achieved by a worker , and ( through instant information connectivity ) greatly enhanced intra - and inter-firm spatial networking to maximize location-specific advantages .  
By investing in both capital and human resources , attaching special importance to raising the quality of basic and specialized education , the development of work skills , professional training and improvement of qualifications ;  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , particularly primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
the experience gathered by the Division through its long _ standing technical assistance programmes ( such as ACIS , ASYCUDA , Trade Facilitation , Trade Points , as well as its direct and broad range experience in training human resources in island and land-locked countries for example ) has constantly underlined that , whatever the quality of technologies , the human factor is the essential ingredient for success .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health care programmes , including sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and that attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
Among other issues , the use of modern satellite telecommunications technology for supporting a range of services such as telephone , distance education and health-care services and the attendant improvement in the quality of life in remote and rural areas was demonstrated .  
The environmental policy sought to reconcile economic development with natural resource conservation and to make the high quality of the environment a key element in supporting the country 's economic and social development .  
In order to provide enterprises with incentives to adopt innovative measures to promote female employment , a special award was established in 1993 at the initiative of the Ministry of Labour and Employment to reward those enterprises which have taken action to increase the participation of women in the labour force , improve the quality of female employment , develop their potential , including through the strengthening of programmes to provide education and vocational training , and eliminate or counteract the negative consequences in women 's work .  
The concept of health security encompasses all aspects of the basic rights to health : the right to freedom of choice and personal security ; the right to food in sufficient quantity and quality ; the right to live and work in environments where known health risks are controlled ; and the right to have access to education , information and decent housing .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper entitled " Our Future Homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
Revisions were made to improve data quality in the following items : ( i ) data on " children ever born " and " children living " should be collected by sex ; ( ii ) " date of birth of the last child born alive " was introduced to replace " live births within the 12 months preceding the census " to measure current fertility ; and ( iii ) " deaths in the 12 months preceding the census " was added to measure current mortality .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
In an exciting new development , the International Federation , non-governmental organizations , church agencies and the ICRC which between them are the end-point deliverers of some 95 per cent of international humanitarian assistance have come together to develop a second-generation code which will lay down minimal performance criteria for independent agencies and will define , for the first time , both a universal best practice for agencies and the quantity and quality of assistance disaster victims have a right to expect from assistance agencies . 
Armenia hopes that this special session will take decisions to further integrate environmental and social concerns into the day-to-day regulatory tools of the international economy , and thus ensure that quality of life issues are addressed in a way more likely to lead to their successful resolution .  
Specify the expected benefits in terms of generating more robust results by addressing issues , such as the adequacy of the sampling design , the choice of aggregation methods , the treatment of quality differences and technologically advanced products , the balance between exercising expert judgement and applying scientific statistical methods , and other issues of concern .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
Principal bottlenecks in making productive use of this progress involve harmonized access and adequate , explicit quality control of available information , and limited access in developing countries , in particular the least developed countries .  
Moreover , the Programme of Action is committed to improving the quality of life by focusing on three interdependent goals : reductions in infant , child and maternal mortality ; expanded access to education , particularly for women and girls ; and universal access to primary health care , including reproductive health and family planning services .  
Similar expectations also exist for the quality and quantity of information and contributions made by the major groups themselves : in the next phase , their inputs will need to be more accurate , unique and reliable , while their organizational structures will need to be increasingly transparent and accountable .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
Taking measures - no matter how good they may be - will not suffice ; such measures must be backed by concrete actions demonstrating the political will to crush all discrimination and to improve the study conditions of students and the living conditions of teachers , especially in this transitional period of declining teaching quality and school attendance , as well as of failure to recognize the importance of the teacher 's function ( the level of remuneration is so low that many are abandoning that noble profession ) .  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
While viewing with interest the extensive delegation to non-governmental organizations of delivery of certain support services to children and their families , the Committee considers that the ultimate responsibility for the quality of such Government _ supported services rests with the State party - be it at the central or local level - and that delegated programmes need careful monitoring and evaluation .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
It is a dynamic long-term process , including economic and social development as essential elements , seen in perspectives that may change over time , and leading to improved quality of life for all human beings , the eradication of poverty and the reduction of inequality .  
The development of future large water-supply systems must adopt pricing that reflects all external costs , including waterlogging ; salinization ; habitat alteration ; impact on endangered species ; long-term deterioration of water quality due to changing land-use practices in catchment areas ; cultural and social dislocation ; and the cost of imposed risks .  
While some requested an improvement in quality in public rather than private schools , maintaining free public education at the primary level , others favoured a more liberal policy environment with competition between the private and public sector .  
WWhat are the lessons to be learned from BITs as regards increasing the quantity and quality of investment flows and advancing sustainable social and economic development in host developing countries ? 
The active involvement of women at the national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health ; in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
These agreements constitute a starting point for a hemisphere-wide position on sustainable development - the cornerstone of a cooperative alliance among the States of the Americas in their common search for a better quality of life for their peoples , based on integrated , mutually reinforcing economic , social and environmental objectives .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
Operationally , the UNIDO work programmes were based on the following thematic priorities : formulation of strategies and institution-building for global economic integration ; innovation , productivity and quality to increase competitiveness ; industrial information , investment and technology promotion ; human resource development with special attention to the integration of women in industrial development ; rural industrial development ; and industry-related environment and energy issues .  
Whilst a sound and stable macroeconomic and microeconomic policy was essential , basic transport , power and telecommunications infrastructure were identified as the most important physical elements , coupled with mechanisms for encouraging investment in the processing industries , for promoting the provision of export credit and trade finance , for ensuring the control of product quality and for building managerial capacity .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
Improvement in the overall quality of both primary and secondary education would require tackling the internal inefficiencies in the existing system and improving services in keeping with the nations need for an educational content responsive to the changes occurring in the national market economy .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
At the World Conference on Education for All and the World Summit for Social Development , Governments committed themselves to ensuring universal access to quality education , attaining the highest possible standards of physical and mental health and ensuring access of all to primary health care .  This should include efforts to rectify inequalities relating to social conditions , race , national origin , age or disability , and between urban and rural areas .  
On the contrary , the provisions of the Constitution , the Federal Education Act , which is the result of participation by organizations and sectors representing the entire national community , and the strategic guidelines it has drawn up in this regard are designed , on the basis of equity , to encourage broader educational coverage and quality at all levels and for all sectors of the population , particularly the most underprivileged .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Competitiveness , the need for technological upgrading , a focus on style , quality , design and timely delivery : none of these elements found their way into traditional adjustment programmes , where it was automatically assumed that comparative cost , in the form of cheap labour , would be sufficient .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
While the quality of United Nations programmes in the field of science and technology for development had improved , the question of how to bridge the gap between those countries that generated and utilized new scientific ideas and modern technologies , and those countries which were unable to do so remained one of the major challenges facing the international community .  
Success criteria will be measured in terms of the number and quality of business plans prepared and implemented , an increase in the number of viable and profitable small - and medium-scale enterprises and people employed , and a continuous rise in the levels of investments recorded .  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
This entails conducive macro and sectoral policies , as well as a transparent and simple regulatory framework ; provision of necessary infrastructure ; improved access to credit , technology and markets ; extension services geared towards improving product design and quality of goods produced ; and support services for improved linkages with other sectors of the economy .  
That would lead to improved aviation and marine and maritime safety and efficiency , agricultural productivity , forest and range management , weather forecasting for the public , environmental quality and understanding of the climatology and climate variability .  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
The Government 's overall objectives for housing have been set out in a White Paper , entitled " Our future homes " ( 1995 ) and these include increasing the number of owner-occupied homes , reducing significantly the population of homes lying vacant and transforming the remaining large-scale , poor quality public estates through public and private sector partnership . 
The quality of the future to which humankind aspires depends on what we can do today to give human beings their dignity and guarantee that they can enjoy the fundamental rights recognized in the international legal instruments that reflect our collective conscience .  
Ethnic and religious intolerance , the policy of ethnic cleansing and the acts of barbarity that accompanied events in the former Yugoslavia are a deeply tragic and very relevant warning about the quality and solidity of our civilization on the cusp of the twenty-first century .  
These actions have strengthened the role of the University and allowed for alternative ways of improving quality of living , achieving sustainable development and contributing to the progress of less developed cultures .  
The quality and level of relations Algeria has developed in this connection in recent years with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , both in the area of bringing its two experimental and radioisotope-producing nuclear reactors into the safeguards regime and in the area of technological assistance and cooperation , clearly illustrate my country 's decisive commitment to the Agency 's objectives and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
Under a successor project , " Sexual behaviour and reproductive health and fertility regulation " , the ECE secretariat is currently completing the archiving of the standardized Fertility and Family Survey data files along with the work of standard tabulations , which will ensure that the data are internationally comparable , of high quality and easily accessible to researchers .  
The lack of sufficient and reliable data on water availability , its use and quality in many areas of the world makes effective national , regional and global water resource assessment difficult , if not impractical .  
The World Summit for Social Development ( Copenhagen , 1995 ) and follow-up processes have recognized the priority of improving access and quality of basic social services in eradicating poverty .  The " 20 / 20 initiative " seeks to increase funds for social investment through reciprocal agreements in which developed and developing country partners allocate 20 per cent of ODA and 20 per cent of national budgets respectively to basic social services by the year 2000.14 Implementation of this commitment would represent a significant step forward .  
The persistence of current trends in a number of critical issues , according to the Conventional Development Scenario and other leading " business-as-usual " projections , will lead to continuing poverty and declining quality of life in some developing regions , especially in urban areas , increasing competition over use rights to natural resources and worsening environmental degradation .  
This scepticism has sprung from a variety of sources : that high unemployment represents a voluntary economic equilibrium that is impossible to reduce without triggering off accelerating inflation ; that rapid labour-saving technological change has ushered in an era of " jobless growth " and " the end of work " ; and that heightened economic competition in the wake of the globalization of the world economy has emasculated the capacity of Governments to influence the level and quality of employment .  
While the need for improved information is recognized , the actual trend in the quality and quantity of data and information being gathered and exchanged is decreasing owing to the impact of economic constraints , particularly but not only in developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and , often , the lack of real priority accorded by Governments .  
The active involvement of women at national and international levels is essential for the development and implementation of policies aimed at promoting and protecting the environmental aspects of human health , in particular , in setting standards for drinking water , since everyone has a right to access to drinking water in quantity and quality equal to his or her basic needs .  
Many NGOs have demonstrated an ability not only to serve segments of the community that are difficult to reach , such as adolescents or women living in poor communities , but also to provide high quality services , to work in inaccessible or sensitive areas and to test innovative approaches .  
While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .
