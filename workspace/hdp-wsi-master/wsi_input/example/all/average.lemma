The land area of the western region accounts for more than half of China 's total , with the arable land accounting for 27.7 percent and grassland three-fifths of the country 's total .  The annual average amount of water resources accounts for 46.6 percent of China 's total .  Together with the abundant sunlight resources , the western region has become China 's major cotton , flue-cured tobacco , fruits , flowers producing bases .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .

But over the years , Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] has repeatedly provoked the " one China " principle , kept trying to solicit foreigners ' support , and hugely increased military spending for armament development .  Since the 1990 ' s , the national defense spending has grown by an average of 6.94 percent , with over $ 12-billion actual budget per year .  Over $ 40-billion has also been invested in purchasing weaponry , in a vain bid to " resist reunification with force " , which is , in reality , an idle dream .  
Ever since the 1990 ' s , China has been developing its maritime resources .  The output of maritime industries has been growing 30 percent annually on the average , and this year 's output will account for 5 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product .

A group of universally recognized cadres who have both ability and political integrity and made outstanding administrative performances have clinched their leading posts by means of competition .  All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .

The party 's line and policy concerning cadres should be fully and properly carried out , and the established standard should be strictly complied with in selecting and promoting young cadres .

Li Baodong pointed out : According to this strategy , the Chinese Government will appropriate huge amounts of funds for developing infrastructure facilities and basic industries in these areas , thus keeping the economic growth rate in these areas higher than the national average .

This means each 100,000 yuan increase in capital only increased employment by 1 person .  This equipment level is comparable to the Chinese industries ' current average equipment level , and the trend is for the level to rise year after year .  The private economy 's labor-intensive characteristic is fast eroding .

As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
Taipei City was the earliest jurisdiction to implement multiple channels of entry for high schools . Many high schools adopted new criteria for admission , including recommendation , weighting of particular classes , a second round of testing ( oral or written ) , or calculation of the overall junior high school grade point average . However , various observers accused Taipei of " raising entry standards arbitrarily and encouraging elitism . " Thus , this year these methods will all be discontinued .  
First , while average global temperature is rising , warming occurs at different rates and in differing degrees depending upon location . For example , the large " body " of the ocean is similar to that of an adult human in that it does n't easily become " feverish . " Land , on the other hand , more closely resembles a small child that catches a fever at the mere mention of the word .  
Consequently , over the last 100 years , the poles have seen an increase of 5 �X C in their average temperatures . Hence accelerated melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is one of the first symptoms of global warming . But climate can not be separated into discrete regional units .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
Sister Therese says women spend varying amounts of time in the Good Shepherd center . During an average two-week to three-month stay of an urgent case , the social workers first try to get an understanding of the new bride 's background and situation . They then give some " emotional first-aid " to put the women at ease . Finally they focus on the particularities of each individual case and offer assistance .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
NTU 's impressive influence has continued for half a century and remains as robust as ever . As Lin Ku-fang-chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at Fokuang University 's College of Humanities and himself a Taida grad ( in archeology ) - reminds us , " The importance of National Taiwan University is not in that today it still has the highest average test scores among incoming freshmen of any school in the country , nor that it enjoys political influence and gets huge amounts of money from the government .  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste . As for the disposition of collected kitchen waste , " 70% is used primarily for raising pigs , and composting accounts for 30% , " says Lin Tso-hsiang , section chief for kitchen waste recycling operations at the Environmental Protection Administration 's Bureau of Environmental Inspection . During the current phase , local governments have not been required to institute kitchen waste recycling ; they are merely encouraged to do so .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
Roan Ching-yueh , well-known writer and architect , has commented that Taiwan architects are often high above the crowd , separated from the average person by an unbridgeable gap , but the works of Chen Shih-liang " exhibit a desire to make a very friendly connection , " and foster a genuine , enjoyable conversation between those who study the aesthetics of architectural space up in their ivory towers and the people who actually use architectural space . The pictures in his books almost equal the text in volume and afford the reader a unique reading experience .  
Conservative estimates indicate that in urban schools , each classroom sees on average two or three emotionally disturbed students or students coming from problem families . " I 've even seen students who have sold sex on the Internet , and others who have been sexually abused in their own homes ! " says teacher Li Man-yun of Taipei 's Peicheng Junior High School . Indeed , such issues are beyond the professional capacities of teachers , and call for the assistance of social service agencies .

All this has generally lowered the average age of middle-ranking cadres in various city party and government organizations .  The educational level and the overall quality of these cadres are notably raised .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .

Moreover , the New Taiwan dollar has been allowed to appreciate by more than 40 percent against the U . S . dollar since 1985 ; and private individuals can now buy as much as US $ 5 million for outward remittances .  
Although fiercely competitive , this channel of selection and replacement assists in social integration . ( 2 ) A gradual increase in the average level of education and expertise of elected officials has helped increase the efficiency and capability of the political system . ( 3 ) Native Taiwanese have a comparatively better chance of serving in public office through elections , while mainlanders often pass through other recruitment channels .  
It is planned that by the 1993 academic year , the number of teachers per class will have risen to 1.5 , and this standard would be maintained until the turn of the century . As to class size , it is hoped that it can be reduced from the present average of 43 students per class to an average of 40 students per class by the year 1993 , with further reductions thereafter until the number will have been reduced to 35 students per class by the year 2000 .  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street . It was thought that plutocratic influences or the pressure of interest groups might prevent real " grass-roots " opinions from being expressed ; so opinion polls were developed .  
The Department of Education has already planned to spend 20 percent of its budget on improving the government primary and junior schools in Taiwan Province . Apart from this we want to aid private schools to raise the average educational level .  
The salary of a locally born maid is about NT $ 20,000 , while the average for a foreign national is only about NT $ 15,000 , " points out an executive-level professional woman employed in a foreign corporation , who has hired both local and foreign-born help , " and besides , these days only middle aged grannies are willing to work as domestics in Taiwan , and they are very selective themselves , and have a lot of demands like vacation or raises . "  
This is especially the case in the main area of human settlement east of the Central Mountain Range , the Hua-Tung ( Hualien-Taitung ) Valley , which is a mere three to seven kilometers wide . Taking the Sanmin area for example , within 8.4 kilometers to the west , the land rises from 500 meters above sea level to 3,300 meters , or an average of a rise of one meter for every three meters west that you go .  
But if in the long term the good quality of cultivated fruits is to be guaranteed , then they will still have to rely on the occasional improvement from wild varieties . It is thus that the bat remains an animal of crucial importance for the fruit harvest of Southeast Asia . Eating 3,000 insects an evening : On average , 70 percent of the oxygen we breathe comes from the tropical rain forests , which are also home to 90 percent of the world 's animal and vegetable species .  
According to estimates of the scientific community , before a chlorine atom becomes inactive , its " power " is enough to destroy 10,000 ozone molecules . Add to this that mankind has continued to release vast amounts of CFCs into the atmosphere , and it 's no surprise that in the past few years the average ozone content at every latitude has fallen between one to ten percentage points . Further , at present the rate of loss is increasing 2-3% annually .  
Moreover , in this situation Mei Lanfang had high expectations for his favored youngest son . But owing to the fact that he himself often went abroad to perform , he absorbed some Western influence . He understood that he should use a patient and gradual method to educate his child . Also , unlike the average opera teacher who is always ready to strike his pupil , he never made Mei Baojiu come to detest the pressure and quit .  
Among the 34 special government projects commissioned last year , a total of 274 domestic and foreign patents have been won . That is on average a patent coming out every 1.3 days .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .

The dense primeval forest surrounding the lighthouse at that time was cleared , and today has been replaced by an open meadow . The average tourist is n't allowed to go to the top for a look-see , but you can use your mind 's eye to gaze past the rifle slits , dry moat , or artillery emplacement , and see something of the arduous challenge of the initial settlement period .  
The section chief of the division for agricultural weather forecasts , Liu Fu-cheng , nicknamed " the old turtle , " has known Jen Li-yu for thirty years as classmate , fellow conscript , and colleague . He laughingly commented on the fact that Jen Li-yu was a mild-mannered civil servant , always meek and always humble . But because the timbre of his voice was clear and resonant , far more so than the average , he gained enormous popularity .  
When employers cut and runThe method of calculating severance pay is that workers are entitled to receive one month 's average wages for each full year worked .

The imposing Presidential Palace 's forbidden places are no longer unapproachable . The Presidential Palace does not combine working space and living quarters as do the White House or Buckingham Palace , which can reveal markedly different styles of interior design through the deliberate arrangement of chambers and gardens by the successive occupants . Nevertheless , for the average citizen , the Presidential Palace holds its own unique charisma .  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
But as the eviction deadline approached , some core figures changed their positions . They no longer opposed the compulsory relocation and agreed to accept a compensation formula which came out to an average of about HK $ 200,000 ( just over US $ 25,000 ) per household . As the situation took a dramatic turn , the attitude of the Hong Kong government also hardened . Some Committee members suspect that within their own group there may be some individuals colluding with the Hong Kong housing authorities to make a fast buck .  
The complete extinction 65 million years ago of the dinosaurs - - the subjects of unlimited imaginings of us latter-day creatures - - was a seemingly calamitous and tragic event which left no survivors . But in fact the average rate at which the dinosaurs died out was equivalent to one species every thousand years . Even if humans had been alive at the time , we could not easily have observed the course of their demise .  
Developing countries can not be expected to have the depth of accumulated research of say , the data going back 100 years on average for every trout and salmon species in Europe and America , or one rare British species of lycaenid butterfly which has been researched for thirty or forty years , or researchers in the mold of the British entomologist R.H.L . Disney , who has spent 25 years completing over 100 papers about " scuttle flies , " which most people have never even heard of .  
Hsu Yi-hsiung , the head of the graduate physical education program at National Taiwan Normal University , is unequivocal in stating that foreign research shows that children who are physically active and athletic are highly creative and more intelligent than average .  
It can be seen that a multitude of factors affect textbook selection , and that underneath lies a struggle involving power , gain and values . Many of the underlying processes are unknown to the average person , with power and its application being the most important hidden factors .

The average political commentators at the time seemed to be engaged in political discourse , admonishing the leaders of the country and serving as a mouthpiece for the people but , in actual fact , they were passing judgment based on some simple Confucian ideas of morality .  
Liou has advertised the " baby oil series " as being free of complex or obscure meaning , taking it on frequent tours to rural areas in an effort to bridge the gap with audiences and make modern dance more accessible to the average person .  
Mike Moritz , a partner in the American venture capital firm Sequoia Capital , was one of those making presentations at a venture capitalists ' forum held by the Monte Jade Science and Technology Association in the southern Bay Area in September of last year .

He says that , in the end , what is actually required to clinch a deal is a person who is familiar with both sides involved .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
Urbanization has also made interactions between people more complex . Some of the psychological problems of modern people are not like those of the past , which were comprehensible to the average person . For this reason , more people have been going to see psychological counselors over the last few years . The numbers of people waiting to see a doctor in the psychiatric wards of hospitals or at institutions which provide psychological care provide ample evidence of this .  
Market numbers tell the story . The privately-operated CGMH , which is the largest health-care organization in Taiwan , opened its first TCM department , fully staffed by doctors with dual backgrounds in both TCM and Western medicine , at its Linkou medical center two years ago . The number of patients seen by its out-patient clinic has grown explosively to its current level of around 25,000 per month , an average of approximately 1,000 per day .  
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface . The huge trade surplus built up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into Taiwan . The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 . Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT $ 71,800 per ping ( about 3.3 square meters ) in 1986 to NT $ 284,500 per ping in 1989 .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ? Meanwhile , between early 1996 and late 1999 , the annual return of the weighted index of the Taiwan stock exchange ( Taiex ) was 17% , or more than triple a one-year certificate of deposit .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
As Kung analyzes the situation , traditionally banks made their income from the differential between the interest paid on deposits and interest earned on loans ( this is called the " interest rate margin " ) . However , with competition as intense as it is today , banks have had to offer higher interest on deposits and lower-interest loans , so that over the last three years the differential has been , on average , only about two percent . It is virtually impossible for a bank to cover its operating costs with such a narrow margin .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
Taipei City was the earliest jurisdiction to implement multiple channels of entry for high schools . Many high schools adopted new criteria for admission , including recommendation , weighting of particular classes , a second round of testing ( oral or written ) , or calculation of the overall junior high school grade point average . However , various observers accused Taipei of " raising entry standards arbitrarily and encouraging elitism . " Thus , this year these methods will all be discontinued .  
First , while average global temperature is rising , warming occurs at different rates and in differing degrees depending upon location . For example , the large " body " of the ocean is similar to that of an adult human in that it does n't easily become " feverish . " Land , on the other hand , more closely resembles a small child that catches a fever at the mere mention of the word .  
Consequently , over the last 100 years , the poles have seen an increase of 5 �X C in their average temperatures . Hence accelerated melting of the Antarctic ice sheet is one of the first symptoms of global warming . But climate can not be separated into discrete regional units .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
However , hopes are one thing , but reality is another . According to the analysis in the survey report , the number of children hoped for or considered ideal by married women with a college-level or better education , and by employed married women , is on average greater than two . But most are unable to fully realize their childbearing hopes or ideals , because of the high cost of raising children in terms of mental and physical energy , material resources and opportunity cost .  
A shortage of workers will push up wages and thus be bad for exports , or else it will be necessary to import large numbers of foreign workers , which will bring about social change and may give rise to many social problems . The combined effect of falling birthrates and increasing average lifespans is to accentuate the problem of population aging .  
When dengue fever was attacking southern Taiwan , the average health center in a rural township had only five employees . But communities there are spread widely and it required a great deal of time and personnel to visit each and every community and inspect outdoor containers of standing water , destroy carrier mosquitoes , and spray disinfectant .  
A survey conducted in Kaohsiung County showed a clear rising trend in the number of domestic violence cases reported by foreign brides . Before 1998 the number of such reports was in the single digits . After 1998 there was a yearly increase such that by the end of April , 2001 , there was a monthly average of seven reports .  
Sister Therese says women spend varying amounts of time in the Good Shepherd center . During an average two-week to three-month stay of an urgent case , the social workers first try to get an understanding of the new bride 's background and situation . They then give some " emotional first-aid " to put the women at ease . Finally they focus on the particularities of each individual case and offer assistance .  
Professor Lin Wan-i of National Taiwan University 's Social Work Department points out that a third of all foreign brides under the age of 20 tend to be physically , emotionally and socially immature . They are on average three to five years behind their Taiwan counterparts educationally . Not only is their own competitive advantage low , it adversely affects the rearing of their children and creates the problem of continued weak competitiveness for the next generation .  
NTU 's impressive influence has continued for half a century and remains as robust as ever . As Lin Ku-fang-chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at Fokuang University 's College of Humanities and himself a Taida grad ( in archeology ) - reminds us , " The importance of National Taiwan University is not in that today it still has the highest average test scores among incoming freshmen of any school in the country , nor that it enjoys political influence and gets huge amounts of money from the government .  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste . As for the disposition of collected kitchen waste , " 70% is used primarily for raising pigs , and composting accounts for 30% , " says Lin Tso-hsiang , section chief for kitchen waste recycling operations at the Environmental Protection Administration 's Bureau of Environmental Inspection . During the current phase , local governments have not been required to institute kitchen waste recycling ; they are merely encouraged to do so .  
" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island . They have little knowledge of the length and breadth of the mountains and are unable properly to understand the development of Taiwan 's ethnic and cultural diversity .  
Roan Ching-yueh , well-known writer and architect , has commented that Taiwan architects are often high above the crowd , separated from the average person by an unbridgeable gap , but the works of Chen Shih-liang " exhibit a desire to make a very friendly connection , " and foster a genuine , enjoyable conversation between those who study the aesthetics of architectural space up in their ivory towers and the people who actually use architectural space . The pictures in his books almost equal the text in volume and afford the reader a unique reading experience .  
Conservative estimates indicate that in urban schools , each classroom sees on average two or three emotionally disturbed students or students coming from problem families . " I 've even seen students who have sold sex on the Internet , and others who have been sexually abused in their own homes ! " says teacher Li Man-yun of Taipei 's Peicheng Junior High School . Indeed , such issues are beyond the professional capacities of teachers , and call for the assistance of social service agencies .

ODA is one such international opportunity , and for many countries , it is a crucial one .  But with generally weakening oil prices and regional wars , the average saving rate of these countries fell from almost 65 per cent of GDP in the mid-1970s to less than 25 per cent by the late 1980s ( see United Nations , World Economic Survey , 1992 ( United Nations publication , Sales No .
