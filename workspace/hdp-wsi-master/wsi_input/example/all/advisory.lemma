To set up the Court by a resolution of the General Assembly or of the Security Council as a principal or subsidiary organ thereof was considered efficient , time-saving and feasible pursuant to the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 1954 .  
A primary responsibility of the regional commissions is to provide advisory services and to strengthen regional networks by which Member States may exchange experience and information , and harmonize national economic , social , environmental and settlement policies and strategies - in particular those that have a critical cross-border impact on , inter alia , migration , shared coastal zones , river basins and ecosystems , watersheds , and pollution and waste management .

A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The international community must take specific measures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
The International Court of Justice has declared in a historic advisory opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of international law applicable to armed conflicts .  
And if nevertheless many countries did accede to it , including my own , this certainly reflects the conviction and the hope that they attach to the collective and multilateral task of disarmament , as reflected in the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 , which reminded us that all States have an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects , and under strict and effective international control .

At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner to create an environment viable for return in post _ conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad _ based programmes of human rights education as well as the strengthening of local non _ governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirming that the initiative on the pilot management scheme presented by the ECLAC secretariat is aimed at strengthening the role of the organization as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ,  
A number of delegations emphasized the need to strengthen the Commission 's role in operational activities , particularly technical assistance and advisory services , and to pay special attention to the needs of least developed and landlocked countries , island developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
The ongoing consolidation of the three Secretariat departments in the economic and social fields into one consolidated Department for Economic and Social Affairs will , inter alia , lead to integration of the Secretariat 's functions related to the provision of substantive support to intergovernmental processes and their normative setting activities , relevant analytical work and the provision of policy advisory services to Governments , at their request .  
The resources requested under this heading ( $ 26,485,400 ) reflect a resource growth of $ 6,324,100 , or 31.4 per cent , and comprise the costs of ( a ) advisory and custodial fees ( $ 26,300,000 ) , as detailed in paragraph 113 above , and ( b ) investment consultants ( $ 185,400 ) for special consulting and legal advice concerning the remaining custody agreements , as well as the agreement with the Master Record Keeper , which are scheduled to be reassessed and renegotiated in 1999 .  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .

Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to contribute to the creation of an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , and broad-based programmes of human rights education , and strengthening of local non-governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .  
An important teaching and educational tool is the established Professional Training Series , designed primarily to provide support to the training activities of the programme of advisory services and technical assistance of HCHR / CHR , as well as to assist other organizations involved in human rights education for professional groups .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
Also in its resolution 51 / 59 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to distribute to all States the International Code of Conduct for Public Officials , annexed to that resolution , and to include it in the manual on practical measures against corruption , to be revised and expanded by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 14 , with a view to promoting its use in advisory services , training and other technical assistance activities .  
The Commission expressed its appreciation to Member States contributing to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme by providing the services of associate experts , of consultants and of experts for training purposes , advisory missions and the implementation of technical assistance projects ; by developing training manuals and other material ; by offering fellowship opportunities ; and by hosting action-oriented workshops and expert group meetings . 
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
In order to foster the effective implementation of the Convention and to encourage international cooperation in the area of juvenile justice , the Committee transmits , as it may consider appropriate , to specialized agencies , UNICEF and other competent bodies any reports from States parties that contain a request , or indicate a need , for advisory services and technical assistance , along with observations and suggestions of the Committee , if any , on those requests or indications ( in accordance with article 45 ( b ) of the Convention ) .  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
One of 20 substantive themes identified for the advisory services programme is treaty reporting and international obligations ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 90 , para . 23 ) , but the independent expert has not been able to identify from the available documentation any case in which assistance has been provided specifically for either the undertaking of a survey of the necessary measures to be taken prior to ratification of a human rights treaty or the preparation of a report to a treaty body .  
Reaffirms that the provision of advisory services and technical cooperation may be seen as a complement to the monitoring activities of the human rights programme from which no Government is exempt , and notes in this regard that , in order to produce lasting results , monitoring and preventive activities may need to be accompanied by promotional activities through advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Reaffirms that advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights require close cooperation and coordination between United Nations bodies and specialized agencies active in this field so as to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their respective programmes and avoid unnecessary duplication , and requests the High Commissioner to explore yet further possibilities for cooperation with specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as non _ governmental organizations ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Requests the independent expert to report on the human rights situation in Somalia to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical assistance through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector ;
