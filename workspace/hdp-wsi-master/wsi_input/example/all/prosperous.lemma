Those responsible for primary party organizations must persistently follow the style of being truthful and realistic , waging a hard struggle , and working hard , establish themselves among the masses , be concerned about their weal and woe , put the interests of the party and the people above everything else , and , with enthusiasm and a strong sense of responsibility , lead the masses in striding toward an ever more prosperous future .

Both domestic and foreign hostile forces do not want to see the development of a strong , prosperous , and stable socialist China . They hope for chaos in China . They are constantly trying to " westernize " and " divide " China so as to achieve change amid chaos and to fish in troubled waters .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .

"  His election as president of the new century by the common people showed that the common people have great expectations for him , and hope he will lead Russia to a prosperous , stable , and strong tomorrow .

To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .

Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
The times we live in and the prevailing social and historic conditions determine that the Chinese people must take the socialist road if they are to make the country strong and prosperous and make everybody rich .  
The party 's third-generation leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core , as a faithful , reliable , enterprising and promising successor to the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping , has been leading the people of all nationalities cross the country in working hard together , keeping forging ahead and exerting themselves to make the country prosperous .  
Numerous facts have proven that US economic development is increasingly dependent on foreign countries and that the more peaceful and prosperous the world is and the more opened and developed the world is , the more it is beneficial to the United States . This all the more requires that the United States and various countries of the world improve their relations and support the peace and stability in the region .  
As a result of this struggle , the people of all nationalities throughout the country have further formed the common aspiration that China must develop , the nation must be rejuvenated , and society must be stable ; and they have further formed staunch fighting spirit for rousing ourselves to vigorous efforts to make the country prosperous , making China strong , and boosting our national strength .

This indicates that once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait , Taiwan will not be lucky enough to avoid being hurt .

Should this happen , Taiwan would stop being a beautiful and prosperous island .  
We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the central authorities , with the vigorous and selfless support of the people in the rest of the country , and with the unremitting efforts and hard work of people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet , the magnificent goal of building a united , prosperous , and civilized socialist new Tibet can definitely be achieved .
