"  
Speaking by regions , the economically more developed northern regions including Lombardy accounted for 45.1 percent of the national population , middle regions including the Lazio region , where the capital Rome is located , took up 19.2 percent , and southern regions including Sicily , where the economy is relatively underdeveloped , accounted for 35.7 percent .  
Experts believed that the situation was associated with the broad move of Italian domestic residents within the country in recent years , especially given that residents in southern regions , out of economic hardship , were increasingly moving to the economically more developed northern and middle regions to find jobs .  
As an important industrial city in northern China and a foreign trade port with vast inland , Tianjin 's light industry products , food products and livestock products exported to Russia last year accounted for 50% of the amount of export from Tianjin to Russia ; whereas steel and non-ferrous metals imported from Russia accounted for 60% of import volume from Russia .  
As a result , with the help of our troops in northern Manchuria , which attacked the enemy forces across the Linjiang three times , our troops in southern Manchuria successfully guarded Linjiang in four battles .  Subsequently , we successfully launched the spring and summer offensive and , as a result , our military situation in northeast China changed from strategic defense to strategic offense .  
Everywhere , from South China Sea outposts to northern borders , from east coasts to snowy plateau , headquarters offices , grass-roots companies and other units have done a great deal of arduous and meticulous ideological education work , focusing on " forever unchanged military spirit " .  Some generals personally give political lectures .  
On a military training base in the northern frontier where the winds were strong and grasses were robust , a combined real-troop and live-ammunition military exercise engaging in various arms of the services turned the vast grassland into a spectacular painting of a battlefield .  
The lake was more than 1,000 meters wide between its southern and northern banks .  Though it was by no means difficult for someone carrying nothing to cross the lake , it was indeed far from easy for the " special combat " soldiers , who were each carrying equipment as heavy as or more than 20 kilograms , to do the same .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
The new leading body of the Beijing Military Representatives Bureau conducted in-depth investigation and held a " forum on weaponry development " in late August with the participation of leaders and relevant experts from the offices of science , technology and industry for national defense , in five provinces and cities in northern China , all military enterprises , and military representatives offices stationed in various enterprises and jointly discussed plans with them on scientific research and development of military products .  
Since 1996 when the five-year northern border defense construction program was officially kicked off , leading organs concerned at all levels have laid emphasis on improving the border defense infrastructure , enhancing the use of high technologies in carrying out defense duties , strengthening the construction of basic command and communications networks , and boosting the rapid reaction capability to deal with emergency situations along the border .  For this , they have acquired funds from various sources and made an overall plan to work in a scientific way .  
These four bright spots in the dramatically changed DPRK-ROK relations manifested the common wishes of ending confrontation , and seeking peace and prosperity for the people on the southern and northern parts of the Korean peninsula , and were universally supported and welcomed by the people of the north and south and by the international community .  
However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
From China 's northern borders where spring is much in the air to southern China where trees are turning green and from the coastal areas where the ground is full of fallen flowers to the headstreams of the Chang Jiang and Huang He where snow and ice begin to thaw , the public securities organizations have taken rapid actions to form a huge and comprehensive anti-crime network .  
In particular , after a three-year , large-scale production campaign , the barren mountains and wild hills were turned into the " fertile lower Chang Jiang valley of northern Shaanxi , " an achievement that won commendations and awards from Chairman Mao and the party Central Committee and helped establish a glorious banner for the entire army .  
In August of that same year , after Japan surrendered , the army , upon receiving orders from the central leadership , continued south , arriving in northern Guangdong where it prepared for a rendezvous with the Dongjiang Column . However , with its advance blocked by the Kuomingtang troops , it went north to rendezvous again with the 5th Division of the New 4th Army .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
From northern frontiers bathing in a luxuriant spring to the south land dressing in green , from the coastal areas full of fallen flowers to the high plateaus of melting snow , the armed police units are all carrying out raids with triumphant results .  
They have set up many drug-trafficking strongholds and built warehouses to store narcotics inside and outside of China . They have modified and camouflaged their motor vehicles , and adopted clever methods of operating , such as crypto-communications , mutual surveillance 's , sector-by-sector shipments , and one-way phone connections .  They have successfully detoured around checkpoints , and shipped drugs from northern Burma to inland China , and other places overseas , through Yunnan .  
Wang Tao , a leading scientist engaging in the study of the desertization process in northern China and the way to prevent and control the process who earned a doctoral degree in a foreign country , said : In his " 1 July " speech , Jiang Zemin pointed out the need to fully realize the great importance of fighting corruption and building a clean government , and to carry out to the end the work to build up the party style and promote clean government administration , as well as the struggle against corruption .  
A rapid response unit will join in the military exercise for the first time .  The special armed unit whose members were transferred from the Beijing Theater 's certain group army , has accomplished various assault training missions in northern China over the last two years .  The unit has been airlifted to the Fuzhou Theater by Russia-made IL-76 transport planes to join in live-fire training .  In addition , the airborne force is now in a predetermined area awaiting orders .  The marine corps has also sent a task force to take part in the war drill .  
In line with the overall plan of building three trans-regional integrated power grids in the northern , central and southern parts of China , during the " 10th Five-Year " plan period and based on the trans-regional power supply and integrated power grid project construction plan , we will build 2,500 kilometers of alternating current lines and 4,345 kilometers of direct current lines of 500 kilovolts .  
Investment projects in these areas will include building roads and water and power supply systems in the rural areas , building permanent and semi-permanent housings for herdsmen in a way according to the local situations , intensifying comprehensive agricultural development , and developing the Brahmaputra [ the Yaluzangbu Jiang ] and two other rivers , as well as developing animal husbandry in northern Tibet .  
As an important measure for structural readjustment , the Chinese government has canceled the protective prices of poor-quality-seed grain , such as southern early rice and northern spring wheat , encouraged the production of marketable , good-quality-seed produce , and increased the purchase-price difference according to quality .

Being a close neighbor of the peninsula , China has always supported enhancing mutual trust and improving relations between the northern and southern sides of the peninsula through dialogue and contacts without foreign interference , and eventually bringing about independent and peaceful reunification through dialogue and negotiations . 
In the letter Jiang Zemin reaffirmed that the north side and the south side are major parties concerned in the peninsula affairs , that China actively supports the consistent position of the northern side 's and southern side 's realizing independence and peaceful unification through dialogue and consultations , that China will , as always , continue to make positive efforts to help maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula .  
Such circumstances have already emerged in some localities .  Take the northern region which has relied upon drilling water to irrigate cultivated land for a long time as an example : Owing to the excessive pumping of underground water , the underground water level in this region has fallen rapidly , causing strata to subside in varying degrees .  In north China and other regions , the excessive extraction of underground water has led to underground funnels and surface subsidence and has entailed rather serious consequences .  
A few days ago , at a certain sea port in northern Jiangsu , more than 30 civilian ships of large tonnage called up by the Jiangsu Provincial Military District carried officers and men of a certain motorized infantry brigade and heavy equipment and sailed towards the wavy Huang Hai sea area to start a two-day , two-night sea-crossing and military tactics and technology training .  
He bought off many Customs officials and local leaders in many northern China cities , smuggled large amounts of oil , many cars , and steel products into China worth nearly 10 billion yuan .  He formed a north-south smuggling chain with smuggling king Lai Changxing that led people to say at one time : " We have Lai Changxing in the south , and you have Yao Zhisheng in the north . "  
Following a hostile confrontation that has lasted for over half a century , the northern and southern side of the Korean Peninsula have come to realize that at a time when peace and development is the major theme in the world today , confrontation has no way out ; only by seeking dialogue and cooperation , and aspiring for peace and unification will they be able to advance toward a bright and beautiful future .  
A commander from the army missile headquarters gave a brief report to President Chen Shui-bian , noting that the Patriot missiles deployed in northern Taiwan by the Army Patriot Missile Battery have tactically been test fired by the " tactical testing group under the US Army Pacific . " Also , through operations of testing systems , simulated and live air-combat maneuvers , mobile maneuvers , and combat drills , these missiles have all been proved successful in meeting the specification standards of the US army and acquired the high assessments by the United States .  
At the same time , Iraq is losing no opportunity in launching a strong diplomatic offensive in appealing to the United Nations and countries around the world to condemn the US-British outrage , so as to gain the sympathy of the international community and attain the goal of easing the 10-year sanctions on Iraq as soon as possible and abolishing the " no-fly zones " set up in northern and southern Iraq by the Americans and British .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
Besides , the total quantity of water to be diverted from southern China to northern region during first phase and second phase will be only 50 billion cubic meters , accounting for just one-fourth of the need .  Therefore , judging from the current situation or a long-range plan , we still must place the economical use of water in first place .  
New arrangements for the warning of heavy rain , including a revised rainstorm warning system , the termination of the flood warning , and the introduction of special announcements on flooding in the northern New Territories , will be implemented for the coming rain season , the Director of the Hong Kong Observatory , Dr H K Lam , announced today ( Thursday ) .  
The Area is developed primarily for residential , passive recreation and conservation uses .  Low to medium density residential uses , and Government , institution and community ( GIC ) uses are concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the area .  The remaining part occupying about 65 per cent of the total area is reserved for open space and green belt uses .  
The general planning intention of the area is to conserve the intrinsic natural character of the scenic hilly landscape on the western and northern parts , to promote recreation and productive agriculture on the valley floors , to upgrade the obsolete and sub-standard housing in the central and southern parts , and to maintain the character and intensity of the residential developments in the area .  
In the Yung Long archaeological site , relics such as firing hearths , postholes , workshops for manufacturing stone tools and burials , as well as fine stone slotted rings and stone Yue ( ceremonial axe regarded as symbol of power ) imply the development of a more complex social structure and suggest that prehistoric Pearl River Delta had cultural exchanges with not just the northern and eastern part of Guangdong , but as far away as the eastern coast of China as well .  
Members of the audience were fascinated by the stylish performance that featured bold and energetic art style of the northern land .  Heilongjiang Province Song and Dance Theatre is a well-established provincial-level performing group .  Since its establishment in 1954 , the Theatre has produced and performed folk music and dance programmes with rich regional flavour , and has won the national Wenhua Award .  
Facing the double threat , Chiang Kai-shek formulated a farsighted policy of " maintaining internal security first and then expelling foreign invasion . " In 1934 the Communists were finally driven out of Kiangsi province . They fled to the bleak northern section of Shensi , with only 2,000 to 3,000 followers remaining . People of seven provinces were thus freed from Communist harassment .  
The village , established six years ago in Taoyuan in northern Taiwan , has 16 houses each equipped with modern amenities and run by a trained and well-educated nurse who acts as a surrogate mother for the orphans living in her charge . The children not only regard her as " mother " but also look upon each other as brothers and sisters .  
The freeway extends from Keelung , the northern port of Taiwan , traversing through the lush and densely populated narrow western plain of the island to the southern port of Kaohsiung .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
It is the most southerly point on Taiwan , and is the site of a towering white lighthouse known as the " Light of East Asia " , standing 18 meters tall . Some say that on a clear day , the northern islands of the neighbouring Philippine archipelago can be seen across the waters of the Bashi channel . From one perspective , Maobitou and Oluanbi can be seen as the claws of a huge crab cradling a long , broken strip of fine sand beaches .  
The complex physical topography of the island also proved beneficial - - as the climate warmed in the post-glacial period the high mountain slopes provided an ideal environment for the more temperate climate species . Therefore , there are still many species of birds found only in more northern regions existing in the high elevation areas of Taiwan .  
Looking at this list it is obvious that the foreign tourists ' knowledge of scenic spots relies on outdated information , and that recently developed scenic areas , such as the northern and eastern coasts and Orchid Island have not been sufficiently promoted abroad . This , in the end , is a great loss for the tourists themselves . "  
One of the " four kings , " Ting Tung-san , recalls Hsing 's typical northern character : simple in his habits , able to get by for long periods on dried foods ; careful and steady ; a stable , disciplined climber .  
To date , except for the fourth nuclear power plant , on which work has temporarily been stopped , for the Tai-chung coal-fired power plant , the number two northern highway , and the Taipei metropolitan rapid transit system , for which preparatory work is being undertaken , and for the Ssuchunghsi reservoir and the Mingtan electric power peaking facility , the plans for which are now being examined , the other 24 projects are all under way and from 20 to 70 percent completed , so that in general things can be considered to be running smoothly .  
The scene was northern China , the language spontaneous and sometimes colloquial , and the mood ranging from nostalgia to humor . This was followed by impressionistic pieces on foreign lands , such as Paris and London , which coincided with the period of exoticism in the late fifties but are unmistakably individual because of their dramatic rather than merely lyrical treatment .  
Wang says that all Chinese lions - - be they small-scale figures for utilitarian decoration or imposing statues designed to guard against evil - - can generally be classified into one of two styles , a northern and a southern . The northern lion is majestic and awesome , while the southern lion is warmer and gentler and often reveals a smile .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
Explaining the reasons underlying soil acidification , Chang Hsueh-k'un , director of the Taoyuan Agricultural Improvement Farm , points out that in addition to factors such as the relatively high acidity of northern Taiwan 's red soil , the loss of alkaline cations from the soil through heavy rainfall and the heavy use of chemical fertilizers by Taiwan farmers , " sulphurous discharges released by Taiwan 's petrochemical plants are another reason why the soil is turning acidic . "  
Out at the rustic chicken restaurant you take a hot spring bath first to work up a good appetite , then a meal of coq-au-vin in the fresh mountain air leaves you feeling wonderfully relaxed , " says free-range chicken aficionado Mr . Ch'en . Mt . Shamao has long been famous in northern Taiwan for its hot springs , frequently visited by elderly keep-fit fans .  
What disturbed the Mexican people was the presence of another group who had entered the Northern Territory as common laborers on the newly opening land but who through their mutual aid and commercial savvy were able to shed their status as slaves and emerge as a class of " small capitalists " in little more than ten years . Starting with restaurants , laundry shops , and grocery stores and moving on to shoe factories , and garment factories , the Chinese carved out a definite niche for themselves in the economy of northern Mexico .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
The secluded pond is as flat as a mirror , and only rarely does a gust of cool wind passing through the woods wrinkle the white clouds and blue sky of the northern Taiwan summer day reflected on its surface .  
Usually found in the temperate zone , most of them were brought from abroad by migratory birds like the quillwort and the Sparganium fallax . Their taking root in the subtropical environment of Taiwan has greatly startled international botanists . Among them are plants found at their southern most geographical limit : The Nuphar shimadai is especially noteworthy because it belongs to temperate zone family of water plants found mostly in North America and the northern parts of the Eurasian land mass .  
Instead , they use a blue cloth banner with the lines " Respectfully sending off the southern god of fire ; welcoming in the northern god of water , " which is exchanged for festive red couplets after the ceremony .  
Critics hold that Red Sorghum , which carries the mysterious colors of silence on the vast northern plain on which it is set and describes a strong northern man taking a wife , and Judou , which describes the melancholy of a beautiful women suppressing her sexuality , are both " packaged in exoticness . "  
Fortyeight-year-old Li Feng-chin is already a grandma and takes care of a sizable vegetable garden ; as for Cheng Mei-hsia , born in 1970 , after having a child she resigned her full time accounting job and entered the relatively free puma company ; Liao Chiu-hsiang , born in 1969 , hated the dull routine of factory work and after working in northern Taiwan for more than a year decided to return to Hsiluo to dance with the cloth horse .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
In the winter the northeast seasonal winds blow strong and harsh , pushing sand and rocks into the northern outlet to the sea . The water thus flows out through the southern exit point . In the summer come the southeast seasonal winds , which blow silt into the southern outlet , so that the Hsiukuluan River heads north for the summer .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
The inhabitants of northern Thailand adopted the scorched earth method of planting . The poppy cultivation drained off a great deal of the earth 's fertility , and they were unable to grow successive crops on the same patch of soil . Fields had to be rotated . In addition , minority people used to cut down a good many trees in order to build houses , so that what was originally a stretch of virgin forest in northern Thailand had become a bald mountain with burnt out patches in between .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
Shadowless feetHuang Fei-hong was a master of the southern Chinese kungfu , which stresses planting oneself firmly . ( They call the idea " bronze bridge , iron horse . " ) In attacking they strived for steadiness , and so they did n't kick any higher than their waists . The flips and high leaps featured in the movies are derived mainly from the highly vigorous and agile movements of northern kungfu .  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
During the northeast rains when the northeast coast has very choppy seas , the southwest coast still has calm waters , when its garden undersea is as beautiful as ever . And when the summer winds bring the southwest rains , divers can go to the northern reefs .  
Looked at from the ocean , he says , the volcanic mountains of the Tatun group appear to be perfectly rounded and smooth , presenting a markedly different picture from the craggy peaks of southern Taiwan . For Portuguese mariners who had already been through the Straits of Malacca and past Luzon Island it is Taiwan 's northern scenery that must have seemed especially remarkable and fresh .  
No matter whether you are talking about the Tatun Mountains or the tail end of the Huoshan and Hsuehshan Mountains toward Keelung , anyone looking from a ship at sea would not have seen some narrow , specific little point . Perhaps we will never be able to figure out which place it was that inspired " Formosa , " but the most reasonable explanation still seems to be that ships were passing Taiwan 's northern edge . This theory also says something about the unique aesthetic of this region 's coastline . "  
The elephant veteranWhen they arrived at the military base at the head of Fengshan Bay , Ah-Lan passed away , perhaps because she could not adjust to the new environs . And because the military was not actively engaged , the remaining two elephants could only look forward to retirement . Later on , they were sent straight up to the Taipei Zoo , then located in the northern suburb of Yuanshan .  
But the fact that the Chungho cases were all concentrated in a specific area ( around the small mountain behind Le Tien Temple and a few areas of similar topography ) means that the vectors have set down very firm roots in this city in northern Taiwan , creating what is defined as a " local epidemic . "  
Super slim , super fastThis year Lu Chen-fang , a lecturer at the Chang Geng College of Nursing , did a survey of more than 700 second-year nursing students at nine nursing colleges in northern Taiwan . The survey discovered that fully 87% of those of normal weight ( meaning within 10% of the standard weight for their height ) and of those who were slightly thin ( 10-20% below their standard weight ) thought themselves to be " too fat . "  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Anyone holding an outdoor activity in rainy northern Taiwan has to depend on fate to make any money . So the main reason for choosing Taoyuan for the inauguration was the venue 's special feature : The transparent " sky tent " that can keep out the elements while allowing natural sunlight in , thus insuring that the event would not be rained out or blown off course .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
Driving south along the freeway , you leave behind moist northern Taiwan and reach the Huoyan Mountains of Miaoli County . This dry , barren land presents a scene of nothing but landslip-scarred brown earth . But the cold windward upper slopes of the mountains are the lonely stronghold of the " minority people " among Taiwan 's pines-the masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) .  
Kuo , who has designed many of the trails in the Taipei vicinity , emphasizes that Taiwan is very special . It is at the juncture of tropical and sub-tropical climatic regions , with high temperatures and heavy rains year round . Moreover , given its mountainous terrain , all the forest forms of the northern hemisphere are here , layered one on top of the other .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
Mingling among the other ducks , northern shovelers ( Anas clypeata ) busily sift fresh primitive algae out of the mud with their broad , shovel-shaped bills ; pintails ( Anas acuta ) , with their somewhat surprising needle-like tail feathers , stand alone to one side , heads turned back , preening themelves ; green-winged teal ( Anas crecca ) , shake their wet tails as they waddle up out of the water , calling as they brush past their companions who , with heads uplifted , are on their way in .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Although many travelers were already familiar with the Yangming Mountains , their volcanic terrain was something missing from other national parks . In their northern part there were many pristine peaks , including Mt . Tatun and the Kuangtsui Range . Beyond these were the north coast and Chinshan . Together they comprised an extensive nature area for northern Taiwan , and they became Taiwan 's third national park .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
On a platform marked " northern lions " stands a stocky , powerful lion with well-defined bones and muscles and the heavy brows and large eyes of a true-grit son of North China . His angry gaze is reminiscent of the many stone lions which crouch along both sides of Marco Polo Bridge , where they witnessed the blood and tears of China 's eight-year war with Japan .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Since then , Tainan-style pork noodles , spicy Hunan chicken and Peking roast duck have formed a chorus line on Taiwan 's restaurant buffets . Disciples of Tibetan lamas have worshipped next door to followers of the mother goddess Matzu , and gents from northeast China have made brides of Penghu ladies . For half a century , southern accents have mixed with northern ones . The Three Gorges of the Yangtze and the Chuoshui River have both nourished the imaginations of Taiwanese people .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .

Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
Because the royal Li family of the Tang dynasty were descended from western and northern minorities , the Tang dynasty was deeply influenced by their culture , and the hunks of the Tang dynasty were all tall and broad-shouldered with strong physiques .

The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush .

But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .

There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
The lava pushed up by volcanic activity around the main island of Taiwan was mainly composed of andesite . Molten andesite has a relatively higher content of silicon dioxide , so is more sticky .

The lake was more than 1,000 meters wide between its southern and northern banks .  Though it was by no means difficult for someone carrying nothing to cross the lake , it was indeed far from easy for the " special combat " soldiers , who were each carrying equipment as heavy as or more than 20 kilograms , to do the same .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .

However , there is one point which the MAC has neglected .  Not all the key industrial cities today are located in northern China , but are located in the southeastern coast of the mainland such as Jiangsu , Guangdong and Fujian . In terms of geographic distance , they can be formed into an industrial group with Taiwan . However , the political factors have made most people feel today that the distance between both sides of the strait is too far to be reached .  
From China 's northern borders where spring is much in the air to southern China where trees are turning green and from the coastal areas where the ground is full of fallen flowers to the headstreams of the Chang Jiang and Huang He where snow and ice begin to thaw , the public securities organizations have taken rapid actions to form a huge and comprehensive anti-crime network .  
In particular , after a three-year , large-scale production campaign , the barren mountains and wild hills were turned into the " fertile lower Chang Jiang valley of northern Shaanxi , " an achievement that won commendations and awards from Chairman Mao and the party Central Committee and helped establish a glorious banner for the entire army .  
In August of that same year , after Japan surrendered , the army , upon receiving orders from the central leadership , continued south , arriving in northern Guangdong where it prepared for a rendezvous with the Dongjiang Column .

Such circumstances have already emerged in some localities .  Take the northern region which has relied upon drilling water to irrigate cultivated land for a long time as an example : Owing to the excessive pumping of underground water , the underground water level in this region has fallen rapidly , causing strata to subside in varying degrees .  In north China and other regions , the excessive extraction of underground water has led to underground funnels and surface subsidence and has entailed rather serious consequences .  
A few days ago , at a certain sea port in northern Jiangsu , more than 30 civilian ships of large tonnage called up by the Jiangsu Provincial Military District carried officers and men of a certain motorized infantry brigade and heavy equipment and sailed towards the wavy Huang Hai sea area to start a two-day , two-night sea-crossing and military tactics and technology training .  
He bought off many Customs officials and local leaders in many northern China cities , smuggled large amounts of oil , many cars , and steel products into China worth nearly 10 billion yuan .  He formed a north-south smuggling chain with smuggling king Lai Changxing that led people to say at one time : " We have Lai Changxing in the south , and you have Yao Zhisheng in the north . "  
Following a hostile confrontation that has lasted for over half a century , the northern and southern side of the Korean Peninsula have come to realize that at a time when peace and development is the major theme in the world today , confrontation has no way out ; only by seeking dialogue and cooperation , and aspiring for peace and unification will they be able to advance toward a bright and beautiful future .  
A commander from the army missile headquarters gave a brief report to President Chen Shui-bian , noting that the Patriot missiles deployed in northern Taiwan by the Army Patriot Missile Battery have tactically been test fired by the " tactical testing group under the US Army Pacific . " Also , through operations of testing systems , simulated and live air-combat maneuvers , mobile maneuvers , and combat drills , these missiles have all been proved successful in meeting the specification standards of the US army and acquired the high assessments by the United States .  
At the same time , Iraq is losing no opportunity in launching a strong diplomatic offensive in appealing to the United Nations and countries around the world to condemn the US-British outrage , so as to gain the sympathy of the international community and attain the goal of easing the 10-year sanctions on Iraq as soon as possible and abolishing the " no-fly zones " set up in northern and southern Iraq by the Americans and British .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
Besides , the total quantity of water to be diverted from southern China to northern region during first phase and second phase will be only 50 billion cubic meters , accounting for just one-fourth of the need .  Therefore , judging from the current situation or a long-range plan , we still must place the economical use of water in first place .  
New arrangements for the warning of heavy rain , including a revised rainstorm warning system , the termination of the flood warning , and the introduction of special announcements on flooding in the northern New Territories , will be implemented for the coming rain season , the Director of the Hong Kong Observatory , Dr H K Lam , announced today ( Thursday ) .  
The Area is developed primarily for residential , passive recreation and conservation uses .  Low to medium density residential uses , and Government , institution and community ( GIC ) uses are concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of the area .  The remaining part occupying about 65 per cent of the total area is reserved for open space and green belt uses .  
The general planning intention of the area is to conserve the intrinsic natural character of the scenic hilly landscape on the western and northern parts , to promote recreation and productive agriculture on the valley floors , to upgrade the obsolete and sub-standard housing in the central and southern parts , and to maintain the character and intensity of the residential developments in the area .  
In the Yung Long archaeological site , relics such as firing hearths , postholes , workshops for manufacturing stone tools and burials , as well as fine stone slotted rings and stone Yue ( ceremonial axe regarded as symbol of power ) imply the development of a more complex social structure and suggest that prehistoric Pearl River Delta had cultural exchanges with not just the northern and eastern part of Guangdong , but as far away as the eastern coast of China as well .  
Members of the audience were fascinated by the stylish performance that featured bold and energetic art style of the northern land .  Heilongjiang Province Song and Dance Theatre is a well-established provincial-level performing group .  Since its establishment in 1954 , the Theatre has produced and performed folk music and dance programmes with rich regional flavour , and has won the national Wenhua Award .  
Facing the double threat , Chiang Kai-shek formulated a farsighted policy of " maintaining internal security first and then expelling foreign invasion . " In 1934 the Communists were finally driven out of Kiangsi province . They fled to the bleak northern section of Shensi , with only 2,000 to 3,000 followers remaining . People of seven provinces were thus freed from Communist harassment .  
The village , established six years ago in Taoyuan in northern Taiwan , has 16 houses each equipped with modern amenities and run by a trained and well-educated nurse who acts as a surrogate mother for the orphans living in her charge . The children not only regard her as " mother " but also look upon each other as brothers and sisters .  
The freeway extends from Keelung , the northern port of Taiwan , traversing through the lush and densely populated narrow western plain of the island to the southern port of Kaohsiung .  
With the completion of the North Link Railroad between Suao and Hualien , a major port city at the northern end of the narrow coastal plain due to be completed by the end of this year , further development in eastern Taiwan is possible .  
In the past , surface communications between northern and eastern Taiwan were more or less limited to the Suao-Hualien Highway , a one-way road traversing rugged mountains which is both dangerous and easily disrupted by landslides during typhoons or other periods of heavy rain .  
The Central Taiwan Vocational Training Center , the southern and northern Taiwan vocational training centers operated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the Taishan vocational training center operated by the Ministry of the Interior , the first youth vocational training center run by the National Youth Commission , the northern provincial vocational training center , Taipei municipal vocational training center , eastern Taiwan vocational training center , and a vocational training center for retired servicemen .  
It is the most southerly point on Taiwan , and is the site of a towering white lighthouse known as the " Light of East Asia " , standing 18 meters tall . Some say that on a clear day , the northern islands of the neighbouring Philippine archipelago can be seen across the waters of the Bashi channel . From one perspective , Maobitou and Oluanbi can be seen as the claws of a huge crab cradling a long , broken strip of fine sand beaches .  
The complex physical topography of the island also proved beneficial - - as the climate warmed in the post-glacial period the high mountain slopes provided an ideal environment for the more temperate climate species . Therefore , there are still many species of birds found only in more northern regions existing in the high elevation areas of Taiwan .  
Looking at this list it is obvious that the foreign tourists ' knowledge of scenic spots relies on outdated information , and that recently developed scenic areas , such as the northern and eastern coasts and Orchid Island have not been sufficiently promoted abroad . This , in the end , is a great loss for the tourists themselves . "  
One of the " four kings , " Ting Tung-san , recalls Hsing 's typical northern character : simple in his habits , able to get by for long periods on dried foods ; careful and steady ; a stable , disciplined climber .  
To date , except for the fourth nuclear power plant , on which work has temporarily been stopped , for the Tai-chung coal-fired power plant , the number two northern highway , and the Taipei metropolitan rapid transit system , for which preparatory work is being undertaken , and for the Ssuchunghsi reservoir and the Mingtan electric power peaking facility , the plans for which are now being examined , the other 24 projects are all under way and from 20 to 70 percent completed , so that in general things can be considered to be running smoothly .  
The scene was northern China , the language spontaneous and sometimes colloquial , and the mood ranging from nostalgia to humor . This was followed by impressionistic pieces on foreign lands , such as Paris and London , which coincided with the period of exoticism in the late fifties but are unmistakably individual because of their dramatic rather than merely lyrical treatment .  
Wang says that all Chinese lions - - be they small-scale figures for utilitarian decoration or imposing statues designed to guard against evil - - can generally be classified into one of two styles , a northern and a southern . The northern lion is majestic and awesome , while the southern lion is warmer and gentler and often reveals a smile .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
In 1975 the director of National Central University 's Environmental Center , Lu Shih-tsung , initiated an islandwide survey of Taiwan 's rainfall . His project was taken up by the Taiwan Forestry Research Institute and other university research bodies , together with the EPA . Their report indicated that the rainfall in many parts of Taiwan , such as the central mountainous region , is still " clean , " but the rain in the major conurbations of northern and southern Taiwan , together with certain industrial zones , is becoming more and more acidic .  
Explaining the reasons underlying soil acidification , Chang Hsueh-k'un , director of the Taoyuan Agricultural Improvement Farm , points out that in addition to factors such as the relatively high acidity of northern Taiwan 's red soil , the loss of alkaline cations from the soil through heavy rainfall and the heavy use of chemical fertilizers by Taiwan farmers , " sulphurous discharges released by Taiwan 's petrochemical plants are another reason why the soil is turning acidic . "  
Out at the rustic chicken restaurant you take a hot spring bath first to work up a good appetite , then a meal of coq-au-vin in the fresh mountain air leaves you feeling wonderfully relaxed , " says free-range chicken aficionado Mr . Ch'en . Mt . Shamao has long been famous in northern Taiwan for its hot springs , frequently visited by elderly keep-fit fans .  
What disturbed the Mexican people was the presence of another group who had entered the Northern Territory as common laborers on the newly opening land but who through their mutual aid and commercial savvy were able to shed their status as slaves and emerge as a class of " small capitalists " in little more than ten years . Starting with restaurants , laundry shops , and grocery stores and moving on to shoe factories , and garment factories , the Chinese carved out a definite niche for themselves in the economy of northern Mexico .  
In the past few years , because of other major infrastructure projects like the mass transit system , the second northern express , and the inland line , because many corporations had bought up the factory land early on for low prices , overnight the value of their assets became many times the capital investment .  
The secluded pond is as flat as a mirror , and only rarely does a gust of cool wind passing through the woods wrinkle the white clouds and blue sky of the northern Taiwan summer day reflected on its surface .  
Usually found in the temperate zone , most of them were brought from abroad by migratory birds like the quillwort and the Sparganium fallax . Their taking root in the subtropical environment of Taiwan has greatly startled international botanists . Among them are plants found at their southern most geographical limit : The Nuphar shimadai is especially noteworthy because it belongs to temperate zone family of water plants found mostly in North America and the northern parts of the Eurasian land mass .  
Instead , they use a blue cloth banner with the lines " Respectfully sending off the southern god of fire ; welcoming in the northern god of water , " which is exchanged for festive red couplets after the ceremony .  
Critics hold that Red Sorghum , which carries the mysterious colors of silence on the vast northern plain on which it is set and describes a strong northern man taking a wife , and Judou , which describes the melancholy of a beautiful women suppressing her sexuality , are both " packaged in exoticness . "  
Fortyeight-year-old Li Feng-chin is already a grandma and takes care of a sizable vegetable garden ; as for Cheng Mei-hsia , born in 1970 , after having a child she resigned her full time accounting job and entered the relatively free puma company ; Liao Chiu-hsiang , born in 1969 , hated the dull routine of factory work and after working in northern Taiwan for more than a year decided to return to Hsiluo to dance with the cloth horse .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
In the winter the northeast seasonal winds blow strong and harsh , pushing sand and rocks into the northern outlet to the sea . The water thus flows out through the southern exit point . In the summer come the southeast seasonal winds , which blow silt into the southern outlet , so that the Hsiukuluan River heads north for the summer .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
The inhabitants of northern Thailand adopted the scorched earth method of planting . The poppy cultivation drained off a great deal of the earth 's fertility , and they were unable to grow successive crops on the same patch of soil . Fields had to be rotated . In addition , minority people used to cut down a good many trees in order to build houses , so that what was originally a stretch of virgin forest in northern Thailand had become a bald mountain with burnt out patches in between .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
Shadowless feetHuang Fei-hong was a master of the southern Chinese kungfu , which stresses planting oneself firmly . ( They call the idea " bronze bridge , iron horse . " ) In attacking they strived for steadiness , and so they did n't kick any higher than their waists . The flips and high leaps featured in the movies are derived mainly from the highly vigorous and agile movements of northern kungfu .  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
During the northeast rains when the northeast coast has very choppy seas , the southwest coast still has calm waters , when its garden undersea is as beautiful as ever . And when the summer winds bring the southwest rains , divers can go to the northern reefs .  
Looked at from the ocean , he says , the volcanic mountains of the Tatun group appear to be perfectly rounded and smooth , presenting a markedly different picture from the craggy peaks of southern Taiwan . For Portuguese mariners who had already been through the Straits of Malacca and past Luzon Island it is Taiwan 's northern scenery that must have seemed especially remarkable and fresh .  
No matter whether you are talking about the Tatun Mountains or the tail end of the Huoshan and Hsuehshan Mountains toward Keelung , anyone looking from a ship at sea would not have seen some narrow , specific little point . Perhaps we will never be able to figure out which place it was that inspired " Formosa , " but the most reasonable explanation still seems to be that ships were passing Taiwan 's northern edge . This theory also says something about the unique aesthetic of this region 's coastline . "  
The elephant veteranWhen they arrived at the military base at the head of Fengshan Bay , Ah-Lan passed away , perhaps because she could not adjust to the new environs . And because the military was not actively engaged , the remaining two elephants could only look forward to retirement . Later on , they were sent straight up to the Taipei Zoo , then located in the northern suburb of Yuanshan .  
But the fact that the Chungho cases were all concentrated in a specific area ( around the small mountain behind Le Tien Temple and a few areas of similar topography ) means that the vectors have set down very firm roots in this city in northern Taiwan , creating what is defined as a " local epidemic . "  
Super slim , super fastThis year Lu Chen-fang , a lecturer at the Chang Geng College of Nursing , did a survey of more than 700 second-year nursing students at nine nursing colleges in northern Taiwan . The survey discovered that fully 87% of those of normal weight ( meaning within 10% of the standard weight for their height ) and of those who were slightly thin ( 10-20% below their standard weight ) thought themselves to be " too fat . "  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Anyone holding an outdoor activity in rainy northern Taiwan has to depend on fate to make any money . So the main reason for choosing Taoyuan for the inauguration was the venue 's special feature : The transparent " sky tent " that can keep out the elements while allowing natural sunlight in , thus insuring that the event would not be rained out or blown off course .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
In those days , because of geographical factors , northern and southern Taiwan developed distinct varieties of settlement . On the wide , flat plains of southern Taiwan , villages basically massed together . In the mountainous north , settlement was spread out among many little villages .  
Driving south along the freeway , you leave behind moist northern Taiwan and reach the Huoyan Mountains of Miaoli County . This dry , barren land presents a scene of nothing but landslip-scarred brown earth . But the cold windward upper slopes of the mountains are the lonely stronghold of the " minority people " among Taiwan 's pines-the masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) .  
Kuo , who has designed many of the trails in the Taipei vicinity , emphasizes that Taiwan is very special . It is at the juncture of tropical and sub-tropical climatic regions , with high temperatures and heavy rains year round . Moreover , given its mountainous terrain , all the forest forms of the northern hemisphere are here , layered one on top of the other .  
In the first half of October , ROC Vice President Lien Chan paid a visit to Europe . After his itinerary was revealed , it inevitably met with intense pressure from Beijing . The result was that this journey , originally to have covered northern , central and southern Europe and intended to build friendly foreign relations with the three countries of Iceland , Austria and Spain , lost Spain as a destination .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
Mingling among the other ducks , northern shovelers ( Anas clypeata ) busily sift fresh primitive algae out of the mud with their broad , shovel-shaped bills ; pintails ( Anas acuta ) , with their somewhat surprising needle-like tail feathers , stand alone to one side , heads turned back , preening themelves ; green-winged teal ( Anas crecca ) , shake their wet tails as they waddle up out of the water , calling as they brush past their companions who , with heads uplifted , are on their way in .  
During the Sino-Japanese war of 1895 , the northern fleet was completely destroyed . By the time of the collective foreign invasion during the Boxer Rebellion , there was complete psychological collapse among the Chinese masses , and the Qing government finally realized the seriousness of the problem of having a population living in ignorance .  
Although many travelers were already familiar with the Yangming Mountains , their volcanic terrain was something missing from other national parks . In their northern part there were many pristine peaks , including Mt . Tatun and the Kuangtsui Range . Beyond these were the north coast and Chinshan . Together they comprised an extensive nature area for northern Taiwan , and they became Taiwan 's third national park .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
On a platform marked " northern lions " stands a stocky , powerful lion with well-defined bones and muscles and the heavy brows and large eyes of a true-grit son of North China . His angry gaze is reminiscent of the many stone lions which crouch along both sides of Marco Polo Bridge , where they witnessed the blood and tears of China 's eight-year war with Japan .  
Unlike the heavy northern lions , the " southern lions " which dominate another corner sport relaxed grins . The typical southern lion has a twisting head and wagging tail , flowing lines , and a happy smile which seems to say that over the thousands of years of Chinese history it has seen much joy and many rich harvests .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
According to Hsinchu mayor Tsai Jen-chien , " There is little free space within the city limits , so we can only carry out rationalization and renewal on present scale . But the city enjoys many other assets due to its long history and culture . " From the Qing dynasty through to the Japanese colonial period , Hsinchu was one of northern Taiwan 's key political and economic centers , and this has left the city with a rich legacy of cultural assets .  
Since then , Tainan-style pork noodles , spicy Hunan chicken and Peking roast duck have formed a chorus line on Taiwan 's restaurant buffets . Disciples of Tibetan lamas have worshipped next door to followers of the mother goddess Matzu , and gents from northeast China have made brides of Penghu ladies . For half a century , southern accents have mixed with northern ones . The Three Gorges of the Yangtze and the Chuoshui River have both nourished the imaginations of Taiwanese people .  
Nanguan is most popular in Quanzhou , Xiamen , and the Minnan-speaking region in general . There is an elegant simplicity about it , and a hint of reserve . Its songs are soft , beautiful , and expressive , and contrast sharply with the brash , bold northern music often heard at weddings , funerals , and other such functions . Both types of music are very popular in southern Fujian and Taiwan .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
According to Zhang Weining , producer for the popular mainland singer Tian Zhen , " A-Mei 's performance style is suited to the outgoing , unrestrained character of the northern Chinese . " He feels that A-Mei is one of the few performers in pop music with a distinctive personal style .  
In Guangzhou , the ideal of constitutional politics was never realized . The government system there changed frequently and proved to be no more stable or capable than the northern regime .  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
Because the royal Li family of the Tang dynasty were descended from western and northern minorities , the Tang dynasty was deeply influenced by their culture , and the hunks of the Tang dynasty were all tall and broad-shouldered with strong physiques . These energetic men were excellent riders , archers , martial artists and swordsmen .  
Stained glass windows were a prominent feature of northern Europe 's gothic churches , while the walls and domes of the Byzantine churches of the south of the continent were decorated with biblical tales rendered in mosaics of multicolored glass tiles .

In the 1960s , encouraged by a government-sponsored campaign for a renaissance of Chinese culture , many official buildings were built in a style reminiscent of the ornate , solemn palace architecture of northern China , and for occasions such as National Day , Taiwan Retrocession Day and Constitution Day , Chinese-style ceremonial arches would be put up over the entrances to government agencies and across major roads .  
When you first enter the Taipei Sea World , inside the large tank , visible through the transparent glass , sea creatures of brilliant colors and strange movements meander through the blue water . Recent special exhibitions have featured the delicate , translucent Clione lima-cina ( known variously as the sea angel , sea butterfly , and " angel of the floating ice " ) from the North Pole , and the awesome giant northern sea octopus . The aquari-um 's undersea tunnel makes visitors feel even more that they have entered another world .  
With their relatively low moisture content , the woody structure of Formosan acacias possess just the right degree of firmness , not at all like the damp and spongy wood of the Okinawa pine or the gunpowder trees commonly seen in rural northern Taiwan . The lower moisture content makes the heartwood of the acacia resistant to parasitic insects , allowing it to remain standing long after the tree 's outer layers have rotted away .  
Former president Lee Teng-hui was a devout Presbyterian who said more than once that he planned to do missionary work after he retired from politics . In the early morning three days after his election , current ROC President Chen Shui-bian went to the Nungchan Temple in northern Taipei , where he visited Master Sheng Yen . Chen revealed that he had come there previously to meditate and listen to the master 's enlightened words after Chen had failed in his bid to be reelected as Mayor of Taipei City .  
Where they had once viewed the island as a convenient port of call for their merchant vessels , they now schemed to take complete control . Awakened to the dangers posed by aggressive foreign powers , the Qing court dispatched Shen Baozhen in 1874 to develop Taiwan 's infrastructure and strengthen its defenses . The work started by Shen was continued by Ding Richang , who arrived in 1876 . In order to make sure that foreign powers would n't have any further opportunity for incursions into northern Taiwan , Shen had Taipei elevated to prefectural status .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .  
Taiwan , sitting at the intersection of the world 's largest continent with the world 's largest ocean , as an island with numerous mountains , has climatic zones ranging from the tropical to the temperate .

Outline : Some Amis who have come from Hualien and Taitung to seek work in the urban areas of northern Taiwan , but who can not forget their ways of living close to nature back home , have chanced to come together and settle on some unoccupied land behind Yuan Ze University in Chungli , Taoyuan County . Here over ten families work , fish , gather vegetables , chat and sing together . The contrast between their uncertain future and their happy-go-lucky attitude of living in the present adds a poignancy to otherwise amusing events .  
Any performer who got a bit careless might find himself labeled a " saboteur of the model operas . " They took to singing in the very high-pitched falsetto of Peking Opera , while the costumes and makeup were based on Yue Opera . As a result , gezai xi gradually lost its distinctive character , and came more and more to resemble Peking and Yue Opera . There was also the problem of tailoring southern opera for a northern audience .  
The false cypress forests which bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing Taiwan 's fragmented earth , also form a safety valve for the Shihmen Reservoir , Tanshui River and Lanyang River on which the people of northern Taiwan depend for their drinking water . The band of cypress forest that runs from Mt . Chilan to Mt . Lala forms a huge natural reservoir that soaks up heavy rainfall and releases it in gentler flows while keeping the soil firmly in its grasp , in a way that no human engineering project could replicate .  
The lava pushed up by volcanic activity around the main island of Taiwan was mainly composed of andesite . Molten andesite has a relatively higher content of silicon dioxide , so is more sticky . Thus it more readily forms into conical mountains such as the Tatun volcanic mountains of northern Taiwan . The basalt rocks of Penghu form a stark contrast to the geology of the main island of Taiwan .  
Because of Taiwan 's unique soil and climatic conditions , the island is extraordinarily rich in wild fungi . To date over 5300 mushroom species have been recorded here . In terms of global distribution , the species of fungi found in Taiwan can be divided into those that are found worldwide , those found in the northern hemisphere , those found in tropical and subtropical regions , those found in temperate and alpine regions , and those that are unique to Taiwan .
