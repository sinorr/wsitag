Xinhua News Agency , Shenzhen , September 12 ( Reporter : He Guanghuai ) - Shenzhen will adopt the franchise method to attract more capital from the society and overseas to participate in the development and operation of public service industries .  This will include sewage water treatment , living garbage treatment , environment / sanitary service and medical garbage processing etc .  The objective is to accelerate the migration of municipal and public service industries to a market economy model .  The process can also improve the development level of Shenzhen as an international city .  
- - Operate in real accordance with international practices .  Take the internationally prevailing " Free Trade Zone " as a reference objective .  Adopt " inside the territory but outside the customs " as the jurisdiction model .  Gradually realize the free circulation of personnel , goods , funds between the zone and overseas , and realize full coupling with international markets .  
At the same time , one must also consider the increasingly growing trend of increasingly close international economic interaction and international investment , service trade , etc . , improve and perfect trade statistical methods , make statistical data objective and realistic , create good conditions for mutually beneficial co-operation among various countries of the world and healthy development of world economic trade .  
To address the objective reality of China 's scientific and technical journals , the scientific funding magazine department of the National Commission for Natural Sciences Funding , in April 1999 organized and convened an international symposium on " Raising the Overall Quality of China 's Scientific and Technical Periodicals " .  The scientists and personages from publishing circles who participated in the symposium concluded for the most part that in the future , the development of China 's scientific and technical magazines most certainly must follow " planned birth , " with the focus on raising quality .  
At present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .  We must vigorously promote drumming up enthusiasm , promote seeking real results , and promote training solid skills , thereby truly make raising combat effectiveness of military units the objective and result of science and technology training of troops .  
Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
To meet the need of the continuous development of reform , opening up and modernization drive , the NPC Standing Committee timely made revisions on related laws , such as the Income Tax Law , the Highway Law , the Criminal Law and the Company Law . As a result , those laws have become more suitable to objective reality and can play more active roles in regulating social and economic activities .  
At the same time , in order to enhance the consciousness , foreseeability , and effectiveness of practical activities , we should base all major policy decisions on scientific research and adequate proofs ; and base all scientific forecasts and management on a correct understanding of the objective law of the society .  
the western regions have been under large-scale development ; the country 's opening up has been expanding with each passing day ; and the day of acceding to WTO [ World Trade Organization ] is drawing near all these have provided implementing the strategy of national rejuvenation through science and education with a limitless objective demand , an inexhaustible internal motive force , and a favorable external environment .  
In view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .  
It was based on such thinking that Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the three-step strategic objective of our country 's modernization construction : from 1980 onwards , using 10 years to double gross national product so as to resolve the problem of food and clothing ;  
Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the plenary meeting of the PLA delegation enunciated the great historic mission shouldered by our Army in the new period from the lofty strategic point of view for achieving the grand objective of realizing our Army 's modernization , and set forth new requirements for comprehensive advancement of our Army 's building and reform .  
Hegemonism is also manifest in the fact that the US annual Country Report on Human Rights Practices ignores the objective fact that human rights in China are improving all the time , and shows serious political bias in yet again attacking China at great length .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
To be sure , Tibet 's falling behind by far the country 's average development standard is due to both historical and natural factors .  However , we must not lay the blame on objective factors alone .  After all we need to calmly and realistically analyze subjective and operational factors as well .  
The Kosovo war initiated by the United States and other NATO countries did achieve the strategic objective of weakening the FRY , but it has also produced the effect of supporting and encouraging international terrorism and national splittist forces , throwing the world into greater disturbance .  Western countries will also have to eat their own bitter fruit .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
It is necessary to further clearly define the major objectives , basic tasks and major principles and policies for developing the minority nationalities areas , and promote population , resources , environmental , as well as economic and social development in a coordinated and stage-by-stage manner and with an objective in mind . "  
Through steadily carrying out this work stage by stage , we should strive to achieve initial results in five years , achieve noticeable results in 10 years , comprehensively develop the economic and social undertakings in the border areas , realize a long period of order and stability , prosperity and progress in the border areas , and attain the objective of " enriching the people , rejuvenating the border areas , building a strong country and remaining on friendly terms with the neighbors . "  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
Without regard to objective conditions , some harassed the people and wasted money .  Being anxious to achieve quick success and get instant benefits , some sought temporary effects at the expense of long-term and overall interests .  
When many people regarded " globalization " as an inexorable " objective trend , " a German academic soberly analyzed that the " close connection of the global economy is by no means a natural result , but the result of an intentional practice of a policy to chase the set objectives . "  
The publication of this yearbook filled a major void in China 's human rights theoretical building , provided authoritative materials for the international community to understand China 's views on human rights and China 's human rights reality , and provided effective objective facts and theories to refute international hostile forces ' distortion of and attack against China 's human rights conditions .  
He pointed out : To promote socialization of social welfare is an inevitable requirement of the socialist market economy system ; a measure to meet the challenge of aging of the population , to meet the urgent need of speeding up the establishment and improvement of a senior citizens ' welfare service system , and to meet the objective demand of the progress of modernization and particularly urbanization ; and an effective way to rapidly alleviate the current contradictions between supply and demand in social welfare .  
The " Program " has put forward the overall objective and subordinate objectives for the educational reform and development of military academies in the coming decade , clearly defined the guiding ideology and the development principle for the work , drawn the outline of an educational system in military academies which enjoys the special characteristics of our army , and has put forward a series of mutually supporting and mutually dovetailing major reform measures .  
As soon as Putin was appointed acting president , he announced that the priority objective of Russia 's foreign policy was to enhance cooperation with Central Asian countries , showing an evidently strengthened trend of Russia " moving again close " to Central Asia .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
We need both an overall objective for the entire military and focused practical missions for all military branches and theater troops , confirming different separate goals , remembering not to blindly push for expediency , or go into grandiose projects .  
The surpassing road selected by the strategy of " three steps forward " means that , observing objective laws , one can pursue development in strides , skipping over stages .  It does not , however , set false objectives and diverge from reality , or mean that development in strides means arbitrarily skipping over certain necessary developmental stages , or inappropriately raising the objectives of the next stage of development .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
At present , our country 's socialist modernization construction is right in a critical period .  Restructuring state-owned enterprises , helping the poor and storming heavily fortified positions , completing the " Ninth Five-Year " plan , realizing the objective of comfortably well-off , and a series of important issues in the reform and development all need to be studied and resolved .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
Therefore , we should guide our youths to incorporate their individual ideals into the common ideal of the entire nation , and to draw up a long-range objective for turning themselves into useful people ; and only in this way can we successfully arouse the tremendous and long-lasting enthusiasm of the vast numbers of youths in turning themselves into competent and useful people .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
We must prevent trouble before it appears , must eliminate the wrong thing as soon as they begin to crop up , must not allow them to spread unchecked or swell viciously , must not allow them to confuse people 's minds and disrupt our overall situation .  Thus , we can lay a solid ideological foundation for achieving the party 's general objective and fulfilling the party 's general tasks in the initial stage of socialism .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .  Exaggerating differences and inciting antagonism can only deceive the people for some time and can not deceive them forever .  
We soon had an interview with Che Guevara , and obtained a lot of inside information from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , head of the daily newspaper Hoy . Confined by objective historical conditions and delicate and complicated international relations , however , we found that many of the questions could not be reported openly .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
In his " On New Democracy " , written in his Yanan days , Mao Zedong put forward this slogan : " A national , scientific , popular new democratic culture . "  He defined the characteristics and direction of China 's new culture in terms of " science " and put forward the following definition of " scientific : " " It means opposing all feudal thought and superstitious thought , advocating the seeking of truth from facts , upholding objective truth , and insisting that theory and practice be consistent with each other " .  
At present , momentous economic globalization and new technology revolution have raised the economy of mankind to a higher level , and has also provided a rare opportunity for our country 's economy to reach the world advanced level .  On the other hand , with 50 years of accumulation and , especially , development of the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , we have acquired favorable conditions for accelerated development , in both objective and subjective terms .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
Zhou Yongkang said : According to the arrangements made by the Sichuan provincial party committee and provincial government , in the next 10 years , Sichuan 's general objective of speeding up economic development is to build up an ecological shield in the upper valley of the Chang Jiang , effect coordinated economic and social development , and make development by leaps and bounds to turn Sichuan into an economically advanced province . 
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
In conclusion , Yang Chuantang said : The people of various nationalities in Tibet are confident in seizing the historic opportunity brought along by the large-scale development of the western region to speed up development , to narrow the gap between Tibet and fraternal provinces and municipalities , and to fulfill the grand objective of entering the front ranks of China 's drive for socialist modernization , an objective set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
Even though the socialist movement experienced grave setbacks , its banner was still flying high above the Earth . These are not random historical phenomena but a vivid embodiment of an objective regularity of social development .  
At the same time , understanding and mastering these laws is a process where subjective and objective factors converge .  In reality , this convergence frequently has experienced the interference and impact of various factors .  That is why mastering the laws of the building of socialism takes repeated exploration and experimentation and is a historical process that is sure to be prolonged and complicated .  
Dialectical materialism adheres to the unity of material and spirit , emphasizes the decisive role played by material product in the social development and gives full light to the active role played by spiritual strength in the course where people reconstruct the objective world .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
In just three weeks after President Bush entered the White House , he was anxious to increase military spending again .  The objective is to make the United States , which presently holds the largest store of nuclear weapons and the world 's most advanced and strongest standing military , always capable of maintaining its absolute military dominance , as well as further distance itself from all other major countries ' military capacity and consolidating the US position as the world 's " only superpower " .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
To ensure sustained development and realize the third step strategic objective for economic and social development , we should always stick to the established basic national policy and seriously handle the relations between economic construction on the one hand and population , resources , and environment on the other .  
To turn the grand blueprint of the " 10th Five-Year " Plan into brilliant reality and to realize the objective of modernizing national defense and the armed forces , we need to vigorously promote the unremitting fighting spirit and always maintain an elated mental state .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
The conference demanded that the whole party and all levels throughout the country make common efforts and devote great energy to resolve the current conspicuous problems in public order , resolutely achieve the objective of bringing about a marked turn for the better in public order within two years , properly ensure that the masses can live and work in peace and contentment , properly preserve the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and provide an effective guarantee for socialist reforms and opening up and modernization .  
However , to meet the need of its strategic objective of becoming the sole superpower dominating the world , the United States is still stubbornly sticking to the Cold War mentality and regards it as a basic method for handling and resolving international issues .  
Jiang Zemin said : China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace .  Its basic objective is one of safeguarding the country 's sovereign independence , territorial integrity , and national dignity , as well as one of opposing hegemonism , safeguarding world peace , promoting common development , and building an international environment of long-term peace and stability for China 's reforms , opening up and modernization drive .  
Fourth , judging from objective important condition , an international illegal act is a kind of concrete act that violates international law and results in some kind of social harm .  The act is mainly being unlawful , being harmful , being concrete , and consists of other essential acts .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .  
The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .  
To smoothly accomplish the Tenth Five-Year Plan , achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and basically realizing socialist modernization in the middle of this century is the glorious and arduous historic mission for the working class and the broad working masses in our country .  
The judicial administrative departments and all police officers and public security cadres must seriously study the spirit of the work conference , take the initiative in plunging into the hard-striking anti-crime struggle and various tasks for the comprehensive maintenance of law and order , and make contributions to achieving the objective of markedly improving the law-and-order situation within two years as required by the central leadership .  
It is essential that strategic studies cater to the objective requirements of future military struggles and involve planning for building up military strength , with special emphasis on putting forward overall requirements for promoting rapid progress in building up military strength .  
According to the experts attending the seminar from home and abroad while summing up the successful experience in the operation of China 's monetary policies over the past few years , there are some essential characteristics as follows : First , the principle of moderation has been adhered to , that is , the stabilization of currency value has been taken as the most important objective and the relationship between the prevention of financial risks and economic growth has been correctly handled ;

Huang Ju pointed out the respective advantages enjoyed by Shanghai and Taiwan in developing the economy , saying that the two economies are greatly complementary , and that further stepping up economic exchanges and cooperation between Shanghai and Taiwan is not only in accord with the objective requirements for the two regions ' development but also in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  
In conducting education and training of middle-aged and young cadres , we must pay close attention mainly to two things : One is that we must help them master the basic tenets of Marxism , get a clear understanding of the objective laws governing the development of human society , and buttress confidence in taking the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics , and guide them to emancipate the mind , use their brains , conduct new explorations in the light of new realities , and promote innovations and development in Marxist theory .  
However , at least before the election to be held by the end of this year , the current relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong suffers from no immediate and obvious conflict of political interests nor any unfavorable subjective and objective factors to their interactions .  Even if Lee Teng-hui vigorously reveals that the main character of the scandal of Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corporation is in fact Lien Chan , it still can not undermine the present relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong .  
The institute 's objective is : On the basis of the country 's basic national policy of carrying out reforms , opening up to the outside world , and building a market economic system , it will serve China 's modernization drive by engaging in comprehensive studies of WTO-based multilateral trade systems and international issues about economic integration , globalization , and economic and trade policies of all countries .

In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .  
The objective of the Fourth 5-Year Plan on Law Popularization is to realize " two points of improvement " and " two transformations . "  The two points of improvement refers to , in light of the principle of our constitution and the development progress of socialist democratic legal construction in the new development stage , profoundly promoting educational activities to disseminate the law and comprehensively improve the legal quality of all citizens as a whole , particularly leading cadres at all levels .

Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
When practical problems faced by the masses are solved , their ideological problems will be solved immediately .  The majority of officers and soldiers will have a stronger conviction in firmly trusting the party , loving the party and being firm in following the party .  In this way , our planned objective of promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members will be realized .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .  
The Chinese government will continue to make development the main theme , make structural adjustment the main line , make reform and opening up and technical progress the motivation , make raising the people 's living standards the fundamental objective , and industriously take steps forward for economic development and social advance .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
In order to score even greater victories , we must uphold the basic line of the Party , further unify the thinking of the comrades of the whole Party on the major policy decision made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , consciously maintain a high degree of ideological and political consistency with the Party Central Committee , and coagulate the strength of the people of all nationalities of the whole country around the magnificent objective of realizing the socialist modernization construction .  
The course of development of cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation has proved that the economies on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are highly complementary .  The vigorous development of economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and early effectuation of comprehensive , direct " three links " between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait conform to objective economic laws , are in the common interests of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait , and are an inevitable trend in the development of cross-strait relations .  
Only in this way can our Party when faced with fierce global struggles , tough challenges and crucial risks and when in battle in over such things as politics , economics , culture and values be permanently successful .  Only in this way can our country better protect its security and interests and develop in accordance with the planned objective .

General secretary of CPC Jiang Zemin pointed out at the meeting that " science and technology is the primary productive force as well an intensified representation and major symbol of the advanced productive force . "  Therefore , we must sharply capture the objective trend , advocate the " two bombs and one satellite " spirit carried on by the old generations of science and technology workers , never giving up pursuing the summit of science and technology .  
The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .  
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina Patricio Echegaray , and the Party 's Secretary for International Relations Athos Fava , said in a congratulatory telegram to Jiang Zemin , " The Chinese Communist Party , established 80 years ago by a small number of revolutionaries in the historically famous city of Shanghai , proposed the objective of seizing political power and establishing socialist society .  It seized power within the relatively short span of 28 years .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .

In recent years , a certain radar regiment under the air force of the Jinan Military Region , paying attention to the fundamental objective of enhancing combat effectiveness , has stepped up equipment management and applied scientific and technological advances in improving the performance of its equipment .  It has made a new breakthrough in improving its equipment management efficiency , training specialized personnel , and raising its maintenance and repair capability .  
We must willingly combine subjective efforts and objective world , theory and practice , and inheritance and development of legacies , deepen our understanding of the laws governing the running of the government by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and human society so that we think and act more in line with the national condition at the initial stage of socialism and the requirements of the development of the times and think and act more in line with the actual conditions in Jiangsu Province and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech indicates that the important " three represents " thinking has become a complete theoretical system , that our party 's understanding of the objective laws governing the building of our party as a ruling party has reached a new level , and that the development of the Marxist theory on party building has developed to a new stage .  
Su Zhirong : In the new era , the PLA has set implementation of military combat preparedness as the primary objective of modernization , with the armed forces building the " two fundamental transitions , " that is : in military combat preparedness , making the transition from dealing with combat situations under normal conditions to achieving victory in combat under conditions of modern technology , especially high technology ;  
The broad ranks of veteran comrades have realized that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech delivered on 1 July contains rich contents and shows great foresight .  Besides systematically summing up our party 's 80-year basic experience and glorious course , the speech comprehensively expounded the important thinking of the " three represents " and further pointed out the historic task and fighting objective of the party in the new century .

The objective of the leading group is to " revamp financial order , perfect the exchange-rate mechanism , regulate the capital market , and improve personnel proficiency . "  
Meanwhile , we must acutely seize the fundamental impetus that the rapid growth of science and technology has given to the world 's productive forces and to the economic and social development of mankind , and must seize the objective trend that new and major leaps will surely emerge during the future development of science and technology ; and we must always pay great attention to closely integrating the need to give play to the advantages of China 's socialist system with the need to master , apply , and develop advanced science and technology .  
He said : Although the Protocol negotiations are now suffering a serious setback , the Chinese side remains convinced that a balanced and effective protocol concluded through multilateral negotiations is not only beneficial to various signatories to the Convention but is also conducive to world peace and security .  As always , the Chinese side will join the various sides in making unrelenting efforts for the realization the common objective of strengthening the effectiveness of the Convention in comprehensive manner .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
The integrated logistics support system 's overall function of coordination , highly efficient sectional function , and powerful regulatory function can make the entire system and all of the various sub-systems train their focus on the objective of support , playing a sustained and highly efficient role to ensure the best result of integration .  
High pressure should also be exerted on criminal offenders and lawbreakers .  The anti-crime campaign must achieve solid results and be carried out with great momentum , thus effectively deterring and frightening criminals and gratify the people , and guaranteeing that the objective of making marked improvements in the condition of law and order set forth by the central leadership will be smoothly achieved .  Second , great efforts should be made to improve routine public order maintenance and crime prevention .  
12 .  Our understanding of the dialectical relationship between the maximum program and minimum program is based on our correct understanding of the objective law governing social development .  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .  In particular , adequate considerations should be given to the natural and geographical conditions and the actual circumstances of various localities .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
Zhu Bangzao said : During his visits , Foreign Minister Tang will extensively exchange views with leaders of the four countries on further strengthening bilateral relations as well as on international and regional issues of common concern , to achieve the objective of enhancing mutual understanding , deepening friendship , widening consensus , and promoting cooperation .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
The United States is the first country to put forward the demand that news reporting should be " objective and fair . "  However , many facts have proven that the US freedom of press adopts a dual standard , is extremely selfish , violates even a minimum standard of fairness and equality , and practices naked imperialist control and rude and unreasonable press hegemony .  
Jiang Zemin noted : Along with the development and deepening of the peace talks in the Middle East , the Middle East peace process is expected to encounter increasingly great difficulties ahead ; and this all the more requires all relevant sides to engage themselves in flexible and pragmatic talks that center around the general objective of realizing peace in the Middle East and bringing benefits to the coming generations , in the spirit of respecting history , facing up to the reality , and having one 's eyes on the future .  
He said : The one China principle is an inevitable conclusion of China 's historical development over 5,000 years , is the objective condition shaped in the history of cross-strait relations , is the basic norm respected and observed by the international community and international laws , and is a fact commonly accepted by the 1.3 billion Chinese people ( including most Taiwan compatriots ) and tens of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .

The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
- - We must uphold Marxism , most importantly upholding scientific tenets and scientific spirit along with the innovative spirit of Marxism , be adept at becoming aware of and studying forward moving new situations and new questions based on changes in the objective situation , continually drawing nourishment from the fresh experiences of the masses created in practice , and continually advancing and improving our work . 
As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
The exposition of " three represents " has pointed out a correct orientation for our realization of the party 's general objective of construction under the new situation , and is therefore a great guideline for our efforts to comprehensively strengthen the party building ; moreover , it will surely guide our way of thinking , and will encourage us to exert ourselves to make the country prosperous and strong , to forge ahead in an innovative spirit , and to build our party into a stronger and more powerful party full of youthful spirit .  
At a joint meeting held between Premier Zhu Rongji and the EU leaders in London two years ago , both parties reached a common understanding on accelerating the negotiation process of China 's accession to the World Trade Organization , ( WTO ) .  They also defined the objective of establishing a long-term and stable constructive partnership between China and the EU .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
The circular urged that all units should treat the process of studying and carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a process of strengthening and improving the army 's ideological and political work .  Guided by the speech , they should further deepen the guiding spirit of the political work for the whole army .  We must make efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological-political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  They should further enhance the inspiring force , rally force , and fighting capacity of the ideological and political work .  
To put it another way , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future , with Marxism as the guide and the training of citizens who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the objective .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .  
Although in each case there are objective and subjective reasons , these cases have something in common : They developed during exceptional times under exceptional conditions , and if they do not pay close attention to improving their quality , they very easily become swell-headed and make wrong decisions .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
The growth rate of investment in capital construction was small in the first half of the year , and no effective forms were adopted to stimulate investment by people in society .  So the growth of such investment was slow , which has not only directly affected the fulfillment of the expected objective for annual investment in fixed assets but expanded the extent of dependence of economic growth on government loans and state investment ;  
We should build the state finance by making it secure , balanced , and strong and should give scope to finance 's macroeconomic regulation and control role , this being an objective and necessary requirement for steadily and healthily developing both the national economy and various social undertakings .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
crack down hard on forged certificates , account books , and accounting and other offences ; regulate the operation of economic notarial social intermediary institutions , strengthen their self-discipline , and provide objective , fair , and efficient intermediary services for society ;  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
Through the " double thinking " education , we should guide people to think out a way to enhance our confidence , vigor , cohesion and fighting power , set a correct direction , objective and working concept for our region , department and organization , and promote coordinated economic , social and cultural development by a higher standard .  
The most prominent characteristics have been : moving steadily , always proceeding on the basis of reality , acting in accordance with objective laws and laws of nature , embodying characteristics of the times , pursuing no rigid uniformity , pursuing no formalistic stuff , and making no making loud noises .  
Zhang Wannian finally said : Let us hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , rally close round the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , carry forward the good traditions of proletarian revolutionaries and strategists of the older generation as required by Chairman Jiang 's three represents instructions , and work hard to comprehensively advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to attain our magnificent and cross-century development objective of building a modern defense and modern army .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
We hope that more figures from American media circles will visit China and promote understanding of China , and also hope that the American media will report on China in objective and accurate fashion , so as to play a still more positive role in promoting mutual understanding , friendship , and cooperation between the Chinese and American peoples , and to push forward the healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations .  
In the several years when Wen Ho Lee was investigated and prosecuted and in the days when the Cox Report was out , some quite reputable media in the United States tore off the " fair , objective , and factual " mask and , totally disregarding the most basic journalistic ethics , showered false accusations on China about the stealing of US nuclear secrets , and fanned up enmity against China among unknowledgeable American people .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .  
This responsible person denied an earlier report carried by the Voice of America on 16 September , which claimed that the Chinese Government had arrested a total of 35,000 " Falungong " members over the previous four months .  He said that " this report does not tally with objective facts , and it is a highly irresponsible act to spread fabricated stories . "  
He pointed out that the fact that Comrade Jiang Zemin had repeatedly emphasized the utmost importance of strengthening party building and the development of personnel of high caliber fully shows that whether in ensuring that socialist cause started by proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation can continue from generation to generation , in ensuring the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country , or in fulfilling the " three-step " strategic objective of socialist modernization , the key lies in the party and in qualified people .  
In accordance with the long-term objective put forward at the 15th CPC National Congress , the major goal for the economic and social development of our country in the 10th Five-Year Plan period is : to maintain a relatively rapid speed in the development of the national economy , to obtain notable results in the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , to remarkably improve the quality of economic growth and efficiency , and to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP of 2000 by 2010 ;  
The " Proposals " reflects the demands of the third-step strategic objective in socialist modernization , the demands of socialist market economic development , the demands of new situations in the new century , and the interests and aspirations of the broad masses .  The entire document is filled with the spirit of emancipating minds , seeking truth from facts , exploring and innovating , and seeking pragmatism .  It has vivid characteristics of the times and is an important document on Marxism .  
The series has a clear-cut theme and rich contents .  It has historical depth , distinguishing features characterizing our times , and a clear objective .  It is effective teaching material for conducting political and quality professional education for cadres .  
Jiang Chunyun pointed out : Implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region is an inevitable requirement for ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy and fulfilling the third-step strategic objective of the country 's modernization drive .  
The theme is aiming at the future , and it is designed to reflect the latest developments and trends of the international and regional situation , meet the objective needs of Asian-Pacific regional cooperation , maintain continuity of the APEC work , respect the APEC 's principle of diversity and consensus through consultation , seek the converging point of the interests of all parties to the maximum extent , and promote common development and prosperity among all APEC members .  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
I sincerely hope that all of you here as well as all investors in Hong Kong will ride the east wind of China 's modernization as it makes big strides forward toward the third strategic objective , ride the east wind of the development of west China , ride the east wind of China 's imminent entry into the WTO , and ride the east wind of Hong Kong 's continued prosperity and stability ; overcome the difficulties that lie ahead ;  
At the National Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Work Conference held in Beijing today , Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , said that the anticipated objective of China 's total import and export amount for 2005 will be $ 650 billion , and that the scale of foreign direct investment absorbed in the next five years will remain at an average of $ 40 billion a year .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Qian Qichen said , back in 1979 , based on the objective requirements of cross-strait economic development and exchanges of various kinds , we proposed the establishment of direct postal , transport , and commercial links across the strait .  It is regrettable that this has not yet been realized due to the obstacles raised by the Taiwan authorities .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
For this reason , the important objective of this year 's economic and trade plans should be supporting the development of high and new technology industries , represented by electronics and information technology industries , and at the same time using high and new technology and advanced applicable technology to upgrade the traditional industry so that information infrastructure and industrialization can be integrated and can promote each other to achieve common development .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
At the meeting , Zhu Rongji pointed out : In the past five years , the people of all nationalities throughout the country were united in brave advancement under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to make great achievements in all areas , fulfill the Ninth Five-Year Plan as scheduled , and successfully achieve the second-step strategic objective of modernization in the face of complex international and domestic situations .  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
He pointed out : Despite the complex and changeable situations at home and abroad in the past five years , China has achieved enormous economic and social successes that have attracted world-wide attention , and has triumphantly accomplished the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the second-step objective set for the country 's modernization program .  
Deputies expressed the view one after another : With the solid foundation laid in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period and a practical program for development , the people across the country , full of confidence , will certainly be able to make ever greater and more brilliant achievements while advancing toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive on the new march .  
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
I believe that in the course of implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan and realizing the third strategic objective in the new century , minority areas can seize the opportunity afforded by the great development of the west to speed up economic development and social progress and raise the living standard of the minority nationalities so as to gradually bring about the common development and joint prosperity of all nationalities . "  
The people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continued to advance along the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , successfully fulfilled the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development , achieved the second-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and laid a good foundation for advancing toward the third-step strategic objective .  
Wang Yunkun said , " In real life , we must take pains to integrate the enthusiasm for accelerated development with the scientific attitude of operating in accordance with objective laws .

" Taiwan 's economic progress over the past thirty or more years has raised living and educational standards and increased the desire of the populace to participate in politics .

Offering Incense , " " Procession , " and " Watching the Show " were all taken in 1935 during a religious festival in Teng 's hometown of Peipu .

On the other hand , however , objective social and economic conditions , the establishment of a democratic model for the populace , and the promotion of rational behavior are especially essential to democracy .

It does the last because it allows ROC citizens to practically comprehend the mainland , and allows the country 's future to be decided by open discussion ; in this way there slowly takes shape a consensus . Given Taiwan 's objective and subjective conditions , there is no way to accept either reunification under Chinese communist rule or absolute independence . It is necessary to undertake , under the current structure , maximum democratization internally and moderate , cautious exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , to achieve the objective of peaceful evolution .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University .

Since Dr . Joseph Needham decided in 1938 to write a systematic . objective and authoritative history of science in China , the Cambridge University Press has published no less than seven large volumes of his Science and Civilisation in China comprising within them some fifteen books .

But one can discover from many popular stories that the Jade Emperor is buy no means beyond anger and fury , completely impersonal and objective , or able to see all the fine points clearly . On the contrary , He is quite " human , " and often becomes angry so that the common people suffer through no fault of their own , or listens to rumors and half-truths .  
A . Because the chairman of the Legislative Yuan has almost no power to decide , added to the fact that there have been a lot of protest incidents , it has been especially difficult these last two years to preside over the Yuan meetings . I have just been trying to play a fair , objective , and occasionally humorous role , to balance and mediate the confrontational situation between the supplementary legislators and the senior legislators , in order to keep the agenda moving smoothly .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
The objective international situation has changed and the Western economies have long been stuck in a period of economic malaise . The Asia-Pacific area , however - - especially the Southeast Asian region , including Indochina , Taiwan , Hong Kong and coastal mainland China - - has produced a rich economic stimulus .

A bird in the bush worth two in the hand : Hsu Cheng , director of the registration department at the National Palace Museum , says that flower and bird painting started growing from thinking about nature in the Tang dynasty , and after a rapid blossoming in the period of the Five Dynasties took to the path of realism , seeking to imitate nature in its mode of representation . With such realism requiring high artistic skills , perfect technique became the objective sought after by artists .  
Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
This combination of Sun 's own words with journalistic evidence to provide both subjective and objective views was extremely well received . But in fact there are very few examples of objectively critical authorized biographies of " big league " politicians . Most authors wishing to write about political figures adopt the second-best approach of collecting material indirectly in a round-about " covert operation . "  
With this objective in mind , the factory ownership accepts fewer orders , begins to take a loss on manufacturing , stops paying annual bonuses , begins shifting workers to unpalatable jobs ( for example , by closing down some of the especially unprofitable lines and shifting the workers to new jobs they will find hard to adjust to , so that they leave " voluntarily " ) , or transfers workers to other factories far away . . . these are all frequently seen " strategies . "  
In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
Such " objective methods " may make hypnosis more acceptable to the general public , but they also limit it to shallower depths . Wang Wu-shih pays special attention to the depth to which Eastern religious devotees delve " to awaken to the truth " : " When people repeatedly enter the subconscious to explore , their quest goes beyond the level of treating emotional problems and disease to probing at the very nature of life . "  
To implement conservation work , one subject must be selected as a first objective . The environmentalist community can deliberate for a lifetime , but the disappearance of animal species from the natural world is like a raging fire , and we must quickly throw the fire alarm . In the midst of all the rush , errors naturally occur . People should learn from mistakes and move ever closer to the ideal .  
Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness . However , given that the detailed evaluations of an institution at the level of the IMDI are not just based on on-paper responses , but rather all have objective standards of evaluation , the responsibilities of the CEPD should be very concrete .  
For the past eight years working in Hong Kong as a lecturer in Art and Design , I have believed quality of creative thinking has to be developed from awareness of our environment .

Just looking at circulation tricks to expand or maintain sales , apart from giving discounts , giving papers away for free is also common , " suggests mass communications scholar Hsu Chia-shih . There is no mutual trust in the newspaper industry , and there is no objective standard to determine " number of newspapers sold . " That is why they are so chilly toward the ABC .  
As for how serious the situation should become before closing schools , Chen Chien-jen , a professor at the Graduate Institute of Epidemiology at NTU 's School of Public Health , pointed out that judgment about the seriousness of an outbreak requires an objective decision based on an understanding of the communicability of a disease , the number and density of people who are infected , and the rate of secondary infection , as well as other epidemiological data , and should not be based on a subjective considerations .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
The primary objective of the ROCSAT-1 mission is scientific research . The satellite carries three payloads : an ocean color imager ( which will send down images for both practical and academic use ) which was jointly designed and built by the ROC and the Japanese company NEC ; a satellite communications experiments payload ; and an ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics instrument developed in conjunction with the University of Texas at Dallas which will provide important data on factors affecting electronic communications .  
During the time of Fan Kuan , artists were neither too close nor too estranged from nature . They neither made dull and painstaking objective facsimiles of the natural world , nor showered their work with their own subjective feelings . Cun and dian brushwork , which were born out of naturalism , would-after Fan Kuan 's day-be employed in works that were more and more subjective and abstract .  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait .

Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
How to distinguish science from non-science is a basic but unresolved issue in the philosophy of science . But when applied to medicine , perhaps this debate tells us that modern medicine should not completely exclude traditional and folk remedies , and that it may not be the only source of objective , universal , correct and valid knowledge .  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices . Only by experiencing culture as far as possible in all its facets and richness can a student discover his own real interests and talents-and then make his own decisions .  
Moreover , both governing and opposition parties endorsed the ideal of a nuclear-free homeland as a long-term goal , with the executive and legislative branches reaching formal agreement on this point on October 13 , 2001 . In 2002 , the Legislative Yuan formally codified a nuclear-free homeland as a strategic objective when it passed the Environmental Basic Law .  
For example , it does not apply to food , agricultural products , or basic necessities . As for conspicuous luxury goods , if a little extra VAT can reduce their attractiveness , so that the money that would have been spent on them ends up in savings , this could achieve the hidden objective of using the tax system to direct citizens ' economic behavior , and would be a good thing .  
Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff . When you factor this into an evaluation of the nation 's stability , you end up having to apply a much more stringent standard to our foreign reserves and foreign debt . Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .

The Organization originated in the post-war era with the main objective of consolidating an international order founded on faith in fundamental human rights , the dignity and worth of the human person ; and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small ; an organization specifically mandated to maintain international peace and security and to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character .

Mohammed Bedjaoui , whose name , renown and work are intimately linked with the noble objective of strengthening the rule of law based on justice and equity , has shared with the Assembly his exemplary reflections , which will naturally find their proper place in the plans being developed by Member States with a view to launching the United Nations into the next century with the certainty of a future that is brighter than the tumultuous past 50 years of its existence . 
Nevertheless , these operations can not be transformed into the Organization 's priority objective ; rather , the essential part of the activities of the United Nations must focus on preventing conflicts that affect international peace and security , and to this end its role as a forum for ongoing dialogue where disputes are discussed and resolved by peaceful means needs to be strengthened .  
A top priority of the programme has been the objective of eradicating poverty from the world as well as the commitment , on the national level , to take decisive action and on the international level to cooperate in the common endeavour to achieve that objective by focusing , both in policies and in action , on dealing with the root causes of poverty and on satisfying the human needs of all .

We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
In this spirit , before I described some specific reform recommendations my delegation is advancing in connection with the current agenda item , it would be helpful to the Assembly 's consideration of these ideas for me to preface them with four essential points : the diagnostic framework ; the historical context ; and the premises and the paramount objective that underlie our proposals .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security .

Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
In pursuit of that objective we have contributed to the exchange of information and expertise in the various areas of development ; we have opened our markets to free international trade ; we have established the Abu Dhabi development fund to make concessional loans to developing countries ; and we have participated in the provision of assistance through regional and international bilateral and multilateral development institutions .  
We therefore consider it our obligation to reiterate once again that the ultimate solution to the problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices in various parts of the world is to achieve a complete ban on the production , stockpiling , exporting and proliferation of this type of inhumane weapon , and the future efforts of the international community must be directed towards this objective .

With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
The agenda item entitled Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons has been under consideration for several years in our Commission . For various reasons , the Commission has been unable to formulate a set of satisfactory guidelines for nuclear disarmament , thus falling short of people 's expectations .

His delegation was convinced that the duration of the Treaty and its subsequent extensions should be explicitly linked to progress in nuclear disarmament and , more specifically , to the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty as a short-term objective .

However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .  
In order to implement commitment 2 of the Copenhagen Declaration , Mexico has accepted the imperative ethical , social , political and economic need to overcome poverty by taking vigorous action , with the main short-term objective of mitigating the effects of deficiencies and the long-term aim of establishing conditions for the sustained reduction of economic and social inequality .  
It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .  
Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
After the election in September 1992 , Angola was once again plunged into a war that forced all Government activities to be directed at an emergency social policy , the sole objective of which was to mitigate the nefarious consequences that afflicted the lives and dashed the hopes of Angolans .  
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The ideal way of achieving this objective is not by applying arbitrary measures in the form of cutbacks , mass dismissals or redeployment , but by applying the guidelines of the General Assembly on personnel issues consistently , while observing and bolstering the principle that the Secretariat must be accountable in a strict and transparent fashion for the execution of the mandates entrusted to it by the Organization 's only universal organ that is , the General Assembly .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members . The ultimate objective of reform can not be reduced to cutting costs or just addressing the current financial crisis .  
Certainly , the logic of evolution and the rules of transformation indicate that the stages of change carry within them a potential risk as well as elements of rivalry , unless an objective and conducive environment exists , accompanied by a forward-looking vision and a set of highly advanced values that are crystallized through coordinated and concerted efforts . 
While Pakistan is fully supportive of the efforts being made by the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan , it is the fervent hope and expectation of my delegation that the mandate stipulated in the resolution will be interpreted in a pragmatic and flexible manner by the Special Mission , with the objective of realizing durable peace and national reconciliation in Afghanistan as soon as possible .  
The remaining operative part calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to the objectives and to relevant existing treaties , and urges them to keep the Conference on Disarmament informed of the progress of any bilateral or multilateral negotiations relating to the prevention of such arms races so as to facilitate its work .

Also recommends that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
One key objective of advocacy is to create a supportive and enabling cultural , social and political environment for reproductive health .  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
Responding to questions raised by the Committee with respect to article 1 , she noted that exemptions from the principle of equality were based on objective criteria and precise rules formulated as laws following broad consultations with institutional and other partners .  Their purpose was to permit certain territorial adaptations in the organization of the principles recognized in the Constitution ; the principles themselves could not be changed .

NULL  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .

The United Nations , which is responsible for implementing the settlement plan and interpreting its provisions , maintains that anyone who has submitted an application is an applicant and is entitled to be identified by means of a neutral and objective procedure which is " firstly , to establish the personal identity of the applicant and , secondly , to determine whether he or she qualified for inclusion in the electoral roll under one of the five eligibility criteria . 
To that end , the objective is to enhance the capability of the Governments of the region to formulate and implement policies and actions to strengthen the technological dimension of productive activities , increase competitiveness , eliminate bottlenecks in the key factor markets - mainly in the area of human resources , physical capital and export promotion policies - and stimulate entrepreneurial development ;  
The fourth objective is to promote the establishment of regional institutional mechanisms to guarantee the full collaboration and participation of women in the main spheres of economic , political and social development .  
The fifth objective is to facilitate appropriate follow-up and complementary work to the United Nations International Drug Control Programme studies and research and analysis of the economic and social impact of drug production , trafficking and consumption , as well as formulations of alternative development programmes to remedy this impact , and to provide technical assistance in the formulation of national policies to prevent and reduce the production , trafficking and consumption of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances .

The secretariat for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction has continued to support and coordinate the implementation of the Decade 's targets and its overall objective of reducing , through concerted international action , the loss of life , material destruction , and social and economic disruption which occur as a consequence of natural disasters .  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
In any event , this objective will have to be pursued while preserving the current capacity of the text-processing units to ensure the timely issuance of documentation in all languages simultaneously , working with generally very short deadlines and operating within the present framework of reduced staff resources and drastic limitations in the use of overtime .  
At national , subnational and local levels capacity-building is a key objective for several reasons : ( a ) forest management action is effected at these levels , ( b ) many countries do not have the institutional capacity to design and to implement strategies for the management of their forest resources , and ( c ) FAO and other international organizations concerned depend for their data collection on information that countries have already collected for their own purposes .  
The Intergovernmental Panel on Forests may wish to endorse this process and encourage the parallel and cooperative development of existing and proposed international schemes , as well as national and regional schemes , with the overall objective of achieving international harmonization and mutual recognition of standards .  
It is truly regrettable that the Security Council , which bears special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security , should see fit to delete these items without heed for their objective and historical value and without prior consultation with the States concerned .  
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .

In addition , the Council decided that " the Group should meet for a period of two weeks not more than once a year and should report to the Commission on Transnational Corporations on further steps to be taken in pursuit of the long-term objective of the international harmonization of accounting and reporting within the scope of the work of the Commission , particularly with regard to the comprehensive information system and the code of conduct on transnational corporations currently being formulated , on the understanding that duplication of work should be avoided " .  
The majority of the Expert Group concluded that while changes in the direction of harmonization with the 1993 SNA and BPM5 may be introduced , radical and rapid change is not possible because of expected continued reliance on customs-based documents that record the movement of goods across borders as the most common source of data .

The basic objective of the project is to contribute to the progressive elimination of opium cultivation by the Hmong ethnic group in a remote area through the introduction of sustainable social and economic development processes ;  
Although it had been said that global economic growth was the result of the globalization of the economy , the international community should be fully aware that that process was limited largely to interaction among the private sectors of those countries , and that their sole objective was to make profits .  
Despite the continuing invasion and occupation of a substantial part of its territory , Cyprus was a sponsor of various useful meetings and seminars dealing with a wide range of economic and development issues , and , in that connection , his delegation agreed that a " new and equitable partnership " must be based on equality and that economic cooperation for development must be the central objective of that process .  
Further deepening of the development process would require an internationally agreed framework that would facilitate the stable , non-discriminatory and reasonable access of developing countries to technology , on the basis of a more transparent , critical and objective evaluation of the restrictions imposed on the grounds of alleged " dual use " .

Assistance in the legislative process , especially with regard to the following areas : ( i ) right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country ; ( ii ) equal access to public service ; ( iii ) criteria of democratic elections ( e.g . universal and equal suffrage ; the secrecy of the ballot ; respect for freedom of opinion , expression , information , assembly and association ) ; ( iv ) independent review of alleged irregularities ; and ( v ) objective and independent electoral administration ;  
To inform , to educate and to generate public understanding of the importance of and support for multilateral action , including action by the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament , in the field of arms limitation and disarmament , in a factual , balanced and objective manner , particularly through the continuing publication in all official languages of The United Nations Disarmament Yearbook and the Disarmament Review , as well as the updating of the Status of Multilateral Arms Regulation and Disarmament Agreements ;  
The attainment of that objective required good governance , which could be defined as government that was honest , open and equitable , that provided public institutions which were stable , responsive and reliable and that was transparent , representative , accountable and restrained .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
It is further recognized that such improvement of the quality of emission data , in addition to improving the transparency and comparability of national emissions inventories , also improves knowledge of the relationship between global emissions and resulting atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases , and therefore aids significantly the task of estimating the emission limitations or reductions required to achieve a given concentration level of greenhouse gases , the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;

Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Finally , once the target has been identified , a plan of action needs to be developed to meet the objective ; section III thus gives an integrated presentation of ISWGNA work programmes , highlighting recent achievements and reviewing proposed priority areas for future work in the light of expressed country needs .  
It is noteworthy that , in the absence of clearly defined objective criteria concerning cases which the Committee may decide to include in its summary , publication should be restricted to exceptional situations , such as cases in which a State party might refuse to reply to the Committee 's inquiries , to provide it with the information and details that it requires or to cooperate with it , and in cases where there is coherent legal evidence that torture is being practised systematically in that State party .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
To inform , to educate and to generate public understanding of the importance of and support for multilateral action , including action by the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament , in the field of arms limitation and disarmament , in a factual , balanced and objective manner , in particular through the continuing publication in all official languages of The United Nations Disarmament Yearbook and the Disarmament Periodical , and the updating of the Status of Multilateral Arms Regulation and Disarmament Agreements ;

Bearing in mind that the objective of those programmes is to develop within each country a national mechanism to manage and execute an integrated programme of mine clearance and that , as a consequence of armed conflicts , the affected countries are facing considerable economic constraints , only the effective contribution of the international community can enable us gradually to overcome the serious problems caused by existing landmines .  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
ARMITAGE ( Australia ) said that his country acknowledged the obligation of Member States , under Article 101 of the Charter , to ensure the conditions of service necessary to meet the objective of a highly competent , professional and independent international civil service .  
Thus , the special measures announced by ST / SGB / 282 and set out in ST / AI / 412 were developed with the objective of achieving for women equality of opportunity to participate , in the light of the established fact that , since the earliest days of the Secretariat , men colleagues have always far outnumbered their women colleagues at the Professional and , particularly , at the decision - and policy-making levels .  
Following the decision of the Committee to promote international cooperation in space science and technology , the United Nations Programme on Space Applications was established with the objective , inter alia , of providing scientists from developing countries with educational programmes in remote sensing , satellite meteorology , satellite communication and basic space science .  
The Government of Guatemala reiterates that the incorporation of URNG in the political and legal life of the country , under conditions of security and dignity , is in the national interest , given that it is directly related to the objective of reconciliation and the consolidation of a democratic system open to all , and to the contribution of all Guatemalans in building a prosperous country , a just and equitable socio-economic system and a multicultural , multiethnic and multilingual nation ,  
The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
She emphasized that UNEP must emerge as an independent , objective and authoritative organization , equipped and empowered to champion global environmental issues , lead the United Nations in a concerted attack on the worst aspects of global environmental degradation , and develop , monitor and perhaps even enforce international environmental law .  
The Committee will continue , especially during the transitional period and until a fair , satisfactory solution is achieved , to strive to achieve maximum effectiveness in the implementation of its mandate and to adjust its work programme in the light of developments in order to continue to contribute , to the extent possible , to the realization of the common United Nations objective of achieving a just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine .  
In retrospect , the victories of the people , first against the political sleight of hand to stop the elections , and then against the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare away the voters from the polling booths , seem to have left the reactionary forces in our country with only one remaining avenue to their objective , the unconstitutional overthrow of any civil Government , and that was precisely what happened on 25 May . The people of Sierra Leone have responded to the coup in a manner unique in the history of Africa .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
Resolution of this destructive problem requires a determined avoidance of sensationalism and demagoguery on the one hand , and a concerted international attempt to find practical measures to combat terrorism that are reasonable , objective and realistic on the other .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
From the very start of the negotiations , the main objective of many non-nuclear-weapon States was to build into the architecture of the Treaty a renewed commitment by all States , and particularly the nuclear-weapon States , to a progressive and more systematic process leading to complete I repeat , complete nuclear disarmament .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .  
Against this background it is imperative for all countries and the international community to reinstate the attainment of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .  
Such a forum and other appropriate instruments might be based on a framework convention containing flexible rules whose primary objective is to create the appropriate dynamics aimed at the implementation and ongoing consolidation of an international economic environment leading to the exercise by all nations of the right to development and to genuine international peace and security .

The Canberra Commission was a body of independent experts and eminent persons commissioned by the Australian Government to address the fundamental questions of whether a nuclear _ weapon _ free world is feasible and , if so , the measures which could be taken to attain that objective .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .  
Against this background it is imperative for all countries and the international community to reinstate the attainment of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies .  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
The ultimate objective of BITs from the point of view of developing host countries is to contribute to a favourable investment climate , with a view to attracting more FDI flows and , ultimately , advancing the economic and social development of the host countries involved .  
One reason is the objective differences in the curricula offered by different countries / institutions , while another is the resistance of health professional associations to opening the domestic markets to students who have studied abroad , especially when there is no shortage of medical personnel trained in local schools .  
Consequently , there must exist a clear objective - to destroy and to remove an undesirable national , ethnical , racial , or religious group from the population of the State or region either by wholesale physical extermination as such or by the physical extermination of part of the group and forcible expulsion of the others from the defined district , region or State as a whole .  
The premises are thus established for us to attain our main objective , which is the establishment of the true rule of law , under which the individual and collective rights of all citizens will be respected and protected by law , and under which the political differences and the different parties can find in the Parliament an appropriate forum for discussions and review .  
The European Union proposed that the objective would be to focus on strengthening partnership for development and finding new balances in development cooperation ( for instance between multilateral and bilateral cooperation ; between the role of Governments , private sector and civil society ; between capacity building and other forms of cooperation ) by analysing and drawing lessons from changes in the international and national contexts which are relevant for development cooperation .  
The final objective of the report is to signal the challenges to the human rights system posed by the process of globalization , especially in the field of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The main objective of the study should , in its view , be to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant to particular types or categories of such acts . 
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
In view of the current situation in Haiti , so ably described today by the representative of Haiti , we can not but conclude that the primary objective of UNSMIH 's mandate has not yet been fully accomplished , and that sustained international assistance remains essential .

Convinced that the increasing danger of racism and racial discrimination must be met by a concerted response by the international community commensurate with the threat posed to the realization of the objective of the Charter of the United Nations to promote universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,  
The enclosed document , which is prepared on the basis of objective analysis and official sources , intends to set the record straight on a wide range of issues , and thus contribute to a better understanding of the prevailing situations , the facts about the conflict and the general environment surrounding the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
The Seventh United Nations International Training Course on Remote Sensing Education for Educators , held at Stockholm and Kiruna , Sweden , from 5 May to 13 June 1997 , was organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Application in cooperation with the Government of Sweden . The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce remote sensing courses in their respective academic institutions .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Emphasizing the need for accurate , objective and comprehensive information , as well as for a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual countries in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of women migrant workers for policy formulation and joint action ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip Arab societies with an increased capacity to devise and implement measures that can ensure food security at the family level , especially among poor populations , by helping to increase the inclusion of the issue of food security in state economic and social policies , to the extent that they regulate markets , investments and social safety nets , and to develop elements of a coherent system focused on making food available to all .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
The unique advantage of UNDP in this area derives from its extensive field presence in the region , its role as a trusted and objective provider of information and advice and coordinator of United Nations system programmes , its widespread contacts with governmental and non-governmental entities , and its growing body of technical expertise in country offices .  
As many here are aware , it is this objective which has led to Canada and others developing a comprehensive programme for Ottawa this December , when other practical measures will be further elaborated in such fields as demining , victim assistance and social and economic rehabilitation .  
The Rio Group stands convinced that these treaties will not only strengthen the international non-proliferation regime but will also promote the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in other parts of the world , which will lead to the gradual expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones until the ultimate objective of all the States Members of the Organization has been attained a world that is entirely free of nuclear weapons . 
It is our view that we should seek every opportunity in every forum to address the issue of landmines , in the hope that by our concerted and combined efforts we will realize the ultimate humanitarian objective we all share : to bring an end to the dreadful suffering those mines wreak on their innocent victims .  
In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Paragraph 1 ( a ) of the note describes the qualities of the person to assume that position , which include high moral standing and personal integrity ; expertise , including in the field of human rights ; and the general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures necessary for impartial , objective , non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the High Commissioner .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , Alvaro Ramos , said earlier in the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , the international community must continue to encourage direct dialogue between Israel , the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries in order to support mutual recognition and faithfulness to the ultimate objective of a firm and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
Special emphasis is being put on and we have started work towards the reorganization of the army , with the objective of gradually having a smaller , more efficient and professional force under strict civilian control , in conformity with all standards of modern armies , capable of performing its functions properly and of being a genuine partner in partnership activities .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .  
In the debate at this session on proposals for reforming the United Nations , I would like , at the outset , to state that the strategic objective of all of the reforms envisaged must be to provide better conditions for the proper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil its founders ' dream of a lasting , democratic , responsible and credible Organization .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
While it is true that responsibility for social development lies , first and foremost , with States themselves , which have the right and duty to implement appropriate policies to achieve that objective , it is no less true that this responsibility must be assumed , in a spirit of solidarity , by the international community as a whole , not just because of moral and political requirements that are broadly shared today , but also because of the enlightened self-interest of us all .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
This draft resolution accepts my proposal to establish a development dividend funded by administrative savings , thereby reaffirming our collective commitment to the instrumental objective of efficiency as well as the substantive priority of economic and social development .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
Past endeavours have also shown that the primary objective of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is to seek the absence of nuclear weapons from various parts of the world ; to insulate the zonal States from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ; to prevent horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons , which could pose new and unacceptable threats to the security of States ; to contribute to the process of disarmament , especially nuclear disarmament ; and to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
To this end , by agreement between the two Governments , governmental and academic experts from both countries have begun to formulate a binational study on migration , the central purpose of which is to provide an objective , comprehensive and long _ term analysis of migration to be used in designing and enforcing more effective policies that address the real causes and effects of migration .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 163 of 21 December 1993 in which it proclaimed the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People ( 1995-2004 ) , stated that the Decade 's main objective was to strengthen international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health .  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The international community as a whole has taken a stand on this subject , in a virtually consensual manner , in endorsing the objective of a total ban on anti _ personnel mines by a very large majority with no negative votes in United Nations General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 L . As you know , France supported that text . 
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
Agenda 21 has proved to be the starting point for many new business initiatives with sustainability as their stated objective , with notable progress in the areas of joint industry / government partnerships and the development of innovative policy instruments , environmentally efficient technologies and products , and broader sustainability concerns regarding the relation of business and the wider community .  
Whereas : Through the Platt Amendment and its continued intervention and meddling in the internal affairs of the country , the United States of America usurped part of the national territory by installing the Guant \ x { 5ad5 } amo naval base , imposed corrupt and despotic regimes , including the ignominious and bloody tyrannies of Machado and Batista , and since 1959 has systematically attacked Cuba with the declared objective of putting an end to its independence , eliminating Cuban nationality and forcing the population into servitude ,  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
In strategic objective F . 5 , the Platform for Action calls for the elimination of occupational segregation by promoting the equal participation of women in highly skilled jobs and senior management positions , and through other measures that stimulate women 's on-the-job career development and upward mobility in the labour market , and by stimulating the diversification of occupational choices by both women and men ; women should be encouraged to take up non-traditional jobs ; and men should be encouraged to seek employment in the social sector ( para . 178 ( g ) ) .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations . 
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Reiterates that the main objective of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty is to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation in implementing fully and effectively the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments agreed upon at the United Nations major conferences and summits organized since 1990 as they relate to poverty eradication ;  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
In this connection , it is worth noting that during the fifteenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements , some delegations expressed their concern over the tendency of the Centre to spread its resources on activities that were largely tangential to its mandate and expressed the hope that the programme of work would remain focused on human settlements development as its prime objective .  
The objective of the Task Force on an Enabling Environment for Economic and Social Development is to establish a synthesis of best practices or lessons learned in order to clarify the elements of an enabling environment for economic and social development , establish mechanisms for improving inter-agency coordination in support of such an environment , and provide respective constituents with standardized inter-agency performance indicators of social and economic progress that represent the development agenda reflected in the outcome of the major conferences .  
The objective of the case studies was to examine the role of the United Nations system agencies in assisting countries to create an appropriate macroeconomic and social framework , which would entail exploring instances where the successful development of an enabling environment had been enhanced through United Nations system agency support and inter-agency coordination , or where the lack of such coordination proved to be detrimental . 
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Although the distributional impact of harmonized national carbon taxes may be uneven , it could be complemented by allocating the revenue to a trust fund to be used to finance projects for those countries which are overburdened with carbon taxes . 29 The rates should be chosen to meet the carbon emission abatement objective and should be periodically adjusted as more is learned about global warming .  
The main objective of the round table , following-up on the interregional round table held in Toronto , Canada , in September 1996 , was to monitor the manner in which ethical medical directives protected human rights .  
The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
Reaffirms that the objective of capacity-building and its sustainability should continue to be an essential part of the operational activities of the United Nations system at the country level and should be country-driven and situation specific , and should be based on the programme approach , to the extent possible , consistent with national development plans and priorities ;  
The programme translated the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from a rhetorical objective into actual reality , setting forth requirements in terms of active efforts to identify specific measures for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a well-defined time-frame and under effective international control pending the achievement of the desired goals through negotiation .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .  
The expert groups established by the committee had drawn up a national strategy and a triennial plan of action with the objective of guaranteeing the equality of women before the law , the participation of women in all political institutions , an increase in the participation of women in economic activities , the advancement of rural women and support for women in the territories occupied by Israel .  
It also firmly supported the work of the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) as the independent international authority responsible for the objective and balanced evaluation of the efforts of States to establish a global narcotics control policy and genuine international cooperation in that area .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent . 
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 51 / 22 , entitled Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political and economic compulsion , is a timely initiative which aims to address thoroughly the issues of unilateral and extraterritorial measures in a comprehensive and objective fashion .  
The objective of the colloquium was to draw upon the real experiences of high-level executives from developed , developing and transitional economies , in order to extract comparative lessons on impediments to successful public-private partnerships worldwide .  
Although his previous requests have remained unanswered , the Special Rapporteur is still waiting for the existing Government to carry out an independent , neutral , objective and complete investigation into the exact circumstances of the murder of three delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 4 June 1996 , near Mugina , Cibitoke province , to establish clearly who was responsible , and to publish the results without further delay .  
In the face of the intransigent position of the military junta , which has refused to step down , bringing about further deterioration of the situation in the country , which has one of the world 's lowest living standards , and threatening regional peace and security , the Polish delegation believes that the measures recommended by ECOWAS , which the Security Council would take by adopting the present draft resolution , are appropriate for the objective of the expeditious restoration of the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
The Meeting of the Parties shall periodically review the adequacy of the commitments of the Parties included in Annex I or acting under Article 10 , in the light of the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts , as well as relevant technical , social and economic information , with a view to achieving the objective of the Convention .  
The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , adopted on 15 September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women , held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995 , refers to coercive economic measures in a section on strategic objectives and actions concerning women and armed conflict . 11 Under strategic objective E . 3 , paragraph 145 contains , inter alia , the following provisions regarding actions to be taken by Governments and international and regional organizations : 
When economic measures are employed for coercive purposes , instrumental economic effects are obviously their primary objective , which is achieved by restricting the target State 's access to markets , capital , technology and communications .  
In accordance with that objective , Mexican diplomatic and consular offices have a set of legal powers under both domestic and international law for carrying out their protective functions .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
This would achieve the objective sought by the Secretary-General without imposing any artificial delays or changing the standing of the Committee as an expert subsidiary body of the Council .  Yours sincerely ,

I have been struck by the deep historical resonances of this process , for when the United Nations was established at the end of the Second World War , part of its rationale as an organization was to have been the impartial and objective resolution of international problems , free of the old cycles of retribution through resort to aggression .  
A strong and efficient United Nations will allow us to attain the main objective of this initiative : to determine agreed parameters for creating a stable and prosperous world without violence and without war , on the basis of the principles of inter-State relations contained in the Charter , and to find collective responses to the most complicated global challenges .

The " Program " has put forward the overall objective and subordinate objectives for the educational reform and development of military academies in the coming decade , clearly defined the guiding ideology and the development principle for the work , drawn the outline of an educational system in military academies which enjoys the special characteristics of our army , and has put forward a series of mutually supporting and mutually dovetailing major reform measures .  
As soon as Putin was appointed acting president , he announced that the priority objective of Russia 's foreign policy was to enhance cooperation with Central Asian countries , showing an evidently strengthened trend of Russia " moving again close " to Central Asia .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
We need both an overall objective for the entire military and focused practical missions for all military branches and theater troops , confirming different separate goals , remembering not to blindly push for expediency , or go into grandiose projects .  
The surpassing road selected by the strategy of " three steps forward " means that , observing objective laws , one can pursue development in strides , skipping over stages .  It does not , however , set false objectives and diverge from reality , or mean that development in strides means arbitrarily skipping over certain necessary developmental stages , or inappropriately raising the objectives of the next stage of development .  
In the new situation of reform and opening-up and developing a socialist market economy , when the historic topic of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " lies ahead , it is both the earnest expectation of the Party and the masses and the objective requirement for implementing our military 's sacred mission to strengthen the military 's ideological and morality construction and to cultivate revolutionary military professions with the " Four Haves " .  
This important policy decision contains a scientific summing-up of our army 's practice in qualified personnel cultivation in last several decades , a creative exploration of a way to attain the grand objective of cross-century development in our army 's modernization , and a farsightedness which has a bearing on whether or not our army can march in the front ranks of the world military development in the future .  
Treating young officers and solders in the new period , we must understand them with a high period feel and by breaking away from old thinking .  We should see from them their epochal spirit and positive factors , see more of their fine points and less of their shortcomings and see more about the innate character and less from the outside appearance .  Only in this way , can we truly carry out ideological and political work with a definite objective in view .  
At present , our country 's socialist modernization construction is right in a critical period .  Restructuring state-owned enterprises , helping the poor and storming heavily fortified positions , completing the " Ninth Five-Year " plan , realizing the objective of comfortably well-off , and a series of important issues in the reform and development all need to be studied and resolved .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
Therefore , we should guide our youths to incorporate their individual ideals into the common ideal of the entire nation , and to draw up a long-range objective for turning themselves into useful people ; and only in this way can we successfully arouse the tremendous and long-lasting enthusiasm of the vast numbers of youths in turning themselves into competent and useful people .  
among the objective environment and major theories and problems of implementation which affect people 's ideological activities , one is the actual situation where the lightning increase in the total quantity of human knowledge and the rapid breakthroughs in modern technology of the " knowledge economy " which has the entire world as its scope have already shown themselves .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
Judging by its narrative style , the report apparently intended to adopt a purely objective method , such as by stating that " China 's basic national aim is to become a powerful , modern , and unified prosperous country " ; China 's security strategy " is aimed at preserving what it sees as its sovereignty interests in Taiwan , the South China Sea , and other peripheral areas , protecting its economic interests , and also promoting regional stability " .  
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
The General Department of Politics proposed the education 's objective , composed of four aspects , including " strengthening ideals and convictions , putting into full play exemplary models , improving the atmosphere of the grassroots units and fortifying the role of Party organizations " .  This objective embodies the fundamental requirements of the " three represents " imposed on the Party 's basic-level organizations and its members throughout the military .  
We must prevent trouble before it appears , must eliminate the wrong thing as soon as they begin to crop up , must not allow them to spread unchecked or swell viciously , must not allow them to confuse people 's minds and disrupt our overall situation .  Thus , we can lay a solid ideological foundation for achieving the party 's general objective and fulfilling the party 's general tasks in the initial stage of socialism .  
The most fundamental requirement of these is the explicitly stated task for doing ideological and political construction well at military schools in the new situation .  That is : based on " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " , we should ensure the correct direction to build up high-quality military academies and ensure the objective of fostering high-quality military professionals is realized .  
We urge the mass media workers to feel proud of their lofty mission of safeguarding world peace , sow the seed of tolerance and friendliness among the people by means of their hard work every day , and make impartial and objective reports , especially reports on the religious situation in various countries , in order to promote mutual understanding among the people .  Exaggerating differences and inciting antagonism can only deceive the people for some time and can not deceive them forever .  
We soon had an interview with Che Guevara , and obtained a lot of inside information from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , head of the daily newspaper Hoy . Confined by objective historical conditions and delicate and complicated international relations , however , we found that many of the questions could not be reported openly .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
Relying on the correct understandings which are formed in practice , we can make ideological and theoretical judgment through making objective and cool-headed comparisons under richer and as a matter of course more complicated cultural and theoretical background .  This is an indication of the psychological progress of a nation .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .  
In modern history , almost all debates on major issues concerning the country 's development orientation occurred against a background of domestic chaos or external threats or when the nation was facing profound crises .  In such circumstances , people did not have the objective environment for discussing such issues calmly and patiently .  As a result , people could not avoid reaching conclusions leading to rash actions for quick successes and instant benefits at the expense of long-term interests .  
In the wake of the development of the economic structural reform and socialist modernization in China , and in view of objective needs , General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressly pointed out during the 15th CPC National Congress : on the premise that the four cardinal principles are upheld , we must continue to forward the reform of the political structure , further expand socialist democracy , develop a sound socialist legal system , rule the country by law , and build a socialist legal state .  
In his " On New Democracy " , written in his Yanan days , Mao Zedong put forward this slogan : " A national , scientific , popular new democratic culture . "  He defined the characteristics and direction of China 's new culture in terms of " science " and put forward the following definition of " scientific : " " It means opposing all feudal thought and superstitious thought , advocating the seeking of truth from facts , upholding objective truth , and insisting that theory and practice be consistent with each other " .  
At present , momentous economic globalization and new technology revolution have raised the economy of mankind to a higher level , and has also provided a rare opportunity for our country 's economy to reach the world advanced level .  On the other hand , with 50 years of accumulation and , especially , development of the more than 20 years of reform and opening up , we have acquired favorable conditions for accelerated development , in both objective and subjective terms .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
Zhou Yongkang said : According to the arrangements made by the Sichuan provincial party committee and provincial government , in the next 10 years , Sichuan 's general objective of speeding up economic development is to build up an ecological shield in the upper valley of the Chang Jiang , effect coordinated economic and social development , and make development by leaps and bounds to turn Sichuan into an economically advanced province . 
In short , the opportunities globalization provides are objective opportunities , and we must seize these opportunities by participating in the globalization process , especially by joining the WTO , to fully utilize the international and domestic markets and resources , further perfect the socialist market economic system , accelerate the change in the pattern of economic growth and the adjustment of the economic structure , and continuously increase our international competitiveness .  
In conclusion , Yang Chuantang said : The people of various nationalities in Tibet are confident in seizing the historic opportunity brought along by the large-scale development of the western region to speed up development , to narrow the gap between Tibet and fraternal provinces and municipalities , and to fulfill the grand objective of entering the front ranks of China 's drive for socialist modernization , an objective set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
Even though the socialist movement experienced grave setbacks , its banner was still flying high above the Earth . These are not random historical phenomena but a vivid embodiment of an objective regularity of social development .  
At the same time , understanding and mastering these laws is a process where subjective and objective factors converge .  In reality , this convergence frequently has experienced the interference and impact of various factors .  That is why mastering the laws of the building of socialism takes repeated exploration and experimentation and is a historical process that is sure to be prolonged and complicated .  
Dialectical materialism adheres to the unity of material and spirit , emphasizes the decisive role played by material product in the social development and gives full light to the active role played by spiritual strength in the course where people reconstruct the objective world .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
In just three weeks after President Bush entered the White House , he was anxious to increase military spending again .  The objective is to make the United States , which presently holds the largest store of nuclear weapons and the world 's most advanced and strongest standing military , always capable of maintaining its absolute military dominance , as well as further distance itself from all other major countries ' military capacity and consolidating the US position as the world 's " only superpower " .  
Focusing on the objective conditions of limited national investment , and a fairly small number of satellites to design and manufacture , we must correctly select development paths where the technological leaps are the greatest , strengthening the advance research of key technologies , and constantly realizing fairly large technological advances , raising by the greatest margin the level of satellite engineering .  
Especially after the central authorities held the third forum on Tibet work in 1994 , the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and Government gave equal stress to both stability and development in accordance with General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's instruction that " Tibet must definitely not be allowed to split from the motherland and also not be allowed to be backward for a long time , " fulfilled the development objective set by the central authorities for 2000 , and kept the social and political situation stable .  
To realize the goal , it is necessary to make development our key theme , restructuring our key path , reform , opening up , scientific and technological progress our driving force , and raising the people 's standards of living our fundamental objective .  
To ensure sustained development and realize the third step strategic objective for economic and social development , we should always stick to the established basic national policy and seriously handle the relations between economic construction on the one hand and population , resources , and environment on the other .  
To turn the grand blueprint of the " 10th Five-Year " Plan into brilliant reality and to realize the objective of modernizing national defense and the armed forces , we need to vigorously promote the unremitting fighting spirit and always maintain an elated mental state .  
In addition , these leaders should pay attention to following scientific rules , and should not stop at existing theories and understandings when considering the objective reality but rather , in light of the need for winning wars , courageously explore unknown fields , deepen military training through science and technology by means of continuous reform and innovation , and make achievements in this process .  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
Employment of such improper means for security trading may possibly lead to a sustained and artificial expansion of relevant security transaction volumes and a distortion of relevant securities ' purchasing-marketing relations and price changes .  Besides , this may sabotage the objective foundation with which other investors are able to make true judgments .  This may also create a false impression for stock markets and guide or enable investors to make decisions in security investment under the circumstances where they do not understand the true situation .  
This Opinion regards Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " as the guideline , gives an eye on the reality of the party-building in the military and explicitly proposes the guiding principle , fundamental objective , major tasks and detailed requirements on extensively promoting throughout the military an educational campaign to maintain the advanced nature of party members .

However , to meet the need of its strategic objective of becoming the sole superpower dominating the world , the United States is still stubbornly sticking to the Cold War mentality and regards it as a basic method for handling and resolving international issues .  
Jiang Zemin said : China upholds an independent foreign policy of peace .  Its basic objective is one of safeguarding the country 's sovereign independence , territorial integrity , and national dignity , as well as one of opposing hegemonism , safeguarding world peace , promoting common development , and building an international environment of long-term peace and stability for China 's reforms , opening up and modernization drive .  
Fourth , judging from objective important condition , an international illegal act is a kind of concrete act that violates international law and results in some kind of social harm .  The act is mainly being unlawful , being harmful , being concrete , and consists of other essential acts .  
During this ongoing fight against the evil forces , leading party and government comrades must act firmly , take a clear-cut stand , earnestly strengthen their organizational guidance , and carefully plan and organize every move so as to wipe out the evil forces completely , pull up their roots , deal ruinous blows to all forms of evil forces , and create a peaceful and harmonious environment that can facilitate the realization of the grand objective of national revitalization .  
The conference explicitly demanded that the entire party and the whole nation work together and make vigorous efforts to solve the current pronounced problems in public order , firmly achieve the objective of realizing a marked improvement in public order in two years ' time , and provide a powerful guarantee for the socialist reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  
Materialization of such an objective will depend on whether Taiwan can formulate an effective policy toward mainland China , and be conducive to facilitating sustained and stable cross-strait interactions that are based on political mutual trust .  
The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .  
To smoothly accomplish the Tenth Five-Year Plan , achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and basically realizing socialist modernization in the middle of this century is the glorious and arduous historic mission for the working class and the broad working masses in our country .

Huang Ju pointed out the respective advantages enjoyed by Shanghai and Taiwan in developing the economy , saying that the two economies are greatly complementary , and that further stepping up economic exchanges and cooperation between Shanghai and Taiwan is not only in accord with the objective requirements for the two regions ' development but also in line with the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  
In conducting education and training of middle-aged and young cadres , we must pay close attention mainly to two things : One is that we must help them master the basic tenets of Marxism , get a clear understanding of the objective laws governing the development of human society , and buttress confidence in taking the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics , and guide them to emancipate the mind , use their brains , conduct new explorations in the light of new realities , and promote innovations and development in Marxist theory .  
However , at least before the election to be held by the end of this year , the current relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong suffers from no immediate and obvious conflict of political interests nor any unfavorable subjective and objective factors to their interactions .  Even if Lee Teng-hui vigorously reveals that the main character of the scandal of Chung Hsing Bills Finance Corporation is in fact Lien Chan , it still can not undermine the present relationship between Lien Chan and James Soong .

In recent years , in particular , the Western hostile forces have made use of the theories of human rights , globalization , and environmental protection , which are of common concern to the people , to pursue their strategy of westernization and disintegration behind a fashionable facade and under the pretence of the scientific nature of academic research , the objective nature of news reports , and the recreational nature of literary and art works and , for this reason , they are very confusing and deceptive .

Marxism is our guiding ideology on building our party and state , the guide to actions in all our work , the ideological foundation and spiritual motive force pushing people of all nationalities of the entire country to fight for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through concerted efforts , and also a powerful ideological weapon for our efforts to understand the world and to reform the objective world and subjective world .  
From the very beginning , the party openly and explicitly regarded the most beautiful ideal of human beings - socialist society and communist society - as its objective for struggle , employed Marxism as an ideological weapon to sharply observe and analyze issues regarding China , united a large number of advanced people that excel at dedicating themselves to , and deeply went among the workers and the farmers to do the masses ' work .  
When practical problems faced by the masses are solved , their ideological problems will be solved immediately .  The majority of officers and soldiers will have a stronger conviction in firmly trusting the party , loving the party and being firm in following the party .  In this way , our planned objective of promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members will be realized .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to focus on the reality of the primate phase of socialism and the objective existence of the socialist market economy , to be responsive to society 's diversified development , to grasp the mainstream and essence , and to work hard to utilize , incorporate , exploit , and develop positive factors .

Only in this way can our Party when faced with fierce global struggles , tough challenges and crucial risks and when in battle in over such things as politics , economics , culture and values be permanently successful .  Only in this way can our country better protect its security and interests and develop in accordance with the planned objective .

The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .

The anti-crime campaign must achieve solid results and be carried out with great momentum , thus effectively deterring and frightening criminals and gratify the people , and guaranteeing that the objective of making marked improvements in the condition of law and order set forth by the central leadership will be smoothly achieved .  Second , great efforts should be made to improve routine public order maintenance and crime prevention .  
12 .  Our understanding of the dialectical relationship between the maximum program and minimum program is based on our correct understanding of the objective law governing social development .  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .  In particular , adequate considerations should be given to the natural and geographical conditions and the actual circumstances of various localities .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
Zhu Bangzao said : During his visits , Foreign Minister Tang will extensively exchange views with leaders of the four countries on further strengthening bilateral relations as well as on international and regional issues of common concern , to achieve the objective of enhancing mutual understanding , deepening friendship , widening consensus , and promoting cooperation .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
The United States is the first country to put forward the demand that news reporting should be " objective and fair . "  However , many facts have proven that the US freedom of press adopts a dual standard , is extremely selfish , violates even a minimum standard of fairness and equality , and practices naked imperialist control and rude and unreasonable press hegemony .  
Jiang Zemin noted : Along with the development and deepening of the peace talks in the Middle East , the Middle East peace process is expected to encounter increasingly great difficulties ahead ; and this all the more requires all relevant sides to engage themselves in flexible and pragmatic talks that center around the general objective of realizing peace in the Middle East and bringing benefits to the coming generations , in the spirit of respecting history , facing up to the reality , and having one 's eyes on the future .  
He said : The one China principle is an inevitable conclusion of China 's historical development over 5,000 years , is the objective condition shaped in the history of cross-strait relations , is the basic norm respected and observed by the international community and international laws , and is a fact commonly accepted by the 1.3 billion Chinese people ( including most Taiwan compatriots ) and tens of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots .  
- - Looking at the development of productive force and changes in supply-demand relations : After more than 20 years of great development , the era of shortage where the supply of ordinary industrial and agricultural products could not meet the demand has basically ended ; the buyers market has taken shape ; the objective of economic development has gradually shifted from purely pursuing quantity in the past to giving equal attention to quality ;  
In making plans , therefore , we should base ourselves on the present and have our eyes on the future , and combine the solution of the current outstanding problems with the realization of the long-term development objectives .  Our plans should both reflect the spirit of emancipating the mind and positively forging ahead , and conform to the principle of seeking truth from facts and following the objective laws .

The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
- - We must uphold Marxism , most importantly upholding scientific tenets and scientific spirit along with the innovative spirit of Marxism , be adept at becoming aware of and studying forward moving new situations and new questions based on changes in the objective situation , continually drawing nourishment from the fresh experiences of the masses created in practice , and continually advancing and improving our work . 
As a result of Kim T'ae-chung 's visit to North Korea as President , the North and South have formally acknowledged the objective existence of their respective independent political entities ; in addition , mentally redefining each other 's status is beneficial not only for easing antagonism and tension in their relationship but also for establishing a relationship of peaceful coexistence and replacing their cold war relations of more than 50 years with a new relationship of coexistence and common prosperity ;  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
The exposition of " three represents " has pointed out a correct orientation for our realization of the party 's general objective of construction under the new situation , and is therefore a great guideline for our efforts to comprehensively strengthen the party building ; moreover , it will surely guide our way of thinking , and will encourage us to exert ourselves to make the country prosperous and strong , to forge ahead in an innovative spirit , and to build our party into a stronger and more powerful party full of youthful spirit .  
At a joint meeting held between Premier Zhu Rongji and the EU leaders in London two years ago , both parties reached a common understanding on accelerating the negotiation process of China 's accession to the World Trade Organization , ( WTO ) .  They also defined the objective of establishing a long-term and stable constructive partnership between China and the EU .  
Our ideological and political work has not yet adapted to the changing objective circumstances and complicated ideological issues : The problem of " not attaching equal importance to both material and spiritual civilizations " has not been radically resolved in quite a number of localities and departments ; some grassroots party organizations are in a state of weakness and slackness ; problems of unreached areas , unclear goals , and outdated means and approaches are still quite prominent in ideological and political work .  
The circular urged that all units should treat the process of studying and carrying out Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech as a process of strengthening and improving the army 's ideological and political work .  Guided by the speech , they should further deepen the guiding spirit of the political work for the whole army .  We must make efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological-political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  
They should meet the needs of the new situation and new task , make continued efforts to improve and strengthen the ideological and political work .  They must make special efforts to increase the feeling of the current times in our ideological and political work , give it a clearer objective , enable it to produce more tangible benefits , and make it more spontaneous .  They should further enhance the inspiring force , rally force , and fighting capacity of the ideological and political work .  
To put it another way , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that is geared to the needs of modernization , the world , and the future , with Marxism as the guide and the training of citizens who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the objective .  
In advancing the course of urbanization , we must , bearing in mind China 's characteristics as a country with a large population , a high percentage of rural inhabitants and a relative shortage of resources , meet the objective requirements of the process of industrialization and modernization while developing the socialist market economy , rationally plan the pattern , scale and speed of urban development as well as the functions , standards and quality of cities and towns , and take the road of urbanization that suits China 's national conditions .  
We must conscientiously sum up the experience and lessons of our work of urban and rural planning , study and learn from the successful methods of other countries , adhere to the objective laws of urban and rural development , base ourselves on the present situation while bearing in mind future needs , take the interests of all parties concerned into account in making comprehensive plans , and promote the coordinated development of the economy , the society and the environment in accordance with the overall requirements of socialist modernization .  
Although in each case there are objective and subjective reasons , these cases have something in common : They developed during exceptional times under exceptional conditions , and if they do not pay close attention to improving their quality , they very easily become swell-headed and make wrong decisions .  
In vigorously grasping implementation , we must profoundly analyze , from the angle of international and internal history and reality , the objective environment and its basic characteristics which play a role in the ideological activities of the cadres and masses in the new situation , and correctly judge and resolve the major theoretical and practical issues that influence those ideological activities .  
The growth rate of investment in capital construction was small in the first half of the year , and no effective forms were adopted to stimulate investment by people in society .  So the growth of such investment was slow , which has not only directly affected the fulfillment of the expected objective for annual investment in fixed assets but expanded the extent of dependence of economic growth on government loans and state investment ;  
We should build the state finance by making it secure , balanced , and strong and should give scope to finance 's macroeconomic regulation and control role , this being an objective and necessary requirement for steadily and healthily developing both the national economy and various social undertakings .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
crack down hard on forged certificates , account books , and accounting and other offences ; regulate the operation of economic notarial social intermediary institutions , strengthen their self-discipline , and provide objective , fair , and efficient intermediary services for society ;  
The localities generally say that to carry out educational activities on " thinking of the origin after making a fortune and thinking about making progress after becoming rich " meets the objective need of China 's economic and social development , these activities are a profound ideological emancipation and mobilization at the turn of the centuries , and they are the important contents and effective carrier of the efforts to strengthen and improve the ideological and political work under new circumstances .  
Through the " double thinking " education , we should guide people to think out a way to enhance our confidence , vigor , cohesion and fighting power , set a correct direction , objective and working concept for our region , department and organization , and promote coordinated economic , social and cultural development by a higher standard .  
The most prominent characteristics have been : moving steadily , always proceeding on the basis of reality , acting in accordance with objective laws and laws of nature , embodying characteristics of the times , pursuing no rigid uniformity , pursuing no formalistic stuff , and making no making loud noises .  
Zhang Wannian finally said : Let us hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , rally close round the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , carry forward the good traditions of proletarian revolutionaries and strategists of the older generation as required by Chairman Jiang 's three represents instructions , and work hard to comprehensively advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to attain our magnificent and cross-century development objective of building a modern defense and modern army .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
We hope that more figures from American media circles will visit China and promote understanding of China , and also hope that the American media will report on China in objective and accurate fashion , so as to play a still more positive role in promoting mutual understanding , friendship , and cooperation between the Chinese and American peoples , and to push forward the healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations .  
In the several years when Wen Ho Lee was investigated and prosecuted and in the days when the Cox Report was out , some quite reputable media in the United States tore off the " fair , objective , and factual " mask and , totally disregarding the most basic journalistic ethics , showered false accusations on China about the stealing of US nuclear secrets , and fanned up enmity against China among unknowledgeable American people .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .  
This responsible person denied an earlier report carried by the Voice of America on 16 September , which claimed that the Chinese Government had arrested a total of 35,000 " Falungong " members over the previous four months .  He said that " this report does not tally with objective facts , and it is a highly irresponsible act to spread fabricated stories . "  
He pointed out that the fact that Comrade Jiang Zemin had repeatedly emphasized the utmost importance of strengthening party building and the development of personnel of high caliber fully shows that whether in ensuring that socialist cause started by proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation can continue from generation to generation , in ensuring the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country , or in fulfilling the " three-step " strategic objective of socialist modernization , the key lies in the party and in qualified people .  
In accordance with the long-term objective put forward at the 15th CPC National Congress , the major goal for the economic and social development of our country in the 10th Five-Year Plan period is : to maintain a relatively rapid speed in the development of the national economy , to obtain notable results in the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , to remarkably improve the quality of economic growth and efficiency , and to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP of 2000 by 2010 ;  
The " Proposals " reflects the demands of the third-step strategic objective in socialist modernization , the demands of socialist market economic development , the demands of new situations in the new century , and the interests and aspirations of the broad masses .  The entire document is filled with the spirit of emancipating minds , seeking truth from facts , exploring and innovating , and seeking pragmatism .  It has vivid characteristics of the times and is an important document on Marxism .  
The series has a clear-cut theme and rich contents .  It has historical depth , distinguishing features characterizing our times , and a clear objective .  It is effective teaching material for conducting political and quality professional education for cadres .  
Jiang Chunyun pointed out : Implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region is an inevitable requirement for ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy and fulfilling the third-step strategic objective of the country 's modernization drive .  
The theme is aiming at the future , and it is designed to reflect the latest developments and trends of the international and regional situation , meet the objective needs of Asian-Pacific regional cooperation , maintain continuity of the APEC work , respect the APEC 's principle of diversity and consensus through consultation , seek the converging point of the interests of all parties to the maximum extent , and promote common development and prosperity among all APEC members .  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
Hence , the increase of peasants ' income in every possible way should be taken as the basic objective of promoting agriculture and rural economic structural adjustment and the fundamental task of agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and placed in a prominent position of the entire economic work .  
I sincerely hope that all of you here as well as all investors in Hong Kong will ride the east wind of China 's modernization as it makes big strides forward toward the third strategic objective , ride the east wind of the development of west China , ride the east wind of China 's imminent entry into the WTO , and ride the east wind of Hong Kong 's continued prosperity and stability ; overcome the difficulties that lie ahead ;  
At the National Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Work Conference held in Beijing today , Shi Guangsheng , minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , said that the anticipated objective of China 's total import and export amount for 2005 will be $ 650 billion , and that the scale of foreign direct investment absorbed in the next five years will remain at an average of $ 40 billion a year .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Qian Qichen said , back in 1979 , based on the objective requirements of cross-strait economic development and exchanges of various kinds , we proposed the establishment of direct postal , transport , and commercial links across the strait .  It is regrettable that this has not yet been realized due to the obstacles raised by the Taiwan authorities .  
Recently , compelled by the situation , they lifted the ban on direct cargo shipping and visitor traffic between Kinmen-Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian . But this is not direct " three links " in a true sense and can not satisfy the strong wish and urgent demand of the public on both sides .  Furthermore , it lags behind the objective situation where the exchange of visits , economic interaction , and trade between the two sides have been steadily growing .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
For this reason , the important objective of this year 's economic and trade plans should be supporting the development of high and new technology industries , represented by electronics and information technology industries , and at the same time using high and new technology and advanced applicable technology to upgrade the traditional industry so that information infrastructure and industrialization can be integrated and can promote each other to achieve common development .  
Enabling peasants to get rich as quickly as possible is not only an important matter concerning reform , development , and stability in the suburbs of the capital , but also an important matter concerning the overall economic and social development in the capital .  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach great importance to this matter , take it as a top priority and the basic objective of the agricultural and rural work in the new stage , and make great efforts to accomplish this task .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
At the meeting , Zhu Rongji pointed out : In the past five years , the people of all nationalities throughout the country were united in brave advancement under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to make great achievements in all areas , fulfill the Ninth Five-Year Plan as scheduled , and successfully achieve the second-step strategic objective of modernization in the face of complex international and domestic situations .  
Faced with the fact of blood and fire , those who should be condemned are not the ignorant " followers " but the cult ringleader , Li Hongzhi , who has spread fallacies to hoodwink the public and made use of the followers ' fanaticism to create a bloody incident and attain his anti-China political objective !  This person has always hidden himself under the aegis of the Western anti-China forces .  
A not-so-advanced agricultural county has gone so far as to create , by means of giving administrative orders , more than 140 scientific and technological demonstration parks and nearly 2,700 scientific and technological demonstration points in total disregard of either its objective conditions or the bearing capacity of its masses .  Voices of grievances can be heard everywhere among local cadres and masses , and the public are suffering indescribable misery and are all trying to keep clear of the whole thing as much as they can .  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
He pointed out : Despite the complex and changeable situations at home and abroad in the past five years , China has achieved enormous economic and social successes that have attracted world-wide attention , and has triumphantly accomplished the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the second-step objective set for the country 's modernization program .  
Deputies expressed the view one after another : With the solid foundation laid in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period and a practical program for development , the people across the country , full of confidence , will certainly be able to make ever greater and more brilliant achievements while advancing toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive on the new march .  
While attending the discussion meeting of the Jilin delegation , Wen Jiabao , member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice premier of the State Council , said that great importance must be attached to the issue of peasants ' income .  It is necessary to try by all possible means to increase peasants ' income , and take this as the basic objective of doing a good job in the agricultural and rural work in the new stage and put this in a prominent position in the economic work as a whole .  
I believe that in the course of implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan and realizing the third strategic objective in the new century , minority areas can seize the opportunity afforded by the great development of the west to speed up economic development and social progress and raise the living standard of the minority nationalities so as to gradually bring about the common development and joint prosperity of all nationalities . "  
The people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continued to advance along the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , successfully fulfilled the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development , achieved the second-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and laid a good foundation for advancing toward the third-step strategic objective .  
Wang Yunkun said , " In real life , we must take pains to integrate the enthusiasm for accelerated development with the scientific attitude of operating in accordance with objective laws .  We can not stick to the conventional way of doing things , but nor can we rush ahead blindly , kill the goose that lays the golden eggs , or duplicate low-level projects , not to mention merely paying lip service or practicing formalism . "  
We should make it our objective to increase the income of urban and rural population and constantly meet the people 's material and cultural needs , and vigorously promote the comprehensive development of the national economy and social undertakings .  
He added : To achieve the " two higher " objective " and effect restructuring in the five aspects , Henan will give prominence to following eight measures in the course of comprehensively advancing economic and social development : First , build two agricultural bases , turn Henan into the country 's major high-quality wheat production and processing base , and major animal product production and processing base .  
In the new century , international competition will get more and more intense , the reform and construction tasks at home will also be heavy and arduous .  The objective conditions are continuously changing .  If we do not emancipate our minds , do not carry out innovations , then our cause will not be advanced further , and we will not able to meet various challenges .  
It is of great and far-reaching significance for narrowing the gap between the eastern and western regions in development , accelerating the process of China 's modernization drive , achieving the third-step strategic objective in the modernization of our country , promoting the unity and progress of various nationalities , realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , maintaining social stability , consolidating national defense , and achieving the lasting political stability of the country .  
Therefore , whether to sell advanced weapons to Taiwan or to expand Sino-U.S . bilateral trade , whether to condemn China for suppressing human rights or to obstruct China from acceding to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) - - all such means are used to achieve one objective , that is , to change the current social system in China . The United States ' national interests can be satisfied to the maximum only by achieving this objective .  
Further expanding domestic demand will make it possible for us to have the initiative in our hands in developing the economy and maintaining sustained and steady economic growth , and this is also a strategic move in smoothly carry out the 10th Five-Year Plan and fulfilling the third-step development objective .  
Speaking at a ceremony of the Community Building Project " We Build And We Care " in Tseung Kwan O , he said the Government attached great importance to housing issues , especially on how to help ordinary people own their homes at reasonable and affordable prices .  The ultimate objective was to build a society in which people can live and work in peace and harmony .  Mr Tung said the objective was important in enhancing a sense of belonging to the community and maintaining social stability .  
He emphasized that the long-standing objective of the Government was to maintain an overall environment favourable to economic growth , through providing a sound legal and institutional framework , a simple tax system with low tax rate , a stable financial sector , well - developed infrastructure and an efficient Government machinery .  
We are gathered here today for a common objective - international economic and monetary cooperation to achieve stable global development , prosperity and stability .  
" Firstly , the Employees Retraining Board will be running special tailor-made on-the-job retraining programmes for employers on top of its existing courses .  The primary objective of such training programmes is to equip the unemployed trainees with new and transferable skills which will enable them to secure a job , hold down their jobs in the labour market and upgrade their skills in the longer term .  
When making appointments to advisory and statutory bodies , the Government 's overriding objective is to ensure that the best individuals capable of meeting the specific requirements of the concerned bodies are appointed .  
The Government 's policy objective on the environmental well-being of the community is to improve our urban , rural and marine surroundings , conserve our natural heritage , and optimise the use of resources and goods so as to reduce pollution and waste and promote health and the enjoyment of our living environment .  
While we will exert ourselves in achieving this objective , I believe that we also need to take account , in my view , of four main factors which will be crucial to our recovery .  These are : an improvement in the external , financial and economic environment ; a steadying of our interest rates here ; stability in the property market ; and above all , a return of public confidence .  
Commenting on the two electoral bills , the spokesman said : " Our objective is very clear .  We wish to ensure that our electoral systems continues to develop in an orderly and progressive manner in accordance with the blueprint set out in the Basic Law . We wish to enhance our community 's awareness of and participation in elections .  We also wish to ensure that future elections will remain open , fair , clean , honest and acceptable to the community . "  
To meet this objective , we may need to consider steering away from the past approach in which urban renewal had been conducted in a piecemeal manner .  Instead , we will plan urban renewal and rehabilitation more comprehensively for larger areas , with a view to more effectively restructuring and re-planning the old urban areas , re-designing a more effective and environmentally friendly transport and road network , replacing incompatible land uses , adding open space , and designing buildings which meet the demands of modern living .  
At the contract signing ceremony today , the Deputy Secretary for Education and Manpower , Mr Philip Chok said : " The objective of the consultancy is to carry out a comprehensive , in-depth , qualitative analysis of the current manpower monitoring practices adopted by economies at a similar or more advanced level of economic development to Hong Kong and critically assess their relative merits in terms of their application to Hong Kong . "  
However , as the new millennium unfolds and in order to meet the many new challenges which Hong Kong now faces , we are also making a determined effort in civil service reform .  Our objective is to make our civil service even more efficient , accountable and responsive to changing needs .  
On rural elections , Mr Lan said a Government working group is now looking at how current practices can be improved taking into account the dual objective of balancing traditional rural interests and the need for open , fair and clean elections .  
" Regarding market surveillence , intermediaries supervision , compensation arrangements and listing / corporate finance , the proposal now receiving emerging consensus basically represents a logical and natural development from the existing arrangement , having regard to the nature of NewCo . The objective is to reduce regulatory overlaps through clearer delineation and refinement of respective responsibilities , " the spokesman added .  
In Hong Kong , the policy objective of enhancing workplace safety and health is to help business and the duty holders meet their legal , moral and social obligations in reducing work-related injuries and diseases .  The strategy used is preventive rather than curative , promotional and educational rather than prosecution-oriented .  
HKSARG came to know of this problem as a result of active research .  We have made reference to the official and other objective evidence obtained from concerned international authorities and countries and conducted detailed professional analysis before the relevant decisions were made .  
Mr Ip said , " Hong Kong is ideally located to meet this objective , because of the critical mass already here , our strengths in shipping finance and P &amp; amp ; I Club , the cluster of local shipowners , and maritime administration based on the UK model , and more so , an extremely business friendly environment and Government , not to mention Hong Kong 's position as the gateway to Mainland China , one of the largest maritime countries in the world with considerable potential for expansion . "

It is necessary to undertake , under the current structure , maximum democratization internally and moderate , cautious exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , to achieve the objective of peaceful evolution .  
Given the influence of the thinking that ' man and the heavens each reflect the other , ' Chinese astronomical observation could never escape superstition , " explains Hwang Yi-nung , associate professor of History at Tsing Hwa University .

A . Because the chairman of the Legislative Yuan has almost no power to decide , added to the fact that there have been a lot of protest incidents , it has been especially difficult these last two years to preside over the Yuan meetings .

Generally speaking , only to research each other is not enough . Of course , the reasons involved are very complicated . Speaking from my own limited knowledge of Western and Eastern culture , if there were one ideal state of affairs in this world , it would be a result of incorporating Western and Eastern cultural consciousness , extracting the essential kernels of each and doing away with the chaff . Perhaps that should be the objective of all mankind .  
This combination of Sun 's own words with journalistic evidence to provide both subjective and objective views was extremely well received .

"

Of course , people outside the CEPD are worried that all this might come to naught . The CEPD may work hard to coordinate among all agencies produce ideas to move Taiwan up in the rankings , but there might be no real improvement in competitiveness .

Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .

How to distinguish science from non-science is a basic but unresolved issue in the philosophy of science .

Chu Ching-i , a scholar at Academia Sinica , thinks that a child should not be forced to enter brutally competitive streaming before he has an understanding of his own subjective , natural disposition and objective , outside choices .

Then there is the objective political environment in which Taiwan exists , the cross-strait standoff .

Consequently , we are very concerned about the government 's current fiscal difficulties .  
We do n't want to violate the public spending law , but sometimes the objective economic circumstances are such that we ca n't help but do so . This law is not meant to be set in stone , but to act as a warning . We can not use strict adherence to the ceiling to resolve our fiscal problems .

Danger can be divided into two categories : perceived risk and objective risk . Wu Kuan-chang , exploration aficionado and a student in the doctoral program in Leisure Behavior at Indiana University 's Department of Recreation and Park Administration , points out that people 's anxieties about mountaineering and other adventure activities are primarily subjective perceptions of risk .

China believes that the improved safeguards system should be fair , objective , rational , transparent and feasible , and implemented strictly in accordance with the statute and relevant international agreements , on the basis of respect for the sovereignty of countries concerned , without jeopardizing their legitimate rights .  
Ukraine considers that one of the possible ways to obtain an objective analysis of and to solve the problems connected with the Chernobyl accident would be to set up an international technological research centre which would deal with issues related to the elimination of the consequences of nuclear radiological accidents and in whose work leading experts from various countries in the world could participate .  
To erect barriers in this regard is incompatible with the objective of establishing a new and more equitable international order for stable peace and for economic and social justice .  
These are some of the reasons that justify a rapprochement between Governments and the national olympic committees , and , moreover , that between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee , with the objective of achieving democratic societies made up of citizens who are active in their defence of close and lasting human relations .  
We therefore consider it vital to build a future premised on fundamental human rights , and for the realization of this objective we pursue an approach that recognizes the indivisibility of rights and that perceives no difference between civil and political rights , on the one hand , and cultural , social and economic rights , on the other .  
In this spirit , before I described some specific reform recommendations my delegation is advancing in connection with the current agenda item , it would be helpful to the Assembly 's consideration of these ideas for me to preface them with four essential points : the diagnostic framework ; the historical context ; and the premises and the paramount objective that underlie our proposals .  
This is an objective that is supported by the international community as a whole but , unfortunately , no progress has been made towards its achievement because Israel , who had insisted on direct negotiations with the countries concerned before such a zone could be established now refuses to enter into any negotiations on arms limitation in the nuclear field within the multilateral working group on arms limitation and regional security . 
The objective of these reforms is the removal of structural rigidities in order to correct the existing macroeconomic imbalances and lay the foundation for sustained economic growth .  
Together , we decided on priorities and goals , and the Social Summit formulated a consensus strategy that generated the political will indispensable to the promotion of the human dimension of development as a priority objective , in particular in order to overcome poverty , increase productive employment and bring about social integration .  
In pursuit of that objective we have contributed to the exchange of information and expertise in the various areas of development ; we have opened our markets to free international trade ; we have established the Abu Dhabi development fund to make concessional loans to developing countries ; and we have participated in the provision of assistance through regional and international bilateral and multilateral development institutions .  
We therefore consider it our obligation to reiterate once again that the ultimate solution to the problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices in various parts of the world is to achieve a complete ban on the production , stockpiling , exporting and proliferation of this type of inhumane weapon , and the future efforts of the international community must be directed towards this objective . 
This dual objective can not be achieved unless existing stockpiles of weapons-usable fissile material form an integral part of the negotiations , as reflected in the report of the Special Coordinator on this issue in the Conference on Disarmament and as indicated in the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee established within its framework .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In the light of the special characteristics of biological weapons and the complexity of verification , it is imperative to discuss and formulate necessary definitions and objective criteria , including lists of bacteriological ( biological ) agents and toxins , so as to clearly differentiate the prohibited activities from those allowed .  Only on this basis can there be a meaningful exploration of effective and practicable verification measures .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
The agenda item entitled Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons has been under consideration for several years in our Commission . For various reasons , the Commission has been unable to formulate a set of satisfactory guidelines for nuclear disarmament , thus falling short of people 's expectations . 
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled \ x { e4f8 } rocess of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons and \ x { e4fa } eview of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session . " 
Another constraint is the lack of sustained political commitment to , and support of , the process of enhanced productivity , economic growth and social equity in rural areas .  This is often caused by a lack of long-term national energy strategies with the objective of balanced national economic and social development .  
In considering the human rights situation in the region of the former Yugoslavia , it should be understood that the violations of those rights were the result of the political programme of the Belgrade authorities , who were pursuing their objective of territorial expansion or " Greater Serbia " through " ethnic cleansing " .  
The overall human settlement objective is to improve the social , economic and environmental quality of human settlements and the living and working environments of all people , in particular the urban and rural poor .  
The objective is to provide for the land requirements of human settlement development through environmentally sound physical planning and land use so as to ensure access to land to all households and , where appropriate , the encouragement of communally and collectively owned and managed land .  6 / Particular attention should be paid to the needs of women and indigenous people for economic and cultural reasons .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
In specific cases , the inclusion of special modules has been accompanied by the redesign of the basic questionnaire or at least parts of it , with the objective of continuing to adapt to changing conditions by incorporating improved techniques of research , and of perfecting the investigation of specific variables .  
In the light of overwhelming Croatian public support and the support of almost all of the parliamentary parties regarding the termination of the UNPROFOR mandate , the Sabor of the Republic of Croatia reiterates that negotiations , as well as the implementation of all basic provisions of United Nations Security Council resolutions , i.e . a peaceful reintegration of occupied territories , remain a permanent Croatian policy objective and orientation .  
Supporting academic and research institutions particularly in the developing countries , in their contribution to social development programmes , and to facilitate the mechanisms for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of social progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about economic and social development ;  
The primary objective of the country studies programme initiated by UNEP is to assist national Governments to identify , in the light of social , economic , environmental and other objectives , the basic needs and levels of effective conservation , including the rational use of national biological resources and the necessary supportive measures and costs to meet those needs , as well as the benefits associated with the implementation of those measures .  
His delegation was convinced that the duration of the Treaty and its subsequent extensions should be explicitly linked to progress in nuclear disarmament and , more specifically , to the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty as a short-term objective .  It felt that China 's proposal of 1996 as the year to achieve that goal was realistic and reasonable .  
It was noted that neither the principle of universal jurisdiction embodied in some national legislation nor the mechanism of international judicial cooperation was sufficient to achieve the said objective and that , while it was incumbent on Governments to bring such individuals to justice , the international community could complement and assist national efforts , in particular in situations where authorities were not in a position to maintain law and order .  
Thus , it was suggested that the creation of a single international criminal court would better serve the rule of law by offering fuller guarantees of the objective , impartial and uniform application of the future Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind than would ephemeral , ad hoc jurisdictions .  
One representative , while questioning the ability of the draft articles to provide adequate environmental protection for international watercourses , wondered in particular whether the emphasis on optimal utilization did not overshadow the objective of leaving a watercourse in a pristine state .  
In the fifth cycle , a substantial part of the indicative planning figures again went to this sector ( $ 4,790,000 ) ; in the mining sector , UNDP 's objective during the current cycle has been to help the Government mobilize other sources of finance and to attract potential investors with a view to exploiting mineral resources that have already been identified ( with geological maps , by drafting a mining code and publishing information brochures ) .

The UNEP corporate programme framework 1994-1995 stated that reliable flows of objective and meaningful information are critical to the mobilization of an environmentally aware and educated public and to the stimulation of effective decision-making .  
Thus , the United States made public its view that nuclear testing was important for the security of the Western alliance , which depended on the maintenance of a reliable nuclear deterrence and that , consequently , it could consider a comprehensive test-ban treaty only as a " long-term objective " whose realization must be sought in the context of radical nuclear arms reductions , expanded confidence-building measures and , particularly , improved verification capabilities .  
The latter 's objective is to enable people with low incomes in the Appalachian region successfully to enter the economic mainstream by , inter alia , organizing cooperative ventures among small firms to produce for niche markets , mobilizing financial resources on behalf of the region from outside , creating learning clusters in conjunction with other communities in the country , providing transitional support for people moving from welfare to work , and developing production and leadership skills .

The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
In the Final Declaration of the First Review Conference ( 1975 ) , 2 / which was adopted by consensus , the participants stated that the obligations undertaken under articles I and II of the Treaty had been faithfully observed by all parties , and that the continued strict observance of those articles remained central to the shared objective of averting the further proliferation of nuclear weapons .

The objective of the subprogramme is to support the mechanisms for operational coordination and inter-agency programming through IASC , other forums and the United Nations resident coordinators in the field in order to facilitate a coordinated and coherent response to major complex emergencies affecting large numbers of persons suffering from famine or displaced by civil strife or other disorders .  
In this context , the annual review by the Consultative Committee on Administrative Questions ( Financial and Budgetary Questions ) ( CCAQ ( FB ) ) of the functioning of the existing incentive and penalty schemes , designed to accelerate the payment of assessed contributions , confirmed previous conclusions that while penalty schemes remained generally effective , the usefulness of incentive schemes in obtaining the objective appeared doubtful .

State-of-the-art research papers for the Forum have been commissioned , and a long-term field research programme is being designed as a part of the present project .  
The objective of the subprogramme is to provide the General Assembly , the Economic and Social Council and other legislative bodies with systematic analysis and assessment of current global economic issues and trends and of their interrelations and implications for international and national action .

The World Summit for Social Development was remarkable in its scope : it gave a comprehensive meaning to social development , encompassing the functioning of society and all institutions for the overall objective of the betterment of the human condition and it placed people at the centre of all concerns and policies for sustainable development , proclaiming that all human beings are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with the environment .  
In the Mission 's view , the laying of mines in places where people work , live or circulate constitutes a violation of this commitment and of the principles of international humanitarian law , since it puts the civilian population at unnecessary risk and there is no proportionality between the intended military objective and the foreseeable harm that may be caused to that population . 
In order to attain such an objective , it is essential for all States to respect established rules governing relations among States , to comply with the principles and objectives of the United Nations , and therefore , to cease supporting terrorism , sowing terror throughout entire societies , resorting to sabotage , following extremist policies , betraying the true religion , and distorting thought .  
An international judicial commission of inquiry , however , could be viable and useful if its mandate gave it powers that would guarantee that its conclusions and recommendations would be put into effect and achieve the objective of prosecuting and punishing those responsible for the assassination of the President of Burundi on 21 October 1993 , for the massacres that followed and for other serious acts of violence and political crimes committed since October 1993 ;

Furthermore , these programme development activities , and the materials which result from them , provide an objective and publicly accessible record of the unbiased and universal content of the Centre 's assistance activities , which has the effect of increasing confidence in the programme while maximizing its utility and providing a means for its crucial and continuous improvement .  
Another institution with a direct bearing on the process of reconstruction and improving the living conditions of poor groups is the Social Investment Fund , which channels assistance to poor sectors of the population , including those uprooted by the conflict , thereby meeting the dual objective of combating poverty and strengthening the process of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
Consequently , the United States could not accept the Human Rights Committee 's views in its General Comment No . 24 ( 52 ) , since it did not believe that the classic rules on reservations were inadequate for human rights treaties .  On the contrary , they had helped to advance the fundamental objective of broad participation by States .  
Among the 15 requirements to achieve this objective is agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes ( ibid . , para . 88 ( c ) ) .

The Working Group is convinced that , without a long-term strategy benefiting from the effective contribution of all the players , first States and then the international organizations and non-governmental organizations concerned , it is difficult to envisage , even in the more or less distant future , the attainment of so ambitious an objective as universal enjoyment of the right to development .  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;

This interrelatedness of interests has formed a sort of common culture among nations and has created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideas and the tools of knowledge , thus enabling cultural and intellectual interaction among peoples of the world and enhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of world peace and security , an objective which the United Nations has sought to achieve over the past five decades .  
The fundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its previous efforts at building a viable democracy are being progressively addressed , taking into account the objective realities of our national situation , so as to ensure an orderly transition and the establishment of durable democratic structures of governance at all levels in our country .  
The United Nations was established 51 years ago with a focus on the maintenance of peace and security , and while that remains the objective , the linkage between peace and economic and social development , enshrined in the Charter , must be recognized and strengthened if the world is to escape the inexorable consequences of the continuously widening gap between rich and poor nations .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
At the conclusion of the series of high-level world Conferences organized under the auspices of the United Nations in the course of the 1990s , we noted that their common denominator was the promotion of economic and social justice , with the fundamental objective of approaching the structural causes of poverty in a concerted manner .

It is gratifying to see that the United Nations can be the international forum that enables the formulation and adoption , by the highest representatives of States , of such ambitious commitments as the commitment to eradicate absolute poverty by a target date to be set by each country , or the pursuit of the objective of full employment and the protection of social integration based on the enhancement and protection of human rights for all . .

Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
The ideal way of achieving this objective is not by applying arbitrary measures in the form of cutbacks , mass dismissals or redeployment , but by applying the guidelines of the General Assembly on personnel issues consistently , while observing and bolstering the principle that the Secretariat must be accountable in a strict and transparent fashion for the execution of the mandates entrusted to it by the Organization 's only universal organ that is , the General Assembly .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members .

It is further recognized that such improvement of the quality of emission data , in addition to improving the transparency and comparability of national emissions inventories , also improves knowledge of the relationship between global emissions and resulting atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases , and therefore aids significantly the task of estimating the emission limitations or reductions required to achieve a given concentration level of greenhouse gases , the ultimate objective of the Convention .  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;

Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
ARMITAGE ( Australia ) said that his country acknowledged the obligation of Member States , under Article 101 of the Charter , to ensure the conditions of service necessary to meet the objective of a highly competent , professional and independent international civil service .

The Preparatory Committee of the Habitat II Conference realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Furthermore , it was observed that the word was used in many international legal texts and that its objective and meaning were well understood : its purpose was to emphasize that public policy exceptions should be interpreted restrictively and that article 6 was only intended to be invoked under exceptional circumstances concerning matters of fundamental importance for the enacting State .  
She emphasized that UNEP must emerge as an independent , objective and authoritative organization , equipped and empowered to champion global environmental issues , lead the United Nations in a concerted attack on the worst aspects of global environmental degradation , and develop , monitor and perhaps even enforce international environmental law .

In retrospect , the victories of the people , first against the political sleight of hand to stop the elections , and then against the campaign of terror and intimidation to scare away the voters from the polling booths , seem to have left the reactionary forces in our country with only one remaining avenue to their objective , the unconstitutional overthrow of any civil Government , and that was precisely what happened on 25 May . The people of Sierra Leone have responded to the coup in a manner unique in the history of Africa .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .

As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
From the very start of the negotiations , the main objective of many non-nuclear-weapon States was to build into the architecture of the Treaty a renewed commitment by all States , and particularly the nuclear-weapon States , to a progressive and more systematic process leading to complete I repeat , complete nuclear disarmament .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
Australia 's primary goal for the Commission 's work on nuclear-weapon-free zones is an outcome in keeping with the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) decision on principles and objectives , that the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones , on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned , enhances regional and global peace and security and contributes to the ultimate objective of achieving a world entirely free of nuclear weapons .

In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .

The representative of the National Commission on Human Rights of Cameroon stated that at the regional level , other African national human rights institutions had entrusted Cameroon 's National Commission with the task of planning , preparing and hosting the first African Regional Conference of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights with the objective , among others , of encouraging States in the region to create their own national institutions ( see also paras .  25 _ 27 ) .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .  
Against this background it is imperative for all countries and the international community to reinstate the attainment of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies .

With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
The Seventh United Nations International Training Course on Remote Sensing Education for Educators , held at Stockholm and Kiruna , Sweden , from 5 May to 13 June 1997 , was organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Application in cooperation with the Government of Sweden . The course was conducted specifically for the benefit of educators from developing countries with the objective of enabling them to introduce remote sensing courses in their respective academic institutions .  
The role of private capital should be considered in a comprehensive and objective manner , bearing in mind that while it represented a positive aspect at the global level , many developing countries , especially African and least developed countries , had failed to benefit sufficiently from it .  
Its main objective would be to monitor the declared fissile material production facilities or those capable of such activity for the purposes of nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
It is , therefore , essential to ensure that the existing favourable conditions in international relations are utilized to achieve the ultimate objective of eliminating all nuclear weapons .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Emphasizing the need for accurate , objective and comprehensive information , as well as for a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual countries in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of women migrant workers for policy formulation and joint action ,  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
It focuses on the implementation of crucial activities that exemplify the Decade 's objective to reduce through concerted international action , especially in developing countries , the loss of life , property damage , and social and economic disruption caused by natural and similar disasters that have an adverse impact upon the environment .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide the poor populations in urban and rural areas , especially women , with the capabilities needed to increase their profit from participation in the market , thus improving their standards of living and raising their share of contribution to the gross domestic products of their countries .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip the Arab societies with greater capacity to reduce the lack of access to reliable sources of energy as a barrier to economic growth and human development , with a special focus on poor , remote areas and women , through the effective management of the supply and demand side of the issue .  
The objective in this thematic area is to provide Arab societies with additional capacity for pro-poor strategy , policy and programme development and implementation by increasing their ability to effectively formulate pro-poor policies and programmes and enhancing the performance of institutions ( public , private , civil society ) that deal with services for social development and especially for poverty eradication .  
The objective in this thematic area is to equip Arab societies with an increased capacity to devise and implement measures that can ensure food security at the family level , especially among poor populations , by helping to increase the inclusion of the issue of food security in state economic and social policies , to the extent that they regulate markets , investments and social safety nets , and to develop elements of a coherent system focused on making food available to all .  
The objective of programming in this area is to increase understanding of the socio-economic determinants of the HIV epidemic at a policy level , among Governments , and in the private sector and civil society , resulting in policies and programmes to promote an improved and effective response to the epidemic .  
The unique advantage of UNDP in this area derives from its extensive field presence in the region , its role as a trusted and objective provider of information and advice and coordinator of United Nations system programmes , its widespread contacts with governmental and non-governmental entities , and its growing body of technical expertise in country offices .  
As many here are aware , it is this objective which has led to Canada and others developing a comprehensive programme for Ottawa this December , when other practical measures will be further elaborated in such fields as demining , victim assistance and social and economic rehabilitation .  
The Rio Group stands convinced that these treaties will not only strengthen the international non-proliferation regime but will also promote the establishment of other nuclear-weapon-free zones in other parts of the world , which will lead to the gradual expansion of nuclear-weapon-free zones until the ultimate objective of all the States Members of the Organization has been attained a world that is entirely free of nuclear weapons . 
It is our view that we should seek every opportunity in every forum to address the issue of landmines , in the hope that by our concerted and combined efforts we will realize the ultimate humanitarian objective we all share : to bring an end to the dreadful suffering those mines wreak on their innocent victims .  
In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
The main objective of the Symposium was to provide an opportunity for representatives of space industry and the private sector to interact with international space scientists , space technology experts and policy makers from developing and developed countries and to explore possibilities for increased scientific and technical cooperation .  
Paragraph 1 ( a ) of the note describes the qualities of the person to assume that position , which include high moral standing and personal integrity ; expertise , including in the field of human rights ; and the general knowledge and understanding of diverse cultures necessary for impartial , objective , non-selective and effective performance of the duties of the High Commissioner .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , Alvaro Ramos , said earlier in the fifty-first session of the General Assembly , the international community must continue to encourage direct dialogue between Israel , the Palestinian Authority and the Arab countries in order to support mutual recognition and faithfulness to the ultimate objective of a firm and lasting peace in the Middle East .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
Special emphasis is being put on and we have started work towards the reorganization of the army , with the objective of gradually having a smaller , more efficient and professional force under strict civilian control , in conformity with all standards of modern armies , capable of performing its functions properly and of being a genuine partner in partnership activities .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .  
In the debate at this session on proposals for reforming the United Nations , I would like , at the outset , to state that the strategic objective of all of the reforms envisaged must be to provide better conditions for the proper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil its founders ' dream of a lasting , democratic , responsible and credible Organization .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .  
Through the three-pronged approach adopted by the Summit , States committed themselves to pursuing the objective of eradicating poverty in the world , promoting full employment as a fundamental public-policy priority and promoting social integration by fostering stable , safe and just societies on the basis of respect for human rights , non-discrimination and the closest possible involvement of all in decisions affecting their well-being .  
While it is true that responsibility for social development lies , first and foremost , with States themselves , which have the right and duty to implement appropriate policies to achieve that objective , it is no less true that this responsibility must be assumed , in a spirit of solidarity , by the international community as a whole , not just because of moral and political requirements that are broadly shared today , but also because of the enlightened self-interest of us all .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
We therefore support the set of constructive and objective proposals put forward by the members of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , which take cognizance of the realities of change , the results of the political developments witnessed by today \ x { e5b8 } world and the legitimate concerns of the developing countries in keeping with the concepts of the Charter and of the rules of international law .  
This draft resolution accepts my proposal to establish a development dividend funded by administrative savings , thereby reaffirming our collective commitment to the instrumental objective of efficiency as well as the substantive priority of economic and social development .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
Past endeavours have also shown that the primary objective of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones is to seek the absence of nuclear weapons from various parts of the world ; to insulate the zonal States from the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons ; to prevent horizontal as well as vertical proliferation of nuclear weapons , which could pose new and unacceptable threats to the security of States ; to contribute to the process of disarmament , especially nuclear disarmament ; and to facilitate cooperation in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Recommends also that the Conference on Disarmament should actively continue intensive negotiations with a view to reaching early agreement and concluding effective international arrangements to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons , taking into account the widespread support for the conclusion of an international convention and giving consideration to any other proposals designed to secure the same objective ;  
Calls upon all States , in particular those with major space capabilities , to contribute actively to the objective of the peaceful use of outer space and of the prevention of an arms race in outer space and to refrain from actions contrary to that objective and to the relevant existing treaties in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation ;  
To this end , by agreement between the two Governments , governmental and academic experts from both countries have begun to formulate a binational study on migration , the central purpose of which is to provide an objective , comprehensive and long _ term analysis of migration to be used in designing and enforcing more effective policies that address the real causes and effects of migration .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 48 / 163 of 21 December 1993 in which it proclaimed the International Decade of the World 's Indigenous People ( 1995-2004 ) , stated that the Decade 's main objective was to strengthen international cooperation for the solution of problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health .  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The international community as a whole has taken a stand on this subject , in a virtually consensual manner , in endorsing the objective of a total ban on anti _ personnel mines by a very large majority with no negative votes in United Nations General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 L . As you know , France supported that text . 
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
Underlines the need for Governments , with international cooperation , to increase and implement alternative development programmes with the objective of reducing and eliminating the production of illicit drugs , taking into account the economic , social , cultural , political and environmental aspects of the area concerned ;  
Contents of reports , notes and confidential letters should be easy to understand ; be free of vagueness or ambiguity ; include only information which is supported by competent , valid and relevant evidence ; take into account new publishing technologies ; and be independent , objective , fair , constructive , short and concrete .  
Agenda 21 has proved to be the starting point for many new business initiatives with sustainability as their stated objective , with notable progress in the areas of joint industry / government partnerships and the development of innovative policy instruments , environmentally efficient technologies and products , and broader sustainability concerns regarding the relation of business and the wider community .  
Whereas : Through the Platt Amendment and its continued intervention and meddling in the internal affairs of the country , the United States of America usurped part of the national territory by installing the Guant \ x { 5ad5 } amo naval base , imposed corrupt and despotic regimes , including the ignominious and bloody tyrannies of Machado and Batista , and since 1959 has systematically attacked Cuba with the declared objective of putting an end to its independence , eliminating Cuban nationality and forcing the population into servitude ,  
Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General regarding the review of major publications of the Department of Public Information , [ 4 ] and urges all efforts to ensure timely production and dissemination of its major publications , in particular the UN Chronicle , the Yearbook of the United Nations , the World Media Handbook and Africa Recovery , maintaining consistent editorial independence and accuracy , taking the necessary measures to ensure that they contain adequate , objective and equitable information about issues before the Organization and reflecting divergent opinions wherever they occur ;  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
In strategic objective F . 5 , the Platform for Action calls for the elimination of occupational segregation by promoting the equal participation of women in highly skilled jobs and senior management positions , and through other measures that stimulate women 's on-the-job career development and upward mobility in the labour market , and by stimulating the diversification of occupational choices by both women and men ; women should be encouraged to take up non-traditional jobs ; and men should be encouraged to seek employment in the social sector ( para . 178 ( g ) ) .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations . 
In other words , the principle of holding States accountable for non-compliance with their treaty obligations by means of an objective and constructive dialogue , on the basis of comprehensive information and inputs from all interested parties , has been vindicated in practice and has the potential to be an important and effective means by which to promote respect for human rights .  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
The overall objective of the programme emergency humanitarian assistance , derived from these General Assembly resolutions , is " to ensure better preparation for , as well as a rapid and coherent response to , emergencies , natural and man-made , thus reducing the suffering and loss of human lives and material destruction ; promoting prevention and preparedness ; and ensuring smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation and development " . b  
The main objective of the Institute is to fulfil the training needs of developing countries in the area of ageing and to act as a practical bridge between developed and developing countries in promoting technical cooperation , exchanging skills and knowledge and providing advisory services .  
Reiterates that the main objective of the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty is to achieve the goal of eradicating absolute poverty and reducing overall poverty substantially in the world through decisive national actions and international cooperation in implementing fully and effectively the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments agreed upon at the United Nations major conferences and summits organized since 1990 as they relate to poverty eradication ;

In this connection , it is worth noting that during the fifteenth session of the Commission on Human Settlements , some delegations expressed their concern over the tendency of the Centre to spread its resources on activities that were largely tangential to its mandate and expressed the hope that the programme of work would remain focused on human settlements development as its prime objective .  
The objective of the Task Force on an Enabling Environment for Economic and Social Development is to establish a synthesis of best practices or lessons learned in order to clarify the elements of an enabling environment for economic and social development , establish mechanisms for improving inter-agency coordination in support of such an environment , and provide respective constituents with standardized inter-agency performance indicators of social and economic progress that represent the development agenda reflected in the outcome of the major conferences .  
The objective of the case studies was to examine the role of the United Nations system agencies in assisting countries to create an appropriate macroeconomic and social framework , which would entail exploring instances where the successful development of an enabling environment had been enhanced through United Nations system agency support and inter-agency coordination , or where the lack of such coordination proved to be detrimental . 
With regard to the section on relief and rehabilitation , one delegation expressed the view that humanitarian relief operations should not be wound up or scaled down prematurely as that had negative implications for the rehabilitation process that followed and that exit strategies for the Department of Humanitarian Affairs should be comprehensive , neutral and objective and should not be dictated by political considerations .  
Although the distributional impact of harmonized national carbon taxes may be uneven , it could be complemented by allocating the revenue to a trust fund to be used to finance projects for those countries which are overburdened with carbon taxes . 29 The rates should be chosen to meet the carbon emission abatement objective and should be periodically adjusted as more is learned about global warming .  
The main objective of the round table , following-up on the interregional round table held in Toronto , Canada , in September 1996 , was to monitor the manner in which ethical medical directives protected human rights .

The Working Group considered that the main objective of the study is to identify the constituent elements and effects of unilateral legal acts of States and to set forth rules which are generally applicable to them , as well as any special rules that might be relevant for particular types or categories of such acts .  
Reaffirms that the objective of capacity-building and its sustainability should continue to be an essential part of the operational activities of the United Nations system at the country level and should be country-driven and situation specific , and should be based on the programme approach , to the extent possible , consistent with national development plans and priorities ;  
The programme translated the goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from a rhetorical objective into actual reality , setting forth requirements in terms of active efforts to identify specific measures for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a well-defined time-frame and under effective international control pending the achievement of the desired goals through negotiation .  
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .  
The expert groups established by the committee had drawn up a national strategy and a triennial plan of action with the objective of guaranteeing the equality of women before the law , the participation of women in all political institutions , an increase in the participation of women in economic activities , the advancement of rural women and support for women in the territories occupied by Israel .  
It also firmly supported the work of the International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) as the independent international authority responsible for the objective and balanced evaluation of the efforts of States to establish a global narcotics control policy and genuine international cooperation in that area .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
The objective , among others , is to provide suggestions on how to adjust the existing policies and procedures to make them more responsive to the current needs of agencies in providing better guidance and controlling their activities carried out by their implementing partners , hence making the overall humanitarian assistance programmes more effective and transparent .

In the face of the intransigent position of the military junta , which has refused to step down , bringing about further deterioration of the situation in the country , which has one of the world 's lowest living standards , and threatening regional peace and security , the Polish delegation believes that the measures recommended by ECOWAS , which the Security Council would take by adopting the present draft resolution , are appropriate for the objective of the expeditious restoration of the democratically elected Government of Sierra Leone .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
The Meeting of the Parties shall periodically review the adequacy of the commitments of the Parties included in Annex I or acting under Article 10 , in the light of the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts , as well as relevant technical , social and economic information , with a view to achieving the objective of the Convention .  
The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , adopted on 15 September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women , held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995 , refers to coercive economic measures in a section on strategic objectives and actions concerning women and armed conflict . 11 Under strategic objective E . 3 , paragraph 145 contains , inter alia , the following provisions regarding actions to be taken by Governments and international and regional organizations : 
When economic measures are employed for coercive purposes , instrumental economic effects are obviously their primary objective , which is achieved by restricting the target State 's access to markets , capital , technology and communications .

Established in June 1987 at Dublin , Ireland , under the initial name of the World LPG Forum , with the objective to promote worldwide the use of liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) as a safe , convenient , clean and efficient fuel . 
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
Its objective is twofold : ( a ) to assess how to enhance national capacities to manage private capital , both domestic and foreign , in least developed countries and ( b ) to search for feasible ways and means of facilitating private investment in support of SHD .  
However , wider use of digital signatures requires adaptation in national legal frameworks so as to enable such technologies to achieve the intended objective of providing a truly reliable and trustworthy electronic environment .  
In this respect nuclear disarmament remains an inescapable objective , as the international community decided 20 years ago , one which is itself an integral component of general and complete disarmament .  
A new multimedia central editorial board will be established , with the objective of developing and maintaining a timely and more effective news gathering and delivery capacity , tied as much as possible to the global daily news cycle .  
As a first step towards that objective , measures should be pursued that would enhance the transparency in surplus fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices in parallel with a fissile material cut-off treaty .  
The basic objective of the national population programme for the period 1995-2000 was to raise living standards and the quality of life of all Mexicans , and to bring demographic trends into line with the country 's potential for economic development .

Even though the prime objective of the 1993 SNA is clearly to enable countries to compile their specific economic data set , an important secondary objective is to improve the international database on national accounts .  
The 1990s will be remembered for the international conferences and world summits that have developed a broad consensus on global social , economic and environmental issues with the over-arching objective of eradicating poverty .

One law worthy of note is the Environmental Protection Act of 10 December 1996 , one main objective of which is to defend the human right in environmental matters that is laid down in the Constitution : the right to live in a healthy environment ( article 37.3 ) .  
For that reason , my delegation believes that we must reflect the cultural , social and religious diversity of all countries as we strive to attain realistic and objective social development , without imposing a single model on everyone . 
It is valid only until nuclear disarmament is achieved , and resolute , systematic and progressive efforts towards the final objective of eliminating nuclear weapons worldwide are of crucial importance to it .

The General Assembly thus established both a clearly structured functional platform and institutional base , as well as a 10-year programme of action , guided by the overall objective as mentioned above , and built around the following main goals :  
This encouragement demonstrated a conscious political will that recognizes the importance of women in this field in particular , based on sound principles whereby equality between men and women is the means and approach adopted and whereby the advancement of women is an eminent objective to be accomplished with the aim of achieving a free and equal society , as is the motivation of women to assume higher political office .

The interviews with political , military and police authorities , public officials , accused persons , witnesses and victims of the attacks , and members of the public chosen at random in Havana , formed a body of first-hand material as a basis for as thorough and objective an investigation as possible into the subject assigned to the Special Rapporteur .  
Of course , we know full well that in order for that objective to be attained , the support of the international community is crucial , not only at the political level , where its backing will be needed for the implementation of our decisions and resolutions , but also at the equally important level of logistics and material support , technical assistance and humanitarian considerations . 
I have been struck by the deep historical resonances of this process , for when the United Nations was established at the end of the Second World War , part of its rationale as an organization was to have been the impartial and objective resolution of international problems , free of the old cycles of retribution through resort to aggression .  
A strong and efficient United Nations will allow us to attain the main objective of this initiative : to determine agreed parameters for creating a stable and prosperous world without violence and without war , on the basis of the principles of inter-State relations contained in the Charter , and to find collective responses to the most complicated global challenges .
