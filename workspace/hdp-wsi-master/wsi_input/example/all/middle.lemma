"  
Chang Hao has a penetrating analysis in that regard . Modernization theories , he points out , have their origin in the 18th-century Enlightenment . Their argument is simple : " modernization " - - meaning industrialization , capitalism , the rise of a middle class , democracy and freedom of thought - - is good and the sole criterion of value used to measure a country 's " progress . " And evidenced by the " backward " countries of the " non-Western world , " modernization and tradition are often antithetical .

Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !

In the era when " cutting trees for foreign exchange " was the principal aim of the Republic of China 's forest policy , the Yuli District Forest Office preserved a stand of 60 stout camphor trees by the middle stretches of the Chingshui River . As the only remaining virgin tract of stout camphors , which are broad-leafed trees native to Taiwan , the stand has today become an essential resource in an effort to return Chingshui River to its original ecology .  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa .

Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
The problem of creativity in Taiwan films lies in the fact that the proletarian class is attached to Hong Kong and Hollywood films that are sensory stimulation , while elite culture is still separated by too large a gap .

An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss .

" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts .

My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time .

The improved social position means that they no longer have to write to please authority to ensure their livelihood .

What is more important is doing their specialized job and allowing the free competition of the market to decide their success or failure .

It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich . But this class arose in such a short time period here that it does n't have a well-formed culture of its own , and therefore consumption , which demonstrates that wealth has been acquired , has become its most glaring trademark .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors .

As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students .

With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .

All these lead us to feel that there is a need to empower women , " Ms Kao continued .

In track and field events , middle school students won 42 of the total 102 medals , or some 40 percent , while there were also many junior middle and elementary school students defeating national representatives in the table tennis competition .  
But perhaps one of Ta An 's greatest attractions is a throwback to its earlier history - - the trees and grass that adorn its broader boulevards such as the elegant Jenai Road . Here , the dense foliage , chirping birds and silver spray of fountains can easily make one forget one is in the middle of a bustling commercial district .  
The usual shape of a seal is oblong , but some seals are unusual in form . The most important variant shapes are introduced below : Stringed seal .

The scope of advanced classes is broader , and students may choose materials that are appropriate to their level of proficiency and that are related to their research and interests .  
Generally , after the rise of a middle class , a society 's expectations of its government are raised , so that the public of an advanced democratic nation is often evenly divided in its satisfaction with government performance , and a seventy or eighty percent satisfaction rate like some of ours is no longer easily attained .

However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
Chang Hao has a penetrating analysis in that regard . Modernization theories , he points out , have their origin in the 18th-century Enlightenment . Their argument is simple : " modernization " - - meaning industrialization , capitalism , the rise of a middle class , democracy and freedom of thought - - is good and the sole criterion of value used to measure a country 's " progress . " And evidenced by the " backward " countries of the " non-Western world , " modernization and tradition are often antithetical .

Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !

Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
The problem of creativity in Taiwan films lies in the fact that the proletarian class is attached to Hong Kong and Hollywood films that are sensory stimulation , while elite culture is still separated by too large a gap . We have lost middle-of-the-road commercial entertainment , " argues Chiao . Ang Lee proves the potential of the middle road .  
Because people have greater contact with the outside world and easy access to information and because everyone , particularly the middle class , is paying increasing attention to quality of life , when people see that consumer goods in Taiwan are of low quality and high price , they seek happier shopping grounds abroad .

Drinks prepared at bubble tea shops start with simple red or green tea .

"  
Chen Kuan-cheng explains that the typical European and American social security system is an intergenerational transfer of benefits , which is to say that the living expenses of the current elderly are paid by the current young and middle aged . When the current young become the seniors , the next generation will pay the bills .  
From the international perspective , the global economy has been dragging along at a low ebb for some years now . There have been many reports of layoffs , salary cuts , and plant closings , even for established multinational giants .

It 's a place of dramatic cliffs and gigantic boulders , where white sand beaches meet grasslands . But more than this , its special geographic location puts it in the middle of the Kuroshio current , which runs from the equator and nurtures coral and tropical fish , making for a beautiful and colorful underwater world .  
The other teachers are all waiting for us to make fools of ourselves . They say we have absolutely no chance of success . " April Ten Alliance convener Chang Tze-chou has lent a hand solving the problem of " experimental class students being too noisy and getting out of control during class , " in response to the invitation of a teacher at a middle school experimenting with new policies .

A new seaborne celebrity : teaFrom the astonishing beauty of 16th-century blue-and-white ware to the strange and gaudy ware of the 18th century ; from the curio cabinets of kings and nobles to the luxury dinner services of the middle classes , Chinese export porcelain captivated Europe for several centuries . Did the Europeans really never think about " technology transfer , " instead sticking respectfully to the ideal of a global village with a " global division of labor " ?  
An incoming middle school teacher earned about NT $ 4000 per month ( or less than US $ 100 at then-current exchange rates ) . It was a time of political and diplomatic crises . President Chiang Kai-shek had died less than a year before ( in April , 1975 ) , and citizens accustomed to following a strong leader were at a loss . With little international room to maneuver following the ROC 's withdrawal from the United Nations , Taiwan 's only asset was economic growth .  
Later on , the Puli Township public works bureau took the initiative to recruit scholars and relevant administrative agencies , holding the Puli High School Tamalin Ruins Investigative Conference , at which they decided a full-scale excavation ought to take place at the original test dig site .

" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
They had a low level of culture and knowledge , thinking only to gain the maximum they could in the minimum amount of time . In his book 100 Years Ago , the author John Warner writes that they were ' conservative , vulgar , lacking creative abilities in literature , science , or art .

Taiwan 's conception of personal finance has changed a lot . Chang Shui-chiang , editor-in-chief of the Commercial Times , said when he was a guest on the program that during the " golden age " of the last decade , the middle class has risen , government restrictions have been relaxed , and there have been ample business opportunities . A conception of personal finance has become one of the foundations of economic life .

Today journalists are part of the salaried middle class , well trained , with stable lives . The improved social position means that they no longer have to write to please authority to ensure their livelihood . They also do n't need to unrealistically regard all the troubles of the world as their responsibility . What is more important is doing their specialized job and allowing the free competition of the market to decide their success or failure .  
When we come to the Mennonite Christian Hospital in early December , a huge Christmas tree stands in the middle of the foyer of the newly completed hospital building . At the registration counter , in the consulting rooms , at the payment counter , at the pharmacy and even in the staff offices , everywhere is festooned with colored streamers , snowflakes and fairy lights . Instead of the cold , depressing atmosphere usually associated with hospitals , the place is full of the warm and festive spirit of Christmas .

" The majority of Taiwanese senior citizens in the US come here to live with their grown children , who mostly have master 's or PhD degrees , and are ' suburban Chinese . ' Because the homes of their children are spread out in middle - and high-class residential areas , unlike members of self-contained urban Chinatowns , elderly Taiwanese suffer great inconvenience if they are unable to communicate in English , " says Peter C . Lee , associate vice-president of the Office of Faculty Affairs at San Jose State University in California .  
They helped Chang retrace his first heartthrob , who he has never forgotten , and also his middle school military instructor , who devoted great efforts to guiding him .

Currently sex education classes-covering things like reproductive biology , sexual values , and the use of sanitary napkins and condoms-are being taught in middle and primary schools across Taiwan . Through education at the roots , children can be helped to keep themselves steady through this period of vast change , and build a sexual value system suited to the 21st century .  
" Today 's exam system produces people who only know how to pass exams . The ones who are no good at exams go into the dummies ' class , and those who fail are filled with a sense of inferiority ; by that time , it 's too late to save them . " Under soft yellow lamplight in a simple but elegant teahouse , a circle of listeners attentively watch the speaker in the middle .  
The initial enthusiastic response was overshadowed by the 1979 Formosa Incident in Kaohsiung , but as Taiwan 's rapid economic development in the 1980s swelled the ranks of the middle classes , all kinds of political and non-political social movements gathered strength , and organizations such as Chai Sung-lin 's Consumers ' Foundation and Li Yuan-chen 's Awakening Foundation came into being .  
In Chung 's paintings of broken down old homes , one also sees the different materials used in the three levels of the walls : the lowest section is made of stone ; the middle section is constructed out of brick or faced with earthenware tiles ; and the topmost section is built from mud bricks covered in plaster .  
It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich . But this class arose in such a short time period here that it does n't have a well-formed culture of its own , and therefore consumption , which demonstrates that wealth has been acquired , has become its most glaring trademark .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors . Recently , the former president of the Control Yuan , Wang Tso-yung , publicly labeled the Taiwan stockmarket a " cannibal market . " The challenges of a financial economy have clearly only just begun to emerge , and economic policy will probably now confront more difficulties and resistance than ever .  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
Wu Hui-mei , a teacher at Chengcheng Junior High also sees many shortcomings in multiple-track admissions . She says the top schools are very competitive and hard to get into , whereas vocational senior high schools are easy to get into and often short of students . The result is that the schools in the middle end up getting overloaded .  
While the star school phenomenon is not something that can be changed overnight , the pecking order among middle rank schools is already growing blurred . If high schools work together to raise the quality of education , perhaps the star school syndrome will just fade away on its own .  
For instance , nowadays when one sees a Chinese-style roof with upswept eaves , the red beam high up in the middle is actually made from a tube of compressed paper . The light , cheap paper tube is wrapped in a layer of gauze and covered in red paint . Unless you actually tapped it , you would n't know it was paper .  
In the 1980s , a number of young directors joined Taiwan 's film community . They made a bold break with tradition and gave rise to a new wave in local film . After a harsh winnowing , only Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang remained , the former noted for his excellent grasp of Taiwanese imagery and the latter for his clinical depiction of the urban middle class .  
The dead tree is the most visually striking object in the valley .

In Zhou Chen 's Ning Qi Feeding an Ox , the brushwork of the trees and rocks is fluid and uninhibited , employing vigorous lines similar to those used in the work of Tang Yin , Qiu Ying , and even their predecessor Du Jin . The techniques in which these painters were so adept fused the artistic heritage of earlier generations , from the Tang dynasty onwards , creating a distinctive style that captured the mood of the middle Ming period .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences .

In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
If you come into the downtown area , the National Policy Foundation and the Taiwan Research Institute , set in the middle of the concrete jungle , would , on the other hand , be more reminiscent of the Heritage Foundation or the Brookings Institution in Washington , with large numbers of retired government officials , and therefore tight security , in their modern office buildings .  
The crested serpent eagle 's whole body is covered in gray and brown feathers , but striking bands of white run across the wings and the middle of the tail feathers of the adult birds , making them easy to identify from the ground when they circle in the skies .  
Liu was originally trained as an electrical engineer , and in fact served as such for the greater part of his life . He took up the brush during middle age and went on to develop a highly personal style . Later in life , Liu crossed the border into the field of anthropology , making bold expeditions to Africa , Borneo , Latin America , and Oceania . He bounced back and forth between myriad pursuits , and was able to achieve impressive results in each field .  
In the sixth lunar month , traditional music and theater troupes from across Taiwan make their festive way through an outdoor market in Lukang with " birthday noodles " and " birthday peaches , " screeching away on their high-pitched suona ( a traditional Chinese wind instrument ) and beating on gongs and drums as they head toward Yuchu Temple , located in the middle of an old outdoor market . They come here to pay their respects to Marshal Tiandu , honored by many thespians in Taiwan as their patron god .  
Unlike the literati of the Southern and Northern dynasty ( 420-589 ) who emphasized classical allusions and symmetrical verses , Han Yu left the world of the classics and instead chose the middle and lower classes as his point of departure . He wrote about mundane things in artistic , truly beautiful writing , and yet managed to indirectly express grander thinking about the governance of the nation .
