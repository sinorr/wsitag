In reply to the accusations concerning the right to food and adequate health care , his delegation stressed once again that the system for rationing basic products introduced in 1990 because of the economic sanctions imposed against Iraq applied to all Iraqi citizens without exception or discrimination , which the United Nations missions that had travelled to Iraq and several reports by international organizations could confirm .

The Court of Appeal further stressed that the contract had been concluded between a seller with its place of business in France and a buyer resident in Portugal , that France was a State Party to CISG whereas Portugal had neither signed nor ratified it , and that it was therefore necessary to ascertain whether CISG was applicable through the provisions of private international law ( art . 1 ( 1 ) ( b ) ) .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .

It was stressed that the very high real interest rates in transitional economies such as Kazakstan were characteristic of a transitional period of macro adjustment and reflected high levels of uncertainty and perceived risks to lenders ; such rates did not represent equilibrium conditions and far exceeded the possibilities for most enterprises to generate sufficient real income .

While the greatest importance is often attached to imports of capital goods , it should be stressed that imports of manufactured intermediates also play a major role in the modernization of production structures , upgrading the quality of output , and generating positive spillovers to the rest of the economy . 3 The import structure of the eastern European transition economies thus appears to be consistent with efforts to restructure their economies . 
The Presidents stressed the need for unconditional respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the preservation and development , in accordance with universally recognized norms , of the ethnic , linguistic , cultural and religious diversity of all peoples living in the Russian Federation and Ukraine .

One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .

In this connection , the expert group stressed the importance of the progressive development and codification of relevant norms of international law ( e.g . the law of State responsibility , including countermeasures in response to international wrongful acts or prior injury ) as well as specific enforcement provisions or mechanisms incorporated in international regimes , which provide a universally accepted basis for judging the legitimacy of the use of economic coercion under certain circumstances ( see sect .  B below ) .

The most important of these observations and recommendations stressed that a true saving from the introduction of efficiency measures is achieved if costs are reduced while the level and quality of service is maintained or further improved .  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .

As stressed by the Harare expert group , integrated water resource management is therefore essential for integrating and reconciling interests in the river basin whether national or international with regard to water quality , quantity and the aquatic ecosystems .  
More direct controls , such as those employed in Chile , would help to contain the disruptive effects of surges in short-term capital flows on economic growth , which if successful would actually make the environment more attractive for longer-term direct investment . 37 It should also be stressed that most transition economies possess extremely small financial sectors in relation to global capital flows , most of which come from the more advanced market economies . 
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .

The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
The recent United Nations global conferences have stressed that strong public institutions , efficient public administration systems and a competent civil service are essential for the development efforts of developing countries and countries with economies in transition .

Still , it should be stressed that while mutual participation and representation at each others meetings and projects is an important means for exchanging information about programmes and activities and should therefore be strongly encouraged , it does not provide , by itself , an adequate foundation for making the work of the Councils subsidiary machinery more harmonious , complementary and coherent in responding to mandates , in particular those emanating from major conferences .  
It should be stressed , however , that the most efficient and effective way for a functional commission that wishes quite legitimately to contribute its own particular perspective on a multidimensional issue is to build its input on the basis of relevant analyses and policy recommendations provided by other functional commissions and other United Nations bodies , in particular those which have primary responsibility for addressing the underlying major issue , and in close consultation with them .  
The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .

Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .

That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice .

As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .

In its resolution 51 / 202 , the Assembly stressed the importance of encouraging national initiatives for social development , including , inter alia , credit for people living in poverty , particularly women , along the model of the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in connection with self-employment and income generation to address the feminization of poverty , and noted with interest the micro credit summit to be held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 .  
One Government stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that , if consensus proved difficult to achieve at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions . 
The majority of Governments favouring the convening of a conference stressed the importance of having a discussion of a technical and analytical nature that would present a fair and objective assessment of the causes and consequences of international migration , of the major flows of international migrants , and of the positive and negative aspects of international migration in relation to development for both countries of origin and countries of destination .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
He had stressed that , despite their small size and limited resources , the Territories were entitled to exercise their rights to self-determination and independence , and he had reiterated the Special Committee 's conviction that accelerated economic and social development would contribute to the swift implementation of the General Assembly resolution in those Territories .  
In this connection , the expert group stressed the importance of the progressive development and codification of relevant norms of international law ( e.g . the law of State responsibility , including countermeasures in response to international wrongful acts or prior injury ) as well as specific enforcement provisions or mechanisms incorporated in international regimes , which provide a universally accepted basis for judging the legitimacy of the use of economic coercion under certain circumstances ( see sect .  B below ) .  
The importance of international cooperation , including multilateral and bilateral negotiations on contentious issues , and of positive economic measures that involve adequate incentives and reward systems to induce policy changes , when warranted , was reaffirmed and stressed at the meeting as a more rational and viable alternative to unilateral coercive economic measures in most cases .

The most important of these observations and recommendations stressed that a true saving from the introduction of efficiency measures is achieved if costs are reduced while the level and quality of service is maintained or further improved .  
The international community should take steps to alleviate that problem , and in that respect attention should be drawn to the constructive proposals appearing in General Assembly resolution 52 / 185 , which stressed the need to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
The European Union stressed the need to prohibit female genital mutilation , and supported the practical steps taken by Governments , intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , community organizations and religious institutions to eliminate such practices through , inter alia , efforts to change societal attitudes by raising awareness of the harmful effects of such practices .  
As stressed by the Harare expert group , integrated water resource management is therefore essential for integrating and reconciling interests in the river basin whether national or international with regard to water quality , quantity and the aquatic ecosystems .  
More direct controls , such as those employed in Chile , would help to contain the disruptive effects of surges in short-term capital flows on economic growth , which if successful would actually make the environment more attractive for longer-term direct investment . 37 It should also be stressed that most transition economies possess extremely small financial sectors in relation to global capital flows , most of which come from the more advanced market economies . 
The Note stressed that while the challenge of closing the gap between theory and practice required concerted action from all concerned parties , including States , the United Nations and other international , regional and non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and community groups , the success of this effort will ultimately depend on the political will of States .

The need for greater understanding of the genesis of conflicts was stressed , and while it was recognized that unique circumstances might differentiate conflicts , certain causes dearth of visionary leadership ; absence of good governance , especially transparency and accountability ; neglect of human rights ; pervasive poverty ; inequitable distribution of wealth and resources ; and social and cultural exclusion which breeds ethnic clashes are common to all .  
The recent United Nations global conferences have stressed that strong public institutions , efficient public administration systems and a competent civil service are essential for the development efforts of developing countries and countries with economies in transition .

Requests the Special Unit to ensure the effective implementation of the new directions strategy in Africa , bearing in mind the priority areas identified by African countries themselves in the Cairo Agenda for Action , as well as the Tokyo Agenda for Action , which stressed , among other things , the principles of accelerated economic growth for poverty reduction and further integration of the continent into the global economy in addition to the concepts of ownership and global partnership ;

They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
The Ministers stressed the critical role of capital markets in raising the level of domestic savings , attracting foreign private investment , and stemming and reversing capital flight .  
In addition , these contradictions place a formidable burden on the formulation and realization of future negotiated legal instruments between indigenous peoples and States : the difficulties of negotiating those new instruments without having previously identified and settled key questions need not be stressed .  
In a statement it released on this topic , ACC stressed that poverty eradication a main underlying theme of recent global conferences is a key international commitment and a central objective of the United Nations system .  
It was stressed , however , that prior to undertaking peacekeeping missions , every effort should be made to seek the early resolution of conflicts through pacific settlement of disputes by the parties concerned through negotiation , inquiry , mediation , conciliation , arbitration , judicial settlement , resort to regional agencies or arrangements , or other peaceful means in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations .  
Still , it should be stressed that while mutual participation and representation at each others meetings and projects is an important means for exchanging information about programmes and activities and should therefore be strongly encouraged , it does not provide , by itself , an adequate foundation for making the work of the Councils subsidiary machinery more harmonious , complementary and coherent in responding to mandates , in particular those emanating from major conferences .  
It should be stressed , however , that the most efficient and effective way for a functional commission that wishes quite legitimately to contribute its own particular perspective on a multidimensional issue is to build its input on the basis of relevant analyses and policy recommendations provided by other functional commissions and other United Nations bodies , in particular those which have primary responsibility for addressing the underlying major issue , and in close consultation with them .  
The Special Rapporteur stressed that in order for a legal act to be valid under international law , it must be attributable to a State , the representative of that State must have the capacity to engage it at the international level , the act must be the expression of its will and free of irregularities and it must be formulated in the proper manner .

Recognizing that the world was stepping into the twenty-first century with the burden of many unresolved conflicts and stalemated peace processes , the meeting stressed that those conflicts posed a threat to peace and drained the scarce resources of the world , which were urgently required for the development and prosperity of the human race .  
The United Nations and LAS stressed the multidimensional nature of the landmines problem with its humanitarian , economic , political and environmental ramifications , which posed major obstacles to the development of mine-infested countries , not to mention the devastating loss of thousands of lives .

Independent national human rights institutions , acting in accordance with the 1991 Paris Principles , play an important role in the realization of economic , social and cultural rights at the national level , as was stressed by the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No . 10 ( 1998 ) .  
One country stressed that a necessary condition for the success of a conference was that the interests of sending , receiving and transit countries be served by it and that if it proved difficult to achieve a consensus at the global level , a more realistic approach would be to pursue a process of regional consultations , ensuring that the regional groupings involved reflected migration realities and were not necessarily tied to the configuration of the regional commissions .  
Recognizing that , owing to exceptional circumstances , Iraq was the subject of a unique sanctions regime established under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the Board nevertheless stressed the importance of ridding Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction ; of Iraqs full compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions ; and the grave regional and international consequences of Iraqs persistent non-compliance .

That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice .

As in previous years , it is to be stressed that guidelines contained in General Assembly resolutions should be followed , in particular , the desirability of using , as far as possible , the resources and facilities made available by Member States , international organizations and others ; as well as the need , in appointing lecturers for the seminars of the Fellowship Programme , to secure representation of the major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions .

In response , the sponsor delegation pointed to the numerous international organizations and other bodies and entities involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance and stressed the importance of not interfering with their operational procedures and the inadmissibility of using armed force in the provision of humanitarian assistance , which might paralyse the work of international humanitarian organizations and institutions or nullify such activities .  
Let me refer here to the fact that the Security Council has repeatedly stressed in its relevant resolutions that Jerusalem is an indivisible part of the occupied land and that all Israeli measures aimed at changing the legal and demographic status of the city of Jerusalem are null and void .

They stressed that the principle of refraining from the use or threat of force or any other means of coercion or compulsion set forth in the Charter was binding , must be observed by all States and entailed a categorical prohibition on the use of any military-coercive action or any other type of action such as blockades , embargoes or other measures not approved by the international community.Exceptions to that prohibition are clearly and expressly stated in the Charter itself .  
The Commission had stressed the need for promoting increased transparency and appropriate accountability for the implementation of sound national and corporate development policies , which enhance a country ' s abilities to reduce vulnerability to external shocks and volatile flows of short-term capital .

Many Governments stressed that developing countries would need technical and financial assistance from the international community to prepare effectively for and participate in the national and regional preparatory processes .

He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
In this context , the importance of access to scientific and technological information and databases and the threat posed by the ongoing privatization and commodification of such information on the one hand , and of stimulating local innovation without creating exclusive property rights on the other , was stressed .  
Just prior to the Conference , the Ministers of the least developed countries met in Brussels on 13 May 2001 and adopted a Declaration21 in which they stressed that while the primary responsibility for the development of least developed countries rested with these countries themselves , the amelioration of the worsening social economic conditions in the least developed countries required , among other things , substantial and concrete international support measures .
