Besides , the gap of incomes of peasants in developed and poor regions not only has not narrowed , but , on the contrary , has further widened .  
It has been learned that at an informal discussion meeting of a domestic databank on Wednesday , which has not been made public , McVadon specially clarified the main purpose of his speech delivered on Monday . He said he did not mean Taiwan need not deploy the TMD , and he thought because Taiwan is close to the mainland , the early warning time is short , and even if Taiwan has a complete missile defense system , it still can not intercept so many short-range missiles from the other side of the Taiwan Strait .

We have learned from our investigations that pollution in this region is mainly caused by urban sewage and the polluted water discharged by paper mills using straw pulp .  Therefore , so long as we can accelerate the construction of urban sewage treatment plants and intensify efforts in closing down large and small paper mills , the target of meeting the required water standard of Class III along the entire water-delivery line is totally attainable .

Lee survived her college years because she learned early when and to whom it would be safe to speak from her heart , when to conceal her true thoughts , and how to avoid beatings or the excruciating pain of being brainwashed . " I was always nervous , " she says , " not knowing when the Red Guards would find out my real feelings .  
When the children first entered the home they were excited , curious , and obedient . But with the discovery that their counselors were gentle and kind , they became disrespectful of rules . As these women were not completely in favor of ' sparing the rod ' , the boys soon learned they could not always do whatever they pleased .  
Encouraged and influenced by Hsu Ts'ang-tse and Huang Chi-ying and absorbing what he could from Japanese photography magazines , Lin gradually learned the true real meaning of " realistic photography " - - capturing an instant of genuine human feeling while paying attention to every aspect of reality .  
After he completed his military service in 1966 , he got a job as a medical photographer at a U . S . Navy research institute in Taipei . During his twelve years there , he learned many photographic and developing techniques . In his free time he traveled around shooting pictures of people and places he found interesting , and he also got to know Teng Nan-kuang , whose influence resulted in a greater breadth and freedom in his work .  
When he learned who had written it , he tried to visit Hsu whenever he came to Hsin An , but he never succeeded in seeing him .

Recalling that time when he was first struck by computerized printing , Lee seems a bit hesitant and unenthusiastic . " Everybody just cursed .

As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
We had been raised and educated in China , " Yuan says , and they began to feel that being Chinese gave them a lot beyond obvious differences in custom .

For a while now , Li Wen-ling , an elementary school teacher , has led her entire class in reading the classics during activity period . Because this was n't common in schools when she started , she had to play the hard and lonely role of pioneer . In addition to a few parents who looked askance on the activity , her students would ask why they had to recite when other kids did n't and would use the classical Chinese they had learned in class to attack her in their essay books .  
It is just like scholars who stayed in their poorly heated rooms studying for ten years - - by passing the exams , they then set themselves up for life and did n't have to work hard again .

The most important thing emphasized is that whatever has been most recently learned is great learning , useful learning . Everything else is thrown away .  
With an abandoned schoolhouse as their base , they embarked on a program of patient training and rigorous exercise including a daily run of 5,000 meters .

And that 's how the Ondekoza , which is also known as the Divine Children of the Drum , became famous around the world .  
It was July and August , the height of summer . Our rough and ready vessel had no cabin to rest in , and only incomplete equipment .

Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
Chinese have long understood how to listen to the natural music of the soughing pines . This is especially so for those ancient literati who learned that it was their duty to serve their nation , but who could find no ruler who would listen to their criticisms of official corruption and inefficiency . Disappointed by the mundane world , these literati found in pines a salve , admiring how , even in the most remote places , they grew strong .  
Upon his arrival in Taiwan , both supporters of Taiwan independence and of reunification with mainland China staked out their own battle positions . There were some who welcomed him , while those who opposed him protested . Yet , unable to avoid being mired down in their own preconceived , subjective ideology , they could only blur the focus of the Dalai Lama 's visit . The Tibetan leader 's reaction to the scene-to voice support for " freedom of expression " - was truly worthy of admiration , and proved him to be a learned man .  
The discovery of oracle bone inscriptions rebuilt knowledge of a royal dynasty which some had suspected was imaginary , and the many neolithic sites discovered in mainland China over the past few decades have not only shown up even earlier traces of written language , but have also debunked the idea which we learned from childhood , that China 's central plain was the cradle of Chinese civilization .  
Wang Chen-tai notes that early on there were factional conflicts , reducing the religion 's impact . Fortunately , he says , learned elders like Hsieh Sung-tao and Ting Chung-ming wrote inexhaustibly . Also , because of the importance of diplomatic ties with Islamic countries , the ROC government has strongly supported Muslims . The Taipei mosque , which has been the main spiritual and practical resource for Muslims in Taiwan for many years now , was built with government money in response to strong and far-sighted efforts by Ambassador Yeh Kung-chao .  
Although I am still the only Taiwanese person in the city today , and I have to repeat the same explanations about Chinese culture over and over again , I have learned a lot from these people about their culture and customs , and observed the lives of different levels of society .

Miraculously , however , Hsiung recovered the next day . " I learned about death before dying , " comments Hsiung . To keep the specter of recurrent illness at bay these last 40 years , he has trained hard at taijiquan . It was only once he began to feel that he had really learned something that he branched into dance instruction .  
Besides what she learned from her stepmother 's parents , after Wang returned to her own home , her father hired a tutor for her who was also an accomplished painter . Besides teaching her the usual school subjects of Chinese , mathematics , and the like , he systematically introduced her to Chinese art , particularly calligraphy , drawing , and bronze and stone inscriptions . He guided her in learning calligraphy and painting , and gave her a solid foundation .  
Then I came back to work to apply what I 've learned , " explains Hsing . She originally studied land management , but discovered that Taiwan lacks any comprehensive land management policy , leading to rampant overdevelopment and speculation . She decided to go study urban planning . " And then I discovered that urban planning is closely related to environmental management and public policy , so I went from program to program . "  
Chiang Ta-shu says that for many community workers this is an opportunity to rethink their conceptions of community , mutual support , coexistence with nature , and environmental protection . These all have to be learned and practiced in the most basic education , culture and social interaction , and not just remain at the level of mere ideas .  
Many scholar-officials also formed communities out of their own extended families by establishing clan congregations , updating genealogies , and setting up private schools to educate promising youngsters .

She says that at the beginning their limbs were stiff and they were rather inhibited and unwilling to express themselves , and were always looking down at the floor . But as they gradually grew more practiced and skillful , they also learned to open up and display their emotions , and in this way their dancing became more and more confident and beautiful .  
Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
After returning to Taiwan , Chen worked diligently to bring the theory and methods she learned into this country . Working with a social service agency , she handled individual cases of domestic violence . She has come away feeling somewhat powerless and disappointed .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud . But it is no exaggeration to say , as one mainland China cultural maven put it , " Television , film , and pop music are the main channels through which most ordinary people in mainland China have learned about external cultures since the Cultural Revolution . "  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience . Unfortunately , it is very difficult for them to apply the technical infomation they learned , because in most cases they lack the hardware and facilities available in Taiwan . Thus they are only able to apply the theoretical insights they picked up to their own media work at home .  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
I met my husband during high school , when we were both involved in organizing extracurricular activities . After our wedding , we headed off together to the United States for graduate school at Cornell University , but I subsequently learned that I 'm not the right type to work for a PhD . Given the disciplinary division in Western academics , the doctoral scope is too narrow for my broad range of interests .  
Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says Shuang-tzu . As she points out , however , online stories are often posted several at a time , or abandoned half way through when their authors find themselves too busy for writing .  
When Kao was a youngster he dreamed of running like Pasuya , a figure in Tsou myth that could run as fast as a sparrow flies . Kao had learned the story from his father . " I worshipped my father , who had received traditional tribal training as a hunter ! "  
Because the basic aptitude test is only one hurdle , rather than ( as with the previous exams ) a one-shot effort to survey everything the student learned in three years of junior high school or high school , it can place more emphasis on the overall capabilities of the child . Thus , the scope is much broader-no longer limited to school textbooks-while the questions can be framed in a much more lively and flexible way .  
In two years of volunteer life , I made sure that I lived each day to the fullest , for this was a most precious life experience . By living in such a destitute environment , I was able to get a taste of life 's many possibilities . I experienced every possible form of culture shock . I learned how to lighten up and lead a simple life , how to work diligently , and how to make the best of my situation and peacefully live life one day at a time .  
To date there is no scientific evidence that reflexology can cure disease . But for more than 20 years this simple and easily learned method of massage , by which practitioners seek to enhance the self-healing powers of bodily organs by stimulating nerve endings in the body 's extremities , has played an irreplaceable role among the methods of maintaining health practiced by ordinary people in Taiwan .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
" I graduated second to last of my whole elementary school , " Lu explains . " My sister was my homeroom teacher during my first year in junior high . She felt that I learned too slowly , so she had me sent to the special education class . It took me four years to graduate from middle school , and because I could n't pass the high school entrance exam , I went to vocational school .  
Because , in the eyes of an ordinary person , their abilities border on pure magic . A painter uses a brush , a bit of ink , and a few colors to create a world beyond anything we could imagine . A poet takes the words we all learned in elementary school and writes them into verses that people recite for centuries . Musicians compose simple sounds into musical pieces that are played for generations .  
The 10 kite-makers the program has trained since 2002 have done quite well . Under resident master kite-maker Lee Hou-jui 's tutelage , local mothers have not only learned a craft and acquired a source of income , but now also travel to schools all over Taiwan teaching students how to make kites . They were also very successful at last year 's National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports ' Kite Contest , where they won several prizes .  
In 1982 Wu learned of a school run by the Catholic Maryknoll Sisters that had been left empty when student numbers had fallen and was even flooded by a major typhoon .

Li by this time had achieved considerable recognition in Taiwan for his skills , but he was n't satisfied , and so in 1991 he went to Yixing , a famous pottery center in China 's Jiangsu Province , to learn the secret of how the teapots from there got to be so perfect for the function of brewing fine teas . Studying under master potter Qin Youtao , Li learned to make Yixing-style teapots . His aim was to combine artistic sense and utilitarian excellence in his works .  
Thinking back on his childhood , Yeh says that his father often used the free time outside the busy farming season to recite Chinese historical serial novels to his neighbors . Yeh was deeply influenced by his father and loved reading . Under the supervision of NTNU professor Tang Tsu-chung , he read a lot of biographical literature . For this reason Yeh learned that modern Chinese history is made up of heroic figures whose successful deeds were all made possible by " idealism , hope , and determination . "  
China has always been suspicious and fearful of the vast open oceans , indicating that it never learned from Zheng He 's epic voyages how to broaden its horizons and become more accepting of differences . Today , it is Taiwan that is calling itself " a country based on maritime ideals . " How can we open the vast lock of the oceans and turn them into a starting point to embrace the world ?  
Last year , after staff from the Formosa Plastics Group on an overseas inspection tour learned of this mechanism , the company decided to assist Vietnam in developing clean technologies such as cogeneration ( combined heat and power ) and tree planting , and then sell the resulting greenhouse gas reduction credits ( valued at US $ 10 per tonne ) to countries that need them , thus developing a new line of business .  
" Exploration is a scientific endeavor , " he says . Aside from fostering personal courage , the ability to conquer fear , and other valuable characteristics , exploring can refine the skills needed for various outdoor activities and help foster discipline and self-improvement . " As a result , I can pass on the techniques I have learned to even more people . This is the main purpose of exploration , " Chen stresses .  
It was only then that he learned from Wang 's son that that tree was planted by Wang and his wife when they married . After the death of his wife years ago , Wang was very lonely , and that commemorative tree was his only solace . No wonder the old man was so worried and depressed about the tree .  
It was only then that I learned hot showers are regarded as an extravagance . On the very highest point of the north peak , the weather station is almost entirely dependent on rain and snowfall for its water . When the Japanese first built the station in 1943 they constructed a water storage tank in the basement , designed to hold ten tons of water . Unfortunately , the tank is now old and cracked , and leaks so badly it can only hold two or three tons at a time .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says . Filial piety is n't difficult ; one just needs to cater to another 's pleasures . His father , for example , loves to eat a traditional salted pork dish , so Day practiced until he learned the techniques for making it , mastering each step , from choosing the right cut of meat to the actual cooking and dressing of the meat .

The lessons learned so far have proved that without supportive and predictable administrative and legal structures at all levels , and without access to public services particularly to a justice system the private sector and citizens would live in a state of uncertainty and insecurity , hindering the development of their full potential .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;

The Consultative Committee also approved a programme that enables UNIFEM to analyse , publish and disseminate findings and lessons learned from both its own work and experiences gathered in partnership with international , United Nations system , regional and national organizations and networks on promoting women 's political and economic empowerment .  
The main lesson learned from the Yugoslav experience was that swift implementation and strict enforcement of the mandatory measures taken by the Security Council are essential in achieving the objectives of the Council and that adequate arrangements for international cooperation and assistance to States in their endeavour to do so can make a considerable contribution to that effect .  
In addition to the relaxation of the regulations governing the establishment of associations , which has worked greatly to the benefit of learned societies - present in vast numbers in the early 1990s - the State has also encouraged learned societies both by contributing to their annual budgets and by supporting the scientific events which they organize .

Ho Pi-chen , chief executive officer of TWRF , strongly contests the contention of the Japanese government that the comfort women were engaged in private prostitution . In talking with former comfort women from many different countries , Ho has learned : " Most of these women were transported to the front on naval vessels . The comfort stations were built by the military , and the military determined how they were to be run . When the women got sick , they were attended to by military doctors .  
After returning to Taiwan , Chen worked diligently to bring the theory and methods she learned into this country . Working with a social service agency , she handled individual cases of domestic violence . She has come away feeling somewhat powerless and disappointed .  
To say that mainland Chinese look to Taiwan popular culture as an oracle would certainly be blowing our horn a little too loud .

"  
Section chief Victor Chu of the GIO , who has been involved in organizing the camp three times , says that all the participants are very satisfied with the course . After returning home most of them produce newspaper accounts of their experience .

Of course we are well aware that statesmanship ca n't be learned just from a short series of classes , but we hope that by laying on these courses from our standpoint as a cultural and educational foundation , and not from a party political standpoint , we can make a start by using culture and education to purify people 's hearts . Because in fact a real political leader needs to speak from the heart and express his true hopes .  
" The administrator is an impartial observer who does n't get involved in the online discussion , so I learned not to be easily swayed by what is being said , " says Shuang-tzu .

The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms .

Musicians compose simple sounds into musical pieces that are played for generations .  
The 10 kite-makers the program has trained since 2002 have done quite well .

Unfortunately , the tank is now old and cracked , and leaks so badly it can only hold two or three tons at a time .  
" They are always so happy , though , just because I 'm doing the shopping and preparing meals for them , " Day says .
