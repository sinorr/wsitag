To the common people of China , perhaps the reform of the budget planning method has no specific links to their everyday life , but in reality , this reform , which stems from the practical demand of intensifying economic and budgetary supervision , can bring major benefits to the broad masses of the people .  That is , systems-wise , the government 's actions will be standardized , and the fulcrum of forces needed to build a clean government and oppose corruption will be strengthened .

However , according to people who have inside information , the MOF already planned on reforming the budgetary system early on , but did not get down to it .  
Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
Ministry budgetary planning implies that China 's budgetary planning is gradually going on to the scientific , systemized , and standardized track , and the openness , fair , just , and other special qualities that the budgetary planning should posses , as well as the transparency in central budget , will also be improved and increased further .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .
