Before 1973 the primary and secondary students began classes at the same time . Now that the parents have been through grades 1-12 under the same roof , the elementary and junior / senior high schoolers have separate daily flag ceremonies , with the national anthem resounding four times .  
As far back as the time of the prehistoric matriarchal society , the primitive people living in the Yellow River valley had begun to keep dogs .

Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
The shadows cast by war are also reflected in the daily behavior of Chinese refugees from Vietnam . For example , they are used to life in the mountainous wilds , and even when a regular cooking range has been set up in their new billets , they simply leave it unused , for they prefer to pile up several slabs of stone for their cooking fire . And when food is distributed , they are not above snatching or hoarding for they are deadly afraid of not getting another meal .  
For example , the public is allowed to walk through the Po Ai district , but mindful of being watched , everyone 's mood naturally grows more solemn upon entering it . People talk in hushed tones and do n't linger - - let alone line up and make a lot of noise ( the only exception being the music corps responsible for handling the daily flag raising and lowering ceremonies ) .  
In terms of land management , besides continuing the " royal demesne " system , the " garrison field system " was adopted . Under this system , in ordinary times soldiers would farm the land and be self-sufficient . This saved the government money , gave the soldiers land to farm , established a sound foundation for agriculture , and even led to major accomplishments in terms of economic activities important to the daily life of the people ( such as salt and sugar production , water conservancy , and paddy cultivation ) .  
But although this struggle between the dragon and the tiger ended with the tiger spirit being cast down into the world of men , this was not the end of its career , for the practice of creating tiger images spread throughout the people and continued down the ages . In Chinese people 's daily lives and in their rituals , the tiger became an object of artistic appreciation , and its representation gradually developed from a ferocious beast into the cuddly , buffoonish tiger of folk art .  
At the same time , because the environment was simple and more than a hundred students and teachers lived in the mountains day in and day out , the air was fresh and there were few distractions from the outside world . Naturally , they could devote all their hearts to their studies . And the emotional atmosphere went beyond the banal relation of teachers and students to become more like a family . The spirit of City High - - mutual cooperation and upright character - - naturally formed in daily interaction .  
Yinfeng was left with two children less than ten years old . Women in similar situations rushed to remarry in order to meet their daily needs . Fate dictated that not long after the fighting between the Nationalists and Communists stopped , there was an enormous flood , which ruined the just-planted crops .  
NGOs to date have no effective channels to participate in the countless detailed activities of public administration that are underway on a daily basis . Nevertheless , NGO personnel may indeed be recruited by specialized consultative committees to help formulate policy for major issues .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
For example , to get his patients to release their emotions , he uses the Buddhist tantric " methods for seeing and thinking " as well as methods making use of modern physics that involve light , heat and magnetism . He teaches patients to use deep meditation to focus their energy on the part of the body that is uncomfortable in daily life . He also uses yoga to dispel accumulated depressed energy through relaxing the body .  
" Archaeological sites in Taiwan have flaked tools like these from the paleolithic to the late neolithic eras , " notes Liu . From the standards of craftsmanship in their jade and decorative jewelry , it is clear that these people of ancient times were not without skill . However , it appears that as far as implements for daily use are concerned , their attitude may well have been " it 's enough if it 's usable . "  
With an abandoned schoolhouse as their base , they embarked on a program of patient training and rigorous exercise including a daily run of 5,000 meters . The students learned that while drumming , every bodily action-from breathing to using arm muscles-had to be done in a particular way . And that 's how the Ondekoza , which is also known as the Divine Children of the Drum , became famous around the world .  
It was n't that I had no interest in reading it , but rather was unable to get away from the constant stream of daily activities that keep me busy . Then , however , when I finally struggled through to the second chapter , I read about the idea of " active laziness . " Rinpoche says : " Our lives seem to live us , to possess their own bizarre momentum , to carry us away ; in the end we feel we have no choice or control over them . "  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
These past few years , unrelentingly high housing prices and crowded public spaces have been among the ubiquitous symptoms that Taipei City , constrained as it is within a ring of mountains , is filled to bursting point . In search of a better quality of life , more and more people are moving out to the suburbs , and Taipei 's dormitory zone has spread as far as Hsinchu and Miaoli . How much private and public time and resources are consumed by their daily commute ?  
Li Yih-yuan has discovered that the logic of the almanacs-to seek safety through knowing when to act and when not to-has , in modern commercial society , been transformed . It has been adapted to daily life , especially to the pragmatic pursuit of profit .  
Huang Chien-yi also reveals that in a future textbook edition which is still at the experimental stage , historical and mythical exemplary personages have almost disappeared , and the few remaining representative persons are all taken from daily life . The old style of teaching loyalty and filial piety by expecting children to model themselves on saints and sages is to disappear .  
Recently natural wild plants have become popular foods in Taiwan , and aboriginal edible plants have become well-known in the process . However , edible plants account for only one-quarter of the plants used in daily life in Taniao village . Besides the necessities ( food , shelter , clothing ) , plants are essential materials for a huge number of other uses-medicine , landmarks , all kinds of tools used for outdoor work , rope , packaging , sandpaper , and cloth .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
Lin Chia-jung points out that junior high math teachers are too hurried in the way they teach . Students have had insufficient previous experience with abstract reasoning , and because complex geometrical concepts are unconnected to daily life , geometry becomes a source of math anxiety .  
These various musuems large and small not only pioneer new aspects of culture and enrich existing ones , they are spread across the island and are flexibly run , closing the psychological distance between museums and the public at large . They are educational and recreational resources that have become part of people 's daily lives .  
The park was originally approved to release a maximum of 28,200 kiloliters of treated effluent per day . But in October and November of last year , the electronics industry was booming and the volume of effluent increased rapidly . Treated waste water from the park hit a record high of over 72,000 kiloliters . And recently average daily discharge has been running at around 53,000 kiloliters .  
Chinese have been drinking tea for thousands of years , and it has long been a routine part of daily life . It appears in the traditional Chinese list of " essential items " for the kitchen , right up there with rice , soy sauce , oil , firewood , salt and vinegar . The late Lin Yutang described it as " a widespread custom that has added much color to everyday life of the people . "  
As women have rewritten their gender characteristics , some reassessment has been made of the male box . It has been discovered that this rigid box has not only crushed women and children under it , it has also deformed men-those allegedly advantaged by it . It has stifled their emotions , destroyed their health , reduced the happiness they get out of daily life , and made them lonely and violent .  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
You can find as succinct a description of Zhu Xi 's importance as any in the Taiwan middle-school textbook History of Chinese Culture , which notes that Zhu Xi spent a lifetime annotating the Confucian classics , and established his own academies to teach others . It declaims : " You could say that , prior to the ascendance of Western power , Zhu Xi had the greatest influence on East Asian civilization of any one individual . His spirit permeated the daily lives , outlooks , and spiritual inclinations of Chinese people . "  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
Anything to lift us above the humdrum reality of daily life . It 's the same old story : events get embellished with every telling until they enter the realm of myth . For example , look how folklore has handled the characters of Zhuge Liang and Guan Gong . The historical record shows that the real Guan Gong did n't even have moustache , let alone the bushy beard that he 's now credited with in the popular imagination .  
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared by all have been replaced by a growing diversity of individual experiences . In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while others lose their jobs and are faced with poverty ; working women find themselves squeezed between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and their jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .  
Fossil fuels are deeply embedded in our daily lives . They are required for virtually all electrical power and fuel , and industries such as petrochemicals and steel ; indeed it is hard to find any modern economic sector that does not need them . Therefore , to demand a decrease in CO2 emissions is asking people to accept a dramatic adjustment to modern life , with a corresponding impact on the economy .  
Calligraphy certainly does have the ability to cure disease . Once suffering from a hyperactive thyroid due to the pressures of a fast-paced life , Lin Jui-yao was diagnosed by his doctor as needing to take medicine for the long term . But he abandoned drugs completely , practicing calligraphy eight hours daily and immersing himself in his inner world . His endocrine system gradually became balanced and he was healed .  
Because there is no history of breast cancer in her family , after the illness she took a good look at herself , and felt that the problem must be rooted in her bad daily habits . When filming , she would eat four boxed lunches-typically fried chicken or pork chops-every day . These , she realized , probably were n't doing her any good . Nor , she figured , were the long hours she works while in production .  
" My eldest brother was beaten more than any of us when he was little , but now he is the most devoted , " notes a senior newspaper reporter , who is one of three siblings . When they were young , their father hit her older brother or forced him to kneel in punishment on a daily basis . Even when she or her younger brother did something wrong , their parents still punished her older brother for not teaching his younger siblings to behave correctly .  
A thoroughgoing pragmatist is apt to be bound up in the daily round , blinkered , and convinced that only profit and loss are absolute . Let us occasionally be like philosophers - - a little reserved and suspicious .  
" These women and children have no support at all from friends or the bride 's family . When they run into problems they are lost , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The language barrier often means they have no clue about how to seek help , to the point where they even accept violence as a natural part of their daily life , as their unalterable fate . This is the reason foreign brides suffer a high level of domestic violence .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
At the height of its production the Wushulin plant pressed as much as 1,600 metric tons of cane daily . Not only did Wushulin have a huge capacity , its products were of excellent quality and were specially designated for use by the Japanese royal household . As a result , the plant was much praised by the colonial " motherland . "  
Some say the family is like a refuge where members can find shelter from life 's trials and hardships . Others say the family is like a financial institution that provides for daily necessities . Some people liken the family to a silk cocoon-warm and comfortable but closed off and restrictive . Yet others liken the family to a poisonous snake where members are bound together , but by bonds of hatred and dislike instead of love and caring .  
Michelle Sung Ing / tr . by Michael Hill Lighthouses are built to guide ships at sea , and many are built on barren , uninhabited islands that are normally hardly visited at all , other than by a few fishermen who come during the fishing season . Lighthouse keepers rely completely on periodic deliveries of food , water , and daily necessities from supply boats , and thus all lighthouse keepers are trained to be versatile , and must take care of all housing maintenance , including electrical work , metal work , woodworking , and painting .  
The mountain Karen still make a living through such traditional methods as swidden farming , fishing , hunting and gathering , working hard to eke out an existence each and every day .

Aside from the perils of daily life , the great exploits of history that are worthy of the name " exploration " were highly focused in their goals . Tang-dynasty monk Xuanzang 's 17-year quest for Buddhist scriptures in India , Genghis Khan 's long westward campaign to take Khwarazm , or the " voyages of discovery " of Zheng He in the late 14th century and the Spanish and Portuguese in the 15th , were daring adventures that reaped rich rewards and inspired many to follow after .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post .

In addition , at a time when the North-South gap continues to widen on a daily basis , the world economic trend , manipulated by unilateral actions and protectionist policies on the part of the developed countries , also tends further to debilitate the potential of the developing countries to deal with the adverse impacts of international economic development .  
In addition to the great efforts to reform the United Nations system and thus enable the Organization to meet the growing challenges of the future , the practice of transparency by which I mean a daily striving for real contributions to be made to the Council 's decision-making process by all countries concerned is a feasible and practicable course .

With regard to the institution-building process , it was said that despite the many daily problems and challenges , the institutional development should not be carried out on an ad hoc basis , but be seen in its local , regional and national dimensions , which required strategic thinking and vision .  
Such crises may save various sources , continue for varying periods of time , and disrupt governmental performance to varying degrees , but their primary characteristic is that the existing national Government is unable to meet the immediate daily requirements of its population or to build a viable basis for sustainable development without external assistance .  
The second main recommendation of the task force was that additional activities should be undertaken to improve immediately the existing basic and social services infrastructure in order to make tangible improvements in the daily lives of the Palestinian people , provide much-needed employment opportunities in the implementation phase and help in the development of essential infrastructure in support of the incoming Palestinian Authority .

In a 1994 study on the Office of the Spokesperson , prepared by a consultant , it was noted that reporters say that it is rare that the daily briefing offers a story on the main news topic of the day ; even in the midst of major news events in which the United Nations is central , no comment is offered that has not been released in , e.g . , Sarajevo or Geneva hours earlier , nor is meaningful background described to put events in perspective . 
As long as more than one eighth of Lebanon is occupied and Israeli raids continue to blow up power stations , to interrupt daily life , to stifle the population with their aerial bombardment , killing women , children and the elderly before the eyes of the entire international community , the Security Council 's equating of aggressor and victim in its approach to Lebanon 's complaints will remain devoid of justice .
