The Committee recommends that special protective measures be implemented in relation to children living in rural areas , children who are victims of abuse , children of single-parent families , children born out of wedlock , abandoned , institutionalized and disabled children , children involved with the juvenile justice system , particularly when deprived of their liberty , children involved in child labour and children who , in order to survive , are forced to live and / or work in the streets .  
While the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) , which was adopted by the General Assembly by resolution 46 / 151 of 18 December 1991 , represented a global compact between African countries on the one hand and the international community on the other , the conclusions and recommendations of the Ad Hoc Committee submitted for adoption at this session constitute a set of common and complementary objectives and targets to be implemented in an integrated manner and in a spirit of full partnership .  
Instead , as can be seen in the conclusions that form the annex to the draft resolution submitted to the Assembly , the Working Groups identified selected areas in which to carry out a fair and impartial assessment of achievements over the past five years , and produced concrete and realistic recommendations to be implemented through cooperation and partnership among all the parties concerned .  
He hoped that the Decade 's programme of activities would be implemented fully and that problems faced by indigenous people in such areas as human rights , the environment , development , education and health would be solved effectively through efforts at the national level and greater international cooperation .  
A prerequisite for the smooth functioning of information exchange during the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly is the designation , by all Parties involved in AIJ , of the relevant governmental authority or ministry authorized to accept , approve or endorse activities implemented jointly and to report on them to the Conference of the Parties through the secretariat ( FCCC / SBSTA / 1996 / 8 , para .  NULL  
The persistence of problems , such as poor procurement planning , inadequate attention to the internal audit function , and failure on the part of implementing agencies to comply with agreements , could only be interpreted as a signal that the administrations concerned were still failing to give due priority to ensuring that agreed recommendations of the Board were fully implemented .  
DUSCHNER ( Canada ) , speaking on behalf of Australia , Canada and New Zealand , said that her delegation was pleased with the success of the new budget cycle implemented pursuant to General Assembly resolution 49 / 233 , since it had streamlined the administrative and budgetary process for the financing of peacekeeping .  
He commended the Commissioner 's efforts to restructure the Centre for Human Rights and emphasized the need for extensive consideration of that question by Member States and guidance by the General Assembly before action was taken .  The right to development was a fundamental human right and must be fully respected and implemented on a firm financial basis .  
Under this section , States parties are requested to provide information on the measures adopted to ensure that the civil rights and freedoms of children set forth in the Convention , in particular those covered by articles 7 , 8 , 13 to 17 and 37 ( a ) , are recognized by law specifically in relation to children and implemented in practice , including by administrative and judicial bodies , at the national , regional and local levels , and where appropriate at the federal and provincial levels .  
The commitments , recommendations and measures agreed upon at recent major international conferences must be implemented in a spirit of mutual accountability and cooperation , and in a new global partnership addressing the critical social and economic issues of development .  
First , a modern , fair and transparent personnel policy , in which placement and promotion played an important part , and the strict implementation of that policy were crucial determinants of the effective future performance of the Organization . The General Assembly , in resolution 47 / 226 , had urged the Secretary-General to improve all personnel policies , yet that requirement had still not been implemented .  
While different legal systems contained varying provisions concerning the validity of an arbitral award , no existing international instrument or customary practice envisaged the possibility that an arbitral award in an international dispute would not be implemented as a result of objections raised by one party to the dispute .  
The Group of 77 and China were willing to consider the projected vacancy rates for the 1996-1997 biennium , with the following provisos : that the Secretary-General should not exceed those rates and should certify at the end of the biennium that all mandated programmes had been fully implemented ; that those rates had been accepted by the General Assembly on an exceptional basis , and should not set a precedent for any future budgets ; and that they should not be used to accommodate any additional unfunded mandates in the overall level of appropriations .  
While the territorial and maritime frontier dispute between the Republic of Cameroon and the Federal Republic of Nigeria is pending before the International Court of Justice , Nigerian authorities have just put into operation electrification and drinking-water supply projects , which , in spite of protests by Cameroon , they implemented in Abana , a town occupied by Nigerian troops and set up as an administrative unit of the federal Nigerian state of Cross River .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management ; the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
It has built hospitals and medical centres to treat patients free of charge ; offered educational programmes for Afghan students ; trained Afghan medical groups ; implemented a comprehensive and continuous plan of child vaccination ; given necessary materials to orphanages ; and provided food and non-food assistance , often on a daily basis .  
Notes with concern that the overall low level of contributions to the Environment Fund received and pledged for the biennium 1996-1997 not only has fallen short of the Governing Council 's estimates by a significant margin but also will not enable the programme of activities approved by the Governing Council for the biennium 1996-1997 to be fully implemented ;  
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
The first one is that , by having established and implemented the largest compensation operation in history in record time and at minimum cost , the international community , acting through the United Nations , has confirmed the potential and capacity of the world organization to meet new and unprecedented challenges and to do it better than such operations performed outside its scope .  
Consequently , if the proposals are to apply both at the international level and at the national level , they must be articulated in such a way that those to be implemented at the international level have a counterpart in the standards and mechanisms designed to be applied in the internal system of States .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
In Gambia , for example , the 1994 Act on Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides Control and Management contains a provision that international notification schemes relating to chemicals and pesticides , including the prior informed consent procedures , are to be implemented . 94 Some other examples of national legal implementation of the principle of prior consultation are directly linked to regulations regarding environmental impact assessment procedures . 
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences , and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their extraterritorial effects , inter alia , on the economic and social development of targeted countries and peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States ,  
The Committee recommends that special protection measures be adopted and implemented in relation to children living and / or working in the street , children in conflict with the law , in particular those deprived of liberty , children affected by or infected with HIV / AIDS , including orphans , abused and exploited children and children involved with child labour .

With regard to bilateral and multilateral treaties , the five States reported that they had signed a significant number of treaties concerning the protection of the environment , some of which contained penal provisions , and had implemented them in national legislation .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
Deeply concerned that , despite the recommendations adopted on this issue by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations , unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the socio _ humanitarian activities of developing countries , including their extraterritorial effects , thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals ,  
An illustrative example of a global strategy developed by a private-sector association is that implemented by London Medicine [ 33 ] , which has two main objectives : promoting and developing business opportunities for London Medicine 's affiliates in order to increase the flows of clinical , educational and research work in London 's hospitals and medical schools , and to attract research contracts and investment from British and international companies .  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Where countries have developed effective temporary strategies in an attempt to achieve equality of participation , a wide range of measures has been implemented , including recruiting , financially assisting and training women candidates , amending electoral procedures , developing campaigns directed at equal participation , setting numerical goals and quotas and targeting women for appointment to public positions such as the judiciary or other professional groups that play an essential part in the everyday life of all societies .  
The Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire was implemented and the deadlines and procedures established therein were strictly observed , confirming the willingness of the Government and URNG to put a definitive end to the armed conflict , as evidenced throughout 1996 in the peace negotiations and in the informal ceasefire which went into effect on 19 March 1996 .  
A diverse number of programmes and projects financed by the international community were implemented to support the rural reintegration process , among them programmes for basic agricultural training for almost 10,431 ex-combatants from both sides , follow-up agricultural technical assistance programmes to aid ex-combatants in the formulation of productive farming strategies , training of local agricultural technical assistance promoters and programmes providing basic shelter and , subsequently , building materials for the construction of more permanent housing .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
Many States have successfully implemented comparatively rapid procedures at points of entry which ensure a fair and competent assessment of the need for international protection , and UNHCR encourages States to ensure the rights of the individual through proper legal safeguards , in developing such procedures .  
Additional complementary programmes , designed and implemented in the past 18 months , include training in negotiation skills and conflict resolution , special development programmes for successful G to P and national competitive entry candidates , supervisory skills training for senior General Service and Junior Professionals with supervisory responsibilities and a programme on General Service effectiveness .  
These should provide in particular protection of contractual agreements and an even playing field between domestic and foreign investors ( therefore preventing discrimination against foreign investors ) , and policy formulation should be consistent and well planned so that partial reversals or inconsistent legislation are not implemented later .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
Taking into account the substantial quantitative and qualitative differences between the needs of individual countries , his Government had felt that separate programmes for humanitarian assistance and assistance with recovery and development should be implemented for each country , rather than administered by a supranational structure established within the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States for the distribution or redistribution of humanitarian and other forms of assistance .  
The ability of the United Nations to react in a timely , efficient and effective manner , often at short notice , underpins the need for an integrated operational concept from which subsequent strategies can be developed and implemented .  
With regard to legislation , while noting with satisfaction the legal and legislative arrangements developed and implemented for the protection of land and sacred sites , including religious objects , and for the return of the religious and cultural heritage , the Special Rapporteur recommends ensuring uniformity of such legislation at the Federal and State levels , as well as its effectiveness in relation to its assigned objective , particularly by identifying and remedying shortcomings and loopholes .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
Accordingly , when we constantly stress the overriding need for compliance with the principle of parallelism between the sale of petroleum and the provision of the food , medicine and other humanitarian needs included in the procurement and distribution plan , we do so for sound legal and logical reasons , since the proceeds from the sale of petroleum is to be used to purchase supplies with a view to distributing them quickly to the entire population of Iraq , thereby ensuring that all the elements of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) are implemented simultaneously .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
The decision concerning the sound management of chemicals adopted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme at its nineteenth session [ 29 ] should be implemented in accordance with the agreed timetables for negotiations on the conventions relating to prior informed consent and persistent organic pollutants .  
May I recall , in this respect , my letter to your predecessor ( A / 50 / 216-S / 1995 / 476 ) dated 9 June 1995 , with which I brought to his attention the similar threats , expressed at the highest and most official political level in Turkey through the resolution adopted on 8 June 1995 by the Turkish National Assembly , empowering the Turkish Government to declare war if Greece implemented the Convention on the Law of the Sea and exercised her legitimate right to extend her national territorial waters to 12 miles . 
The Programme shall be implemented in particular but not exclusively , in the following fields : political , legal , administrative , internal affairs , economic , social , cultural , educational , reconstruction and return and the media .  
That training is implemented in cooperation with the five education development centres , one in each Field , and covers a wide range of courses of one - , two - or three-year duration aimed at certifying unqualified elementary and preparatory teachers or vocational training instructors , meeting curricular changes and developing the supervisory and leadership skills of senior education staff .  
Since governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals have important roles to play in ensuring that human rights are respected , national human rights education strategies and plans of action should be developed and implemented by a creative mixture of all of such entities .  These Guidelines are not intended as a blueprint for a nationally coordinated effort in human rights education .  
UNCLOS is acknowledged to be an " umbrella convention " because most of its provisions , being of a general nature , can only be implemented through specific operative regulations to be contained in other international agreements or national law .

With regard to the Boards principal findings on the voluntary funds administered by UNHCR , he said that as far as previous recommendations not fully implemented were concerned the main persistent irregularities were the non-assessment of the capabilities of implementing partners ; delays in the submission of project-monitoring reports ; the selective basis on which work plans were prepared ; and the failure of implementing partners to maintain separate accounts for UNHCR funds .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of the adjustment policy being implemented , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
For decades , it has been growing dangerously worse and , as part of this process , the structural adjustment policies implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in the countries of the southern hemisphere and in central and eastern Europe are having disastrous social consequences .  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
They have also stressed that such sanctions should not be based merely on political expediency , but rather should be firmly based on international law ; that they should be implemented according to the principles of justice and international law ; that they should not serve individual or factional interests ; that in their implementation , consideration should be given to the human suffering that they cause ; and that a time limit should be set for their lifting .  
At the same time , these anti-poverty strategies are to be defined and implemented in the larger context of creating an environment that encourages and supports equitable , broad-based economic growth and social development at both the national and international levels .  
In the United States , we have raised the minimum wage , expanded tax credits for working families and reduced the federal deficit , all of which provide the basis for investment , growth and job creation .  The lesson we have learned is that a flexible job market that facilitates mobility , an economy open to competition and sound monetary and fiscal policies implemented by a Government that is representative , transparent and accountable , all contribute to the creation of jobs .  
The intimate relationship between disarmament and non-proliferation commitments , on the one hand , and free trade and cooperation for peaceful purposes , on the other , is reflected in this article , and it is thus essential that the careful balance be preserved as the Convention is implemented .  
Activities are being implemented to support national initiatives through policy-oriented research and programme analysis based on country , subregional and regional studies and demonstration projects ; exchange of experience and expertise through the organization of conferences , seminars and training workshops ; advisory services in support of national social development initiatives ; and exchange of personnel and the provision of training opportunities through technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) .

The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
The Workshop strongly recommends that a regional technical cooperation programme be designed and implemented as a matter of urgent priority in partnership with the Centre for Human Rights of the United Nations , under its technical cooperation programme , with a view to facilitating the sharing of experience , expertise and best practices within the region to further enhance national and regional human rights capacities .  
First , once they are fully implemented , the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture , market access reforms in manufactured and industrial products , and the phasing out of the Multifibre Agreement in textiles trade are projected to raise global income substantially ( estimates range from an increase of US $ 40-billion to one of US $ 215-billion relative to the 1992 base period gross domestic product of approximately US $ 23-trillion ) .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .

The measures to prevent and control the phenomenon , which need to be elaborated and implemented at the national and international levels , cut across the economic , social , cultural , political and legal fields .  
Stresses that the regional cooperation programme could , inter alia , focus upon the request of Governments concerned , on strengthening the role of national human rights institutions in promoting the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights , realizing the right to development , developing methodologies for effective implementation of human rights education , elaborating guidelines for national action plans in the field of human rights , and developing strategies for cooperation on common problems , which should be implemented by drawing upon the expertise within the region to the fullest extent ;  
While the United Nations has long experience in implementing humanitarian programmes during periods of peace , conflict and post-conflict situations , it should be emphasized that the humanitarian programme pursuant to resolution 986 ( 1995 ) is unique and is being implemented within the context of a sanctions regime with all its attendant political and commercial dimensions .  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS .

A list of the 27 agreements of continuing validity , current as at 27 November , appears in annex I . Taken together with the provisions of the Croatian Constitution , those agreements , for which the Government of Croatia has made itself internationally accountable , provide a comprehensive political and institutional framework of guarantees , which , if fully implemented , will allow the people of the region to exercise freely their rights and obligations as equal citizens of Croatia . 
Serbs are also concerned that proportional representation in senior posts has not been achieved and that a planned major downsizing of medical staff will be implemented in a discriminatory manner .  
Generally speaking , the capitalist revolution ( free-market reforms and well-conceived and prudently implemented privatization in the post cold war period ) has increased foreign investment , streamlined the public sector and reduced inflation , bringing about a significant level of stability and prosperity .  
The invited experts , who had included members of the Palestinian Council , the Israeli Knesset and the European Parliament and leading academics from different regions , had made presentations in three plenary sessions , which had been followed by lively and frank discussions that had reflected the great concern of all participants that the accords concluded by the parties should be implemented and the peace process continued .  
While the operation is financed from income accruing as a result of a limited exception to the sanctions regime , the resolution prescribes numerous safeguards to be implemented in order to ensure that the humanitarian assistance is not used for purposes other than those specifically authorized and that it benefits , in equal measure , the needy civilian population as a whole .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
With regard to the right to education ( arts . 28 and 29 ) , while noting that the principle of free , universal and compulsory basic education for all children is recognized by the State party , the Committee is concerned that this fundamental right is not yet fully and equally implemented throughout the country .

We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
The agreements reached by Committee members to set up a subregional early warning mechanism , to control the illicit trade in arms and drugs , to retrain demobilized troops for civilian life and to enhance the capacity of Central African States to participate more effectively in future peace missions in the area would , if implemented , contribute significantly to continuing efforts to end the scourge of violence , destruction and suffering in the subregion . 
The purpose of the special session should not be to renegotiate Agenda 21 or to redefine the principles and objectives of sustainable development , but rather to identify priority sectoral issues that required follow-up at the international level .  The outcomes of other United Nations conferences held since the Rio Conference should also be taken into account in order to avoid duplication of ongoing work or work which had already been implemented in other international forums .  
We suggest that the 661 Committee should conduct an objective , professional and administrative review of the manner in which the previous phase of the procurement and distribution plan has been implemented , with a view to eliminating all the negative aspects and procedures that led to the delay and dilatoriness by which it was characterized , and which all but emptied Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the memorandum of understanding of their content and turned them into something to be exploited for political purposes that bear no relation to any humanitarian objective . 
UNPF implemented a complicated and time-consuming exercise of converting multiple inventory databases , supported by individual asset managers , into a single , unified mission-wide inventory database based on the REALITY systems fixed assets module .

Convinced that the magnitude of current difficulties called for additional measures for resolving the debt problems of the developing countries , Norway had launched a new national strategy which , in addition to supporting and strengthening already existing multilateral schemes , included bilateral debt reduction measures that would be implemented over and above the reductions granted under multilateral operations .  
Comprehensive revised guidelines for these types of contracts have been developed and will be implemented in 1999 , bearing in mind the primary objective of achieving value for money in an efficient and expeditious manner .  
The Programme is playing a catalytic role in the development of a comprehensive and reliable international monitoring mechanism , including the development of a scientifically sound yield assessment methodology and the determination of yield figures for selected countries to guide and assess the progress of measures implemented by the international community to eliminate or significantly reduce the illicit cultivation of cannabis , coca and opium poppy by the year 2008 .  
With the rapid accumulation of satellite technology and the resulting expansion in Koreas space programme , a wide range of international cooperative activities are being implemented by the Republic of Korea and other countries at the regional and global levels .

Affirming that , in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements5 it was recognized , inter alia , that the Habitat Agenda could only be effectively implemented if the role and functions of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) were strengthened and adequate financial resources , including new and additional resources from all sources , were mobilized at the national and international levels ,  
The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .
