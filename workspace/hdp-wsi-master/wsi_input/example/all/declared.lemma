In the 1950s , Taiwan received a great deal of aspirations to escape from the post-war hardships and to catch up with advanced Western civilization , young artists organized the " Orient " and " May " art associations .

The central level reform issues came up first . Even before the conference began , the KMT 's dual executive mixed system idea was being attacked on all sides .

Some boldly declared that the proposal was simply intended to pave the way for Lee Teng-hui to run for re-election .  
Over the years the HUF has prepared guided introductions to six trails , with the most popular being the Chihshan Rock Trail in Shihlin , which combines natural scenery with Class Two historic cultural artifacts .

Worried , the MOF , acting through the Keelung Tariff Bureau , then decided to reclaim its portion of Wistaria House at the end of July , before the city government had publicly declared the teahouse a historic landmark .

All that was left of the teahouse was Chou Yu 's two-story Western-style house , forcing him " to run the ship on half an engine . "

In great universities , all the various ideas co-exist : the philosophic schools of materialism and idealism , the aesthetic schools of realism and romanticism , the economic schools of mercantilism and laissez-faire , the ethical schools of moral purpose and utilitarianism , and the cosmological schools of optimism and negativism . That is why universities are ' universal , ' " declared Tsai .

Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Each week , the segment features three well-developed hunks dressed in swim suits . Following a short conversation between each contestant and the hosts , female audience members approach the stage to place stickers on their favorite choice , and the contestant with the most stickers is declared the winner .

Evidently some people have found chess so addictive that they have neither slept nor rested , and there is a saying to the effect that " thoughts of spring make it hard to sleep , but chess can help pass a clear night .

What about the three main candidates ? Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which advocates Taiwan independence , produced a long and detailed white paper on China policy , which offered some changes and reservations to the independence position .

However , WTO regulations require that exemptions be declared prior to application for entry . Given Taiwan 's current weak diplomatic position , unless the PRC agrees to the exemption , it will be difficult for Taiwan to get the required support of two-thirds of the 137 WTO member states for this escape clause . In sum , Kinmen people remain optimistic that the arguments in favor of the little three links will win out .  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung .

In an article published on December 25 , the United Daily News declared that , given the trend of economic globalization , the opening of the three links across the Taiwan Strait should bring unprecedented growth in cross-strait economic ties .

Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
Last March the Grand Justices rendered a constitutional interpretation when the ruling and opposition parties were wrangling over a proposed term extension for all members of the National Assembly . The justices ruled that the decision making process violated the National Assembly 's rules of order and went against the principle that all decisions must be open and transparent . After the term extension was declared invalid , retaliatory constitutional amendments were proposed in the National Assembly to abolish the Council of Grand Justices and strip the justices of their lifetime stipends .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
Many family pedigrees in the local area also provide evidence of the fearsome loss of life that occurred . The deluge even came to the attention of the emperor himself , who ordered the imperial granary to ship emergency rice supplies .

The basalt islands , like black pearls across the Western Pacific , are glittering assets of the common heritage of mankind .  
Yet no matter what political slogans may have declared , no matter how popular nostalgic soap operas about the mainland were or how authentic the cuisine remained , none of these things could overcome one basic fact-the two sides were separated for 40 years , during which there was no contact , families were separated , no one traveled to see the mainland 's famous scenery , and all we could know about what was going on behind the PRC 's " bamboo curtain " were shocking photographs of famine years .  
Premier Yu Shyi-kun declared that the ruling party would handle the protest in a gentle , transparent , and open manner , and expressed understanding and respect for any lawsuits that the pan-blue camp might bring with regard to the election .

Going from creative ideas to practical applications takes very pragmatic skills , like patient experimentation and testing , requiring total focus and concentration .

Turning to cross-strait matters , President Chen , pointing to the recent enlargement of the European Union , declared that the trend toward regionalization has led to fundamental changes in conventional thinking about national sovereignty and territorial boundaries , and expressed hope that leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait would heed this trend and adopt a fresh new framework to find a way out of the tense cross-strait situation .

To those who long ago declared invalid any legal measure of a foreign country against their businessmen and nationals , we here send a message of hope : Cuba , the island of the bold , is not going to turn away from the road it has taken ; it will not violate the hopes and trust of its friends or partners , in spite of threats and multilateral or bilateral measures that someone might try to impose upon it .
