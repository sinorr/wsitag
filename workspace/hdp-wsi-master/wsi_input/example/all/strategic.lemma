Guangdong 's electronic industry has realized the strategic shift " from a domestic sales focus to an overseas sales focus " , and product exports increased swiftly .  In 1995 , 7.325-million telephones , 3.19-million TV sets , 10.65-million radio tape recorders , and nearly 3-million sets of hi-fi equipment were exported .  The export volume accounted for 50% - 90% of the total output respectively and the export deliveries have ranked first in China for many years running .  
He said that next year 's main tasks of economic system reform will be : maintaining the direction of socialist market economy reform , further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of creating a modern enterprise system for state-owned enterprises , vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring , to appropriately arrange placement for extraneous personnel leaving posts , implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms , continuing to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ;  
Tieying Li pointed out that China would actively promote the strategic restructuring of state-owned enterprises using the principle of " grasping the large ones and letting the little ones go " as a major premise .  When rebuilding state-owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure , and when using capital as the link for structuring parent-subsidiary corporate systems to smooth out reasonable internal group relations , we need to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " arbitrarily creating piles " .  
It is reported that the main contents of these new measures include promoting strategic restructuring of provincial foreign trade companies to focus on developing scaled operations and organizing enterprise groups ; to expand the extent of exporting backbone industries products ; and to successfully organize the Foreign Business Investment and Business Invitation Conference held in Hong Kong and the ' 98 China Investment and Trade Negotiation Conference , etc .  
The decreasing speed of eastern crude oil fields has slowed down clearly , whereas the increasing speed of western crude oil fields has been constantly accelerating .  The strategic pattern of " stabilizing the east and developing the west " has basically taken shape .  
Leaders of respective places and units are convinced that General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech has penetratingly analyzed the current situation and existing problems in party building from the strategic level of initiating a great project to improve the party , has incisively explained the great significance and utmost importance of tightening party discipline under the new situation , has put forward demands for tightening party discipline , and has clearly pointed out directions for improving the party 's style of work , promoting the building of a clean and honest government and launching struggles against corruption .  
At the special symposium on China held on the 29th , Vice Premier Wu Bangguo delivered a speech entitled " China 's Economy Gears To the 21st Century " and introduced to the participants the strategic key points of China 's future economic development , which include the strategic readjustments of the economic structure and the implementation of the strategy to open up the western region and other grand plans .  
Viewing the matter in a strategic national destiny and national rejuvenation perspective , the article profoundly pointed out that correctly guiding and helping young students grow up healthy and sound and enabling them to develop in an all-round way - - morally , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically - - is a major issue that has a bearing on the direction of China 's education development .  
It was because of the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots ' profound will of safeguarding reunification and opposing splittism that Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui } restrained himself while engaging in splittist activities and the Democratic Progressive Party looked squarely at the reality that " Taiwan independence is a poison affecting the garnering of votes . "  So time and again they put forward the so-called " new middle line " and other slogans and made strategic adjustments in their " Taiwan independence " advocacy in an effort to gain votes by cheating .  
The " Program on Building Headquarters " upholds the guidance of Mao Zedong Military Thought , Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building during the new period , and a series of Jiang Zemin 's important expositions on army building ; is based on the military strategic principle in the new period ; and adopts the principle of building a quality army and strengthening the army with science and technology , thereby making a unified standard for comprehensive construction of our army 's headquarters .  
In the face of the strategic readjustment of the agricultural and rural economic structures , we should quickly change the ideas , concepts , leading methods , and the quality of cadres and the masses that are not compatible with the situation in structural readjustment and bring about a tremendous change in the way of thinking and working methods .  
We need to focus on the key strategic plans for national economic development , mobilizing the advantage of overseas Chinese resources to the service of the strategies of revitalizing China through science and education and sharply developing western China .  
Wu Yi said : In recent years , with the direct efforts of leaders of the two countries , relations between China and Russia have maintained a steady , healthy and satisfactory trend .  The level of strategic cooperation has been raised steadily with notable results .  
During study and discussion , these localities generally said that the speech made by General Secretary Jiang Zemin at Guangdong 's Gaozhou City and the speeches delivered by the six standing committee members of the Central Political Bureau in these six localities are profound , rich and realistic in content , out of an overall strategic consideration and in light of the actual situation of the building of the county ( city ) leading groups and the leading cadre ranks .  
The central leading comrades have come to the grassroots units , directly heard grassroots cadres ' briefings and pertinently pointed out problems .  This fact fully shows their understanding , trust and loving care of grassroots cadres , shows the high degree of importance attached by the Party Central Committee to the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level , shows their firm conviction in Marxism and the strategic vision of them as party and state leaders , and shows the correctness of the policy decision made by the Party Central Committee .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Whether viewed through the prism of history or the present , there are bright prospects for Sino-Russian cooperation .  The Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership established at the initiative of Chinese and Russian leaders has promoted the comprehensive development of exchanges and cooperation in various fields between the two countries , advanced the movement toward a multipolar world , and enhanced the international standing of both countries .  
He said : Practice has proved that the establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is indeed a wise choice of historical significance [ li shi xing de zheng que jue ze 2980-0670-1840-4104-2973-4292-2115-2344 ] .  In the new millennium and the new century , the two sides should take a long view and become good neighbors , good partners , and good friends who trust each other , engage in cooperation , and pursue common development .  
Faced with an international and domestic situation that is undergoing profound changes and a glorious and arduous mission , the deputies will be thoroughly studying major issues of overall and strategic significance in reform , opening up and socialist modernization and will be reviewing important policies and arrangements for work in the coming year .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
Deputy Du Qinglin , secretary of the Hainan provincial CPC committee , said : Hainan 's industrial structural adjustment is based on , from a strategic viewpoint and bearing the overall situation in mind , making use of the resources for Hainan 's development , studying the market trend , deciding strategic industries to be developed , and bringing about industrial upgrading by making scientific and technological innovations .  In addition , through structural adjustment and linking the industries , we have effected new economic growth on an industrial base at a higher level .  
From now until the first 10 years of the next century , in order to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic system and maintain the continuous , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , we must solve major strategic problems that have comprehensive and long-term significance to economic development .  
speed up the development of new high-technology industries , particularly new industries of strategic significance ; and build them into the primary growth points for the capital 's economic development .  According to the requirements for basically materializing modernization ahead of others , the agricultural sector should introduce , grasp , and apply advanced technology to transform the traditional cropping industry , cultivate and develop new agricultural industries , make the peasants wealthier , and continue to strengthen and consolidate its role as the foundation of the national economy .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that positively pushing forward the strategic economic structural adjustment is a fundamental measure to give impetus to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy and elevate the quality and efficiency of the economic growth .  This is both a long-term mission and a pressing economic task of the moment .  
promote the national economy 's sustained , high-speed , and healthy development .  The expansion of domestic demand should be consistently combined with the expansion of exports ; the keeping of a rather quick economic growth rate should be combined with the strategic readjustment of the economic structure ;  
It was based on such thinking that Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the three-step strategic objective of our country 's modernization construction : from 1980 onwards , using 10 years to double gross national product so as to resolve the problem of food and clothing ;  
The content of the proposals is mainly : Maintaining sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , expanding domestic demand , promoting strategic economic restructuring , continuing to push ahead with reform and strengthening management , speeding up the development of science and technology and education , opening wider to the outside world , intensifying the building of a social security system , stepping up environmental protection , and strengthening the building of spiritual civilization and an honest and clean government .  
In the deliberation held by the Yunnan delegation , Deputy Pang Xijun maintains that this year is the final year for China to achieve the second stage of strategic objectives for socialist modernization in a comprehensive way , and the large-scale development of West China also provides the entire country with an opportunity for new economic development , which is unprecedented in history .  
At a time when we are about to finish the first two steps , the party 's leading collective of the third generation has made the third-step strategic goals more specific , drawn up a new program , and clearly defined the goals of the new " three-step " strategy .  This will help people throughout the country to maintain their fighting spirit and to firmly , steadily , and in a down-to-earth manner , stride toward the grand goal of building China into a modern socialist country .  
The deputies and committee members said : Development of the western region is a major strategic decision made by the party Central Committee facing the new century .  The decision will not only speed up development in the western region , narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions , and boost development of the entire national economy , but also will have a bearing on the achievement of the third-step development strategic goals .  
Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important speech at the plenary meeting of the PLA delegation enunciated the great historic mission shouldered by our Army in the new period from the lofty strategic point of view for achieving the grand objective of realizing our Army 's modernization , and set forth new requirements for comprehensive advancement of our Army 's building and reform .  
In other words , they attempt to bring developing countries to their strategic track and force developing countries to facilitate their hegemonist goal and to be their dependencies .  However , most developing countries have the bitter experience of being bullied and humiliated by Western big powers , thus they extremely treasure their national sovereignty and dignity and , of course , resolutely oppose and struggle against the so-called " human rights standard " and the " values " foisted on them by the current hegemonist powers .  
The strategic shift of the Party 's work focuses , the eventual affirmation of the basic line for the primary stage of socialism , the steady advancement of reform and opening up , and the gradual establishment of a system of socialist market economy have laid a firm but fully energetic and vigorous systematic basis for pushing forward the development of social productive forces and increasing the levels of the overall national strength and the material and cultural life of the masses of people .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
The establishment and development of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership is a historically correct choice and a sacred mission entrusted to us by the times .  It is in the fundamental interests of our two countries and our two peoples and helps promote the course of multipolarization in the world and establish a just and rational new international order .  
Wen Jiabao stressed : In the new period of economic development , to maintain the national economy 's sustained , high-speed , and healthy development , it is necessary to make strategic adjustment of the economic structure .  This will be a major task in our country 's economic work in the current and future periods .  
The strategic adjustment of the economic structure will give rise to huge investment and consumption demand .  This will not only provide a strong driving force for our nation 's economic growth , but will also provide broad market space for the development of domestic and foreign trade and economic exchanges .  
The Kosovo war initiated by the United States and other NATO countries did achieve the strategic objective of weakening the FRY , but it has also produced the effect of supporting and encouraging international terrorism and national splittist forces , throwing the world into greater disturbance .  Western countries will also have to eat their own bitter fruit .  
To meet the needs in speeding up the strategic adjustments of the economic structure , expanding domestic demand , promoting economic growth and social development , the party Central Committee and the State Council now took the tourist industry as a new growth point of the national economy , made great efforts to foster and support it , and set forth new requirements for the tourist industry under the new situation .  
The central leadership made the major policy decision on the great development of China 's west .  The national economy is undergoing strategic restructuring .  The state set forth a series of policies for expanding domestic demand and promoting economic growth .  
It is necessary to proceed on the basis of resolving currently prominent problems and to have in mind long-term development ; it is necessary to vigorously proceed with the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , to further stabilize and enhance agriculture 's position as the base , to intensify the adjustment of the industrial structure , and to accelerate the grand development of the western region , so as to improve the overall quality of the national economy and to raise the economy to a higher level .  
He said : The friendly cooperative relations between the two armies of Russia and China in the fields of national defense and military affairs have been developed on the basis of strategic cooperative partnership of good neighborliness and friendliness and mutual beneficial cooperation between the two countries .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
As a result , with the help of our troops in northern Manchuria , which attacked the enemy forces across the Linjiang three times , our troops in southern Manchuria successfully guarded Linjiang in four battles .  Subsequently , we successfully launched the spring and summer offensive and , as a result , our military situation in northeast China changed from strategic defense to strategic offense .  
We have persisted in implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the city on the strength of science and education , conscientiously placing education in the strategic position that gives top priority to educational development , and continuously increasing the financial input into education , so that a relatively complete educational system has been formed , and the 12-year education system has been made universal in the city five years ahead of schedule prescribed by the state .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
The 15th National Party Congress has formulated the strategic program of gearing the construction of a socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  The completion of this new historical task depends on the leading groups and the leading cadres at all levels , on the continuous upgrading of their leadership standard and government standard , and on the continuous strengthening of their ability to resist corruption and degeneration , and on their work to further solidify the party and the people , so that together we can struggle to move forward with our grand undertaking .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
After establishing " energy and transportation as key strategic points , " the late ' 80s and early ' 90s saw the inception of huge projects such as the Three Gorges Dam , the comprehensive hydro-power development of the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He River , accelerating development of western oil and central coal fields , and the extension of the Yanlonghai railway line as the " second continental bridge , " among other large-scale projects that concentrated funding in the west .  
At the beginning of 2000 , China 's national economy faced a new strategic mission , which was the structural adjustment of agriculture .  Many sharp contradictions exist among development and environmental protection , sustainable development and agricultural structural adjustment .  
In deciding on a strategic goal , we should try to meet our national security needs and comply with at once the needs of our national economic development and electronic information industry development and the needs of increasingly fierce competition on the domestic and international markets .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
Yu Yongbo said : From a overall-situation and strategic perspective , Chairman Jiang 's important speech scientifically analyzed the situation and tasks facing party building , elaborated in depth the extreme importance of enhancing the party 's governing and leading ability according to the requirements of the " three represents , " and laid down an important plan on completely advancing the new great project of party building .  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Chen Xiaojin : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , in accordance with a series of important instructions issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping , including " China-made vessels should fight into the international market , " China 's shipbuilding industry has adhered to export as its orientation ; has forged ahead with pioneering efforts ; has realized such a strategic transformation from " building vessels for military use in the main " to " turning vessels for military use into vessels for civil use and building vessels for civil use in the main " ;  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
Nevertheless , Taiwan , being a typical hilly island and surrounded by the sea , is narrow in space and lacks strategic depth .  Crowded with 23-million people , the 36,000 square kilometer island is absolutely unable to resist forced entry by a power .  At the moment , the Taiwan authorities are going against the historical trend .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
The large-scale development of the western region as a major strategic task of the party and the state is now placed in a salient position .  Xinjiang situated along the northwestern border of the country is an important part of large-scale development in the western region , which will have a bearing on the overall situation in economic development .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
Geopolitically , Taiwan is situated in the center of a chain of islands in the westernmost Pacific Rim . It is not only a critical point of China 's maritime traffic between the north and south , but also represents the strategic spot in the Western Pacific , and is extremely important to the strategic structure of the Asia-Pacific region .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
The new leader of the Taiwan authorities stressed that in its long-term development prospects , the Taiwan navy must have the strategic goals of being a " crack , small , and strong force " , meaning that it should advance in the following ways : First , it must focus its vision on the distant future and draw up as soon as possible its mid and long-term manpower building plans ;  
Since the end of the Cold War , in order to maintain its leading position as " the only superpower capable of lording it over " , the United States has gradually cultivated a global strategy such as " controlling two oceans and striking from both sides " in light of a new international strategic pattern .  
We should adjust the military 's logistical structure in a scientific manner based on the principle of being qualified , combination , and high efficiency , perfect the support system , strengthen mobile support forces , and enhance the strategic support function .  
To meet with the " limited " strategic missile defense task requirements , the US Defense Department 's Ballistic Missile Defense Bureau has made , in line with the mass production principle , unified arrangements for the research projects of the TMD and NMD systems under the BMD plan .  The ultimate purpose is to enable these defense systems to coordinate with each other in combined operations , to jointly deal with a series of threats , and to provide a " nearly seamless defense network for the United States and for its allies " .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
The meticulous strategic setup that the United States worked out in Russia 's neighboring countries was not only designed to squeeze Russia 's strategic space but also to set up in advance an effective strategic support platform to interfere in the Euro-Asian region affairs in future .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed up the global strategic issues into four characters , " east , west , south , and west " .  He also defined the " north-south issue " , which reflects the gap between rich and poor , as a " core issue " .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
For the various policies that the United States has adopted for the implementation of its national strategy , one distinct feature is that differences in ideologies and values are being used to serve specific strategic purposes ; and as it has turned out , the United States is practicing a double standard when evaluating human rights and social values .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
Not only does information industry have a decisive impact on the livelihood of the ordinary people in China today but also , more importantly , it has become an important indicator of China 's comprehensive national strength .  Moreover , it has been universally acknowledged as China 's strategic industry in its economic and social development in the next century .  
With the acceleration of the establishment of the modern enterprise system , the strategic readjustment of the national economy , and the successive introduction of major reform measures , such as changing debts into equity , mergers and reorganization , the vitality of state-owned enterprises increased significantly and the goal of getting enterprises out of their plight was basically attained .  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
In particular , we acted in line with urban defense operations , with all priority cities acting in line with their respective strategic status , to build a number of key projects such as mass concealed defense works and key strong points .  
seriously put into practice all the major strategic policy-decisions of the party Central Committee ; given wide publicity to the main melody of our time in line with the work arrangements made by the provincial party committee and the provincial government and in the light of Sichuan 's realistic conditions ; and have done a great deal of work and achieved sound work results in boosting both the economic development growth and an all-round social progress in our province .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
At present , the people throughout the province have a strong desire and high enthusiasm for making progress and speeding up economic and social development .  We ardently hope to seize the historic opportunity brought about by the state 's strategic decision on making the great development of the western areas to effective fast economic development .  
Therefore , we should understand the vital significance of structural adjustment from the strategic point of view , speed up the economic structural adjustment and upgrading , and cultivate and bring up the industries and products with strong competitive power .  Only in this way can we remain invincible in the increasingly vehement international competition in the 21st century .  
What warrants our special attention is that the " Proposal " for the first time oriented the " vigorous promotion of the national economy and universal application of information technologies in society " as a " strategic move to embrace the overall construction for modernization " , unequivocally proposing that the " information technology should contribute to industrialization , display its newly emerging superiority , and achieve leaping development in the social productive forces " .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
Commanders at all levels should effectively correct the erroneous trend of appreciating advanced weapons while neglecting backward ones , appreciating battle equipment while neglecting that used for logistic purposes , and appreciating hardware while neglecting software aspects of equipment .  They should , in light of the overall situation , make project plans from a broad and strategic perspective of balanced development and overall advancement .  
If the United States deploys NMD , this will mean that the currently fragile Russian-US strategic balance will be broken , that Russia 's nuclear deterrent force will " be rendered ineffective , " and that the previous Russian-US nuclear disarmament will turn to be a disguised move for doing away with Russia 's nuclear weapons .  
That Putin lost no time in putting forward his proposals before attending the informal meeting of APEC leaders on 15 November shows that Russia is ready to continue to greatly reduce and finally eliminate nuclear arms on the basis of maintaining strategic stability ; and using the forum of the unofficial meeting of APEC leaders to publicize Russia 's ideas was for the purpose of gaining further international support on this issue .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .  In the future , we will continue to work hard with the new administration in the United States to actively advance bilateral relations to make new improvements and new progress , based on the principles of the three Sino-U.S . aftertime , especially mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in one another 's internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit .  
Issuing and implementing the " armament regulation " will play a positive and important role in profoundly carrying out the strategic military principles in the new period , reinforcing the centralized leadership in the armament work , standardizing the operating mechanism in armament work and establishing and completing the legal system of armament work .  
Based on the overall strategic plan for national economic and social development for the new period , in the next five to 10 years the tourist industry should play a more vigorous role in promoting reform and opening-up , implementing the policy of expanding domestic demand , accelerating economic restructuring , and improving the people 's living standards .  
Second , it is positively implementing strategic adjustment of the economic structure , and it is doing all we can to achieve comprehensive advancement of tertiary industries in the direction of speeding up the development of modern service industries , powerfully developing high-tech industries , and positively moving modernization of agriculture forward .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
The pro-Taiwan forces in the United States , who have called themselves " the blue unit , " have also advanced quite a few political propositions marked by strong ideological colors , and this has undermined the US-China relations ' healthy development and has frequently contravened the US strategic interests as well .  
Now that China has constantly enhanced her national strength in an all-round way , generally speaking , the Sino-US relations are expected to move forward in spite of frequent friction , and out of considerations for its own strategic interests , the United States is also expected to carry on its arms sales to Taiwan within limited space only . 
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
In order to implement Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong army with science and technology and to fully mobilize enthusiasm and creativity of professional and technological cadres , with the approval of the Central Military Commission , the four general departments have jointly issued a circular on raising relevant treatment for some senior experts in our army as of this year .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
Technology innovation has become the main motive force driving world economic and social development and a strategic commanding point in international economic competition as well as competition in overall national strength .  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
In the past five years our army has completely fulfilled the strategic task of reducing its personnel by 500,000 , totally ceased all commercial activities of the armed forces and armed police , won great victory in the fight against floods in 1998 , organized with high standards the parade for the 50th anniversary of the PRC , defended national sovereignty , security , and the unity of the motherland , and preserved social stability , and thus provided a reliable guarantee for China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
According to the long-range goal put forth at the 15th Party Congress , our country will scale a new height in economic and social development during the 10th five-year period .  The goal is : Maintaining a relatively rapid development pace in the national economy , achieving notable results in strategic economic restructuring , and significantly improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth , thereby laying a strong foundation for the GDP in 2010 to double that of 2000 ;  
To ensure sustained development and realize the third step strategic objective for economic and social development , we should always stick to the established basic national policy and seriously handle the relations between economic construction on the one hand and population , resources , and environment on the other .  
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
Qian Qichen said : Not long ago , President Jiang Zemin and President Bush exchanged letters and reached an important understanding on the development of Sino-US relations .  This demonstrates the strategic vision of the leaders and reflects the wishes of common citizens .  It points out a way forward for the effort to carry on from the past and forge ahead into the future in Sino-US relations .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
The central authorities ' decision to carry out study and educational activities in rural areas throughout the country concerning the important thinking of the " three represents " is an important basic project to step up and improve the party 's leadership over rural work , to deepen rural reform , and boost rural economic and social development , as well as a strategic measure to step up the building of the work style of rural grass-roots cadres .  
The vast numbers of rural grass-roots cadres should practice a good work style and lead the broad masses of peasants to push ahead strategic adjustments of the agricultural and rural economic structures , and help peasants increase their incomes and live a happy life .  
Chi Haotian fully affirmed the achievements made by military units and armed police units in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
Currently people generally believe that information security and the task of keeping information confidential is no longer an issue of simply maintaining secrecy , let alone an issue of pure technology .  It is instead a major strategic topic that has to do with national security , economic development , social stability and the success and failure of military struggles .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
PRC vice premier Qian Qichen 's trip to the United States may have resulted in some mutual strategic understanding , and yielded some preliminary benefits , but at the same time , with the defection of PLA colonel Xu Junping and the blatant spy cases involving scholars traveling to the US , relations between the US and China have not been able to emerge from the shadows , and just now the possibility for worsening and more tense relations exists .  
This is a major strategic disposition made by the party Central Committee and the State Council in light of the grim situation in public order currently facing China . It embodies a strong desire of the broad masses of the people and represents the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
What integrated strategic operations basically means is the overall , multidimensional use in the air , ground , sea , space , and electromagnetic realms of the information warfare capabilities , long-range precision strike capabilities , and mobility of integrated units , creating a decisive posture involving complete space-time control of the battlefield and focused directly at the enemy 's center of gravity .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
The reason is : in a foreseeable period to come , there will be no major change in the international strategic structure , and there will be no major breakthrough in Sino-US relations .  The United States will not make substantive adjustment of its strategy against China . Taiwan 's status as a chessman in the global strategy of the United States will not be shaken , and Taiwan 's role as a counter will not be weakened .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
In the era of information warfare , qualified senior personnel will undoubtedly become strategic resources vital to a war 's outcome , and those standing at a " commanding height " as regards qualified personnel are bound to get the upper hand in winning a victory in a war . 
However , to meet the need of its strategic objective of becoming the sole superpower dominating the world , the United States is still stubbornly sticking to the Cold War mentality and regards it as a basic method for handling and resolving international issues .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
Intensifying coordination and cooperation and deepening the strategic partnership between China and Brazil is of vital significance to augmenting the strength of the developing countries as a whole and giving impetus to the establishment of a fair , rational new political and economic order in the world .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .  
We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
We must insist on putting the military economy in the context of the national economy and combining strategic logistical construction with local infrastructure construction .  In the construction of railroads , highway , airport , docks , telecommunications , pipelines , urban construction and other basic construction , we must take into consideration the military needs and make sure they can be taken care with little or no extra spending .  
It will soon be 100 days since Little Bush became US President , but the impression he has given observers at home and abroad is one that can not be considered as good - - one that he handles international affairs in an intransigent , conceited and obstinate manner , showing no strategic vision whatsoever .  
Fostering high-quality news talent must be a strategic mission , adopting powerful measures and concentrating our efforts to foster a large and renowned group of politically strong , professionally excellent , stylistically honest and strictly disciplined reporters , editors and translators .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
Most of the weapons tested were long-range attack weapons , underscoring the Taiwan military 's new " offshore decisive battle " strategic concept .  The exercise also stressed the combined tactical applications of new types of weapons , in order to test the tactics and the weapons ' technical performance and give full play to the overall combat capabilities of various types of weapons .  
During the visit , Shi Yunsheng also respectively met with Kelche , chief of staff the French armed forces ; Le Chiavez , the French defense minister 's foreign affairs adviser ; and others .  He visited the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , a La Fayette-class frigate equipped with guided missiles , and a strategic missile nuclear submarine - - which are the French Navy 's latest vessels , and France 's naval college .  
US President George W . Bush had made clear long before during his election campaign : China and the United States are not " strategic partners " but " strategic competitors . "  Soon after taking office , George W . Bush handled a mid-air collision incident involving a US reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese fighter plane by persisting in being unreasonable and acting shamelessly , which has fully laid bare his hegemonistic face and sent the Sino-US relations downhill by a large margin .  
To smoothly accomplish the Tenth Five-Year Plan , achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and basically realizing socialist modernization in the middle of this century is the glorious and arduous historic mission for the working class and the broad working masses in our country .  
Putin emphasized : President Jiang Zemin 's visit to Russia is a major event in Russian-Chinese relations this year ; and it has extremely important practical and historical significance .  I am very delighted to be able to have a thorough exchange of views with President Jiang on ways to continuously enrich and deepen the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries , and to promote and strengthen bilateral cooperation in world affairs in the coming century .  
4 ) From the strategic level of building armed forces with better overall quality , they have established a system for training noncommissioned officers - - a system that has different levels , educational systems , and forms of training for improving the troops ' combat effectiveness .  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
An important mission in warfare research is to study new rules for commanding war in light of changes in the form of warfare , with special emphasis on the way operational guidelines and strategic military operations are prepared and executed .  
It is essential that strategic studies cater to the objective requirements of future military struggles and involve planning for building up military strength , with special emphasis on putting forward overall requirements for promoting rapid progress in building up military strength .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
He stressed : We highly value the development of Sino-US ties .  We propose : Sino-US ties should be dealt with from a strategic and long-term perspective , and the differences between the two countries handled in a proper way .  China and the United States should maintain and develop healthy and stable bilateral ties based on the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the norms governing international ties so as to benefit the people of the two countries .  
If the NMD plan were implemented , it would shatter global strategic balance and stability , damage mutual trust and cooperation among the world 's great nations , hinder international efforts to reduce and halt the spread of armaments , and touch off a new arms race .  
In the past more than 100 days , it not only announced the withdrawal from the " Kyoto Protocol " aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas release , but also decided to break the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed before and deploy the national missile defense system that will break the global strategic stability .  
Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
the development of enterprises in the war industry will promote the development of the US economy ; the building of the super shield will guarantee the United States ' absolute security and offset the nuclear deterring capacity of other nuclear states and shake off the binding of the anti-missile treaty , thus leading to the establishment of a new world security system with the United States at the center .  All these factors were included in the strategic consideration of the United States .  
Guam is located in the southern extreme of the Pacific Ocean 's Mariana Island Chain . The strategic function Guam as a forward deployment and support base for the United State military is increasing by the day .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
Such achievements have made an important contribution to the successful implementation of " the 9th five-year " plan in our region and the basic realization of developmental goals established at the third Tibet Work Forum set forth by the central authorities .  They have also created favorable conditions for carrying out the strategic goal of a leap forward in economic and social development in our region during the new period .  
It is secondary whether the Sino-US " constructive strategic cooperative partnership " can be maintained .  However , it is very dangerous and unwise for the new US government to regard China as its imaginary enemy , to shift its strategic focus to Asia , even to attempt to team up with Russia to punish China , and to regard and use the issue of China 's eventual reunification as a card to obstruct China . Almost all the experts well-versed with China issues disagree with Bush Jr . '  
International security strategy experts analyzed : The space force that Russia is forming at an accelerated pace will be a strong arm and sharp weapon for Russia to deal with the " space warfare " of the 21st century and ensure national strategic security ; what is more , is a " powerful " move to counter the United States ' NMD .  
The US strategic adjustment is a new round of expansion under the conditions of the development of the political , economic , and military situation in the world and the necessary result of further consolidating the US position of being the sole superpower in the new century .  The defense group of the Bush administration has a strong color of " Cold War fighter " .  The essence of his " new pragmatism " is to use the strong power of the United States as basis to maximize its national interests .  
Local governments at all levels including their party committees and departments and the party organization at all levels in the military have made many effective contributions to the appropriate resettlement of demobilized military cadres and reform in that resettlement .  They have effectively ensured the smooth implementation of the Party Central Committee 's strategic decision to cut military forces by 500,000 , enhanced the construction of quality in the military , accelerated national economic development and strengthened the social stability as a whole .  
We should accurately determine and promptly adjust the stress of preventing job-related crimes according to the party and state 's major measures and strategic plans for reform and development in the period , the situation in the occurrence of cases and crimes , social hot spots , problems about which the masses complain strongly , and symptomatic and tendentious issues ; we should find the right places to penetrate and open a breach in work , open work fields , strengthen our initiative in work , and achieve better actual results .  
According to foreign reports , in order to realize this strategic objective , the Indian navy has already worked out an explicit plan : Around 2012 , Indian 's fighting force at sea will be formed by large and medium-sized more-advanced fighting vessels including three aircraft carriers and about 20 submarines with a total naval force of more than 100,000 troops .  
Since last year , Japan and India have constantly strengthened their cooperation in military and other fields , established a partnership relationship , conducted many joint military exercises , jointly cracked down on those pirates threatening Japan 's energy passage at sea , and weakened the strategic pressures brought about by China to Japan at sea . 
The third battle : Naval and air troops crossed beaches for landing .  Paratroops occupied strategic forts while naval and air troops and the Second Artillery Corps used strong firepower to support the attack and prevent foreign troops from eliminating mines , blocking seas , and entering the Taiwan region to join the remaining pro-Taiwan independence forces for military counterattacks .  
After comprehensively completing a project aimed at integrating an " air network " information system with a " ground network " information system , which is being relentlessly pursued by the US Government , the US strategic early warning system is expected to have plugged up all its loopholes , and by that time , the United States is likely to become the most perilous source of war in its capacity as the sole space-dominating power . 
Berger was Clinton 's military advisor on foreign affairs and security questions , and was a motivating force for the United States and China developing " relations of strategic partners " .  At present , he still insists that " based on the United States ' principles of democracy and national security , the government is obligated to continue to carry out policies to maintain contact with China in principle " .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
The strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has continued to deepen in the new century .  This not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples but also conducive to promoting the process of a multi-polar world and to building a new , just , and rational international political and economic order .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .  
For example , they are in favor of safeguarding and abiding by the 1992 " Anti-Ballistic Treaty " that forms the cornerstone for strategic stability and the foundation for the reduction of strategic offensive weapons , and are opposed to the deployment of closed theater missile defense systems by blocs of countries in the Asia-Pacific region .  They also support the initiative to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia , and support the efforts of and leading role played by the United Nations in the settlement of conflicts in Afghanistan and other issues .  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
Quite a few serving generals , and retired generals who have just left active service , maintained : Taiwan has to develop such weapons as medium-range missiles for the sake of strategic deterrent , even if such missiles are armed with no nuclear warheads .  They stated : The more the mainland economy develops , the more deterrent Taiwan 's medium-range missiles will have .  
Second , we should bring the role of universities and scientific research institutes into full play , make great efforts to carry out strategic advanced technology research and creative and basic research .  We should enhance our sustained innovation capability in science and technology .  We should strive to realize rapid development in technology in the domain that we have relative advantages or in the domain that is strategically important .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
The overall standard of living has already reached a well-off level and China now has a considerable group of wealthy people .  The objective for the second strategic step of socialist modernization has been realized in a general fashion .  
We must closely seize upon the excellent opportunity for strategic implementation of great western expansion and a stable social situation in Tibet , aim for prosperity , progress and long-term stability in Tibet , focus our energy on solving major issues concerning the overall development and stability of Tibet , promote Tibet 's economy from one marked by accelerating progress to one marked by leaps and bounds development , and promote Tibet 's social situation from one of basic stability to one of long-term stability .  
Now , we have adopted the basic economic system under which public ownership plays a dominant role in the national economy while other forms of ownership develop side by side .  We are shaping a socialist market economy and introducing strategic adjustments to the economic structure .  Consequently some workers have changed their jobs .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
For the first time , it gives a systematical reply to a series of basic questions concerning the development course of socialism , development stage of socialism , fundamental tasks of socialism , development driving forces , external conditions , political guarantees , strategic steps , the party 's leadership , the reliable forces , and the motherland 's reunification in China . It guides our party to formulate its basic line in the initial stage of socialism .  
requires that the entire party membership think of danger in times of peace and keep a stronger sense of crisis , guard against arrogance and rashness , continue to work hard for implementing the party 's basic line and fulfilling the party 's historical tasks .  Jiang Zemin 's speech shows a strategic foresight , provides profound ideas , gives theoretical guidance to many issues , and is another important programmatic document of our party to carry forward its cause into the future .  
and it was a programmatic document guiding us in the new millennium to comprehensively promote the party 's construction of grand new projects , and to comprehensively promote the grand cause of the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The troops throughout the entire military must thoroughly understand the vital significance of General Secretary Jiang 's speech , make studying and implementing the speech a significant political mission and a long term strategic mission , and lose no time in firmly grasping these missions .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
She said : During the visit , President Jiang Zemin and President Putin will exchange views on a wide-range of current major and pressing regional and international issues , in order to make concerted efforts to safeguard global strategic balance and stability .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
Second stage .  The three forces will cooperate in see crossing and landing operations , including simulated missile attacks , air assaults , night airborne raids , naval and ground forces occupying islands and launching sudden attacks , the special armed unit 's sudden attacks on ports or airports , and house-to-house fighting .  This reveals that the PLA 's island-attacking pattern has begun to change from " marine landings " into " airborne assaults . "  Under the new pattern , cracks troops rather than large numbers of troops will be sent to occupy important strategic points .  
For this reason , the United States began to reconsider China 's strength and ponder if its excessively radical policy to contain and isolate China had damaged US strategic interests and practical economic interests .  It is against this background that US Secretary of State Powell plans to visit Beijing in July and Bush is scheduled to visit China and meet with President Jiang Zemin in October , in a hope to establish constructive relations with China .  
Under the strategic plan of " a small change every year , a medium change every three years and a big change by the year 2010 " put forward by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee , Guangzhou has devoted great efforts to the development and comprehensive improvement of its urban environment in its endeavor to provide its people with a more comfortable living environment .  
The two parties will use and perfect the mechanism for holding periodic meetings at various levels , and first of all at the highest and high levels , to hold periodic exchanges of views and coordinate their stances on bilateral relations and major and urgent international issues of common concern , so as to strengthen their strategic cooperation partnership of trust as equals .  
They point out that the establishment of the strategic partnership marked by equality and trust was a correct historical choice , and it has decisive significance for strengthening cooperation between the People 's Republic of China and the Russian Federation in all areas , for consolidating friendship between the Chinese and Russian peoples , and for building a just and rational international new order .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
After the Cold War , Chinese and Russian leaders decided to establish a new type of interstate relationship based on the five principles for peaceful coexistence out of their respective strategic needs for national construction and their common desire to work for world peace and development .  
During the talks , the Chinese and Russian heads of state have earnestly reviewed the development of Sino-Russian ties over the past 10 years .  They pointed out : Establishing a strategic cooperative partnershipthat is equal and trusting is a correct historic choice , and has decisive impacts on the following : when China and Russia strive to comprehensively strengthen cooperation , when China and Russia strive to consolidate their peoples ' friendship , and when the world strives to establish a fair and rational new international order .  
Jiang Zemin said that several years ago , China and Russia declared the establishment of strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century in accordance with changes in the international situation and proceeding from the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .  
He added : This treaty is geared toward the future , the new century , and the next generation .  The principal spirit of the treaty expounded by President Jiang at the Moscow State University is of very special significance because the Russian-China good-neighborly and friendly cooperative relationship and strategic cooperative partnership should be carried forward and developed by the younger generation .  
The treaty lays down that the principles of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit , are the basic norms for the long-lasting and comprehensive development of the good neighborly friendship and cooperation and the strategic cooperation partnership of equality and mutual trust between the two countries .  
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1991 , President Jiang Zemin and Russia 's first President Yeltsin profoundly summed up the experiences and lessons of history ; based on the strategic requirements of their countries ' national construction and development , and in accordance with the new characteristics and trends of changes in the international situation , they decided to establish a new style of interstate relationship completely different from the cold war period .  
China and Russia will further strengthen strategic cooperation , together advance the world multipolarization process and the building of a democratic , fair , and rational new economic order , and work together to preserve world peace and promote joint development , This is the objective requirement of the current development of the international situation and is also the unshirkable major responsibility of the two countries .  
Rumsfeld has indicated on numerous occasions that , although Europe 's importance to the US remains unchanged , with the break up of the Soviet Union the military threat that the US faces in Europe has been greatly reduced , and the eastward expansion of NATO has also clearly increased NATO 's strategic depth , resulting in a great improvement in the security environment of the European allies , and at present the likelihood of war breaking out on the European continent is far less than in Asia .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
Ground-to-air missiles , aviation missiles , ship-to-ship missiles , anti-tank missiles , conventional missiles , offensive tactical missiles , strategic nuclear missiles , and continental strategic missiles moved through Tiananmen Square , and almost all the new missile types from China 's guided missile family made their appearances .  
It represents the contemporary advanced strategic culture and security idea , is a continuation and development in the new period of China 's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence , an extension and continuation in international security affairs of China 's new type of peace-loving and development-pursuing political idea , and the new manifestation in contemporary security affairs of China 's fine cultural tradition of regarding peace as the top priority , maintaining good neighborly and amicable relations with one 's neighbors , and maintaining peaceful and cooperative relations with all countries .  
In the new century , China and Japan should , on the basis of the spirit of " taking a warning from history and looking forward to the future " and the principle determined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement , Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship , and Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration , continue to hold the overall bilateral relationship from strategic and historical heights , eliminate disturbances , and overcome obstacles ; and to work hard to open up a new aspect of good neighborliness , friendship , and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
Through the sustained and rapid economic development over the last 20-plus years following the introduction of the reform and opening-up program , we fulfilled , ahead of schedule , the strategic task of quadrupling the 1980 GDP and per-capita GNP , proceeding from being adequately fed and clad to a comfortable life , which represents a historic leap .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Philosophy and social science workers must engage in theoretical studies in light of actual situations .  They should pay attention to studying those important issues that have a close bearing on the situation as a whole , issues that will appear in the future , and strategic issues so that theoretical , institutional , and scientific-technological innovations will proceed vigorously .  
On 7 and 8 August , the Russian military delegation headed by Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky , first deputy chief of Russia 's general staff , and the US military delegation headed by Douglas Feith , undersecretary of defense for policy , held a two-day meeting in the US Pentagon . At the end of the meeting , they issued a brief statement , saying that the delegations of the two countries held a " substantive discussion " on an extensive scope of issues concerning strategic stability and international security .  
While facing the overbearing offensive launched by the United States , to preserve its own national strategic and security interests , on the one hand , Russia insisted that the ABM Treaty could not be revised or abolished and indicated that if the United States deploys the national missile defense system , Russian will take corresponding countermeasures , including increasing the quantity of nuclear warheads , and even threatened to scrap other concluded treaties on reducing nuclear weapons ;  
This treaty makes long-term plans for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century , and in particular lays down that the two parties will enduringly and comprehensively develop a strategic cooperation partnership of good neighborliness , friendship , cooperation , and trust as equals .  This treaty expresses in concentrated form the broad common interests of the two countries in bilateral relations and international affairs .  The treaty does away with the cold war mentality that interstate relations are either alliance or confrontation ;

The treaty does away with the cold war mentality that interstate relations are either alliance or confrontation ;  
Second , we should actively promote the research of high technologies of strategic significance , and launch major and important engineering projects using new and high technologies .  To bring about a leap forward in the development of productive forces in our country , we should keep abreast of the new development trend of the world 's high technologies and related industries ; intensify our strategic studies of high technologies in such key fields as information technology , biological technology , new material technology , advanced manufacturing and automation technology , and marine technology ;  
Zhu Rongji emphasized that speeding up the perfection of the social security system is the urgent requirement of preserving social stability and consolidating and developing the current good development momentum , and is also a strategic move for achieving lasting political stability .  
As Bush said that he regarded China as a " strategic competitor " during his election campaign , Henry Kissinger pointed out : Bush 's viewpoint is just an " immature expression aimed at pleasing the conservatives and the hard-liners in the Republican Party . " A noticeable fact is that inside US political circles , there exists a hawkish camp and a dovish camp , and the influence of the two camps may change along with the changes in the domestic politics .  
Logistics support must be adapted to such circumstances in order to meet the need of frequent level changes in a joint operation .  This calls for a system in which the organs are streamlined , levels reduced , functions clearly defined , and relationship smooth so as to realize an integral operation from strategic logistics to tactical logistics .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .  
Thanks to the establishment and improvement in the socialist market economy , the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , and the diversification of the forms of public ownership and the rapid development of other non-public sectors since the implementation of the revised Trade Union Law , profound changes have been effected in economic and labor exchanges .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
The key part of the exercise is beach landing , which includes topics of anti-landing , air raids and anti-air raids , parachuting , electronic jamming and anti-jamming , satellite surveillance and tracking , blockading and anti-blockading , attacking with tactical and strategic missiles , hitting aircraft carriers , hitting invisible aircraft , hitting cruise missiles , hitting helicopters , anti-precision attacks , anti-surveillance and anti-monitoring , and so on .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
The primary force driving Sino-US relations forward is that there are enormous common interests between the two sides on both national and global strategic issues and that these interests far outweigh the differences and contradictions between them .  
Zhang Deguang said , as a result of more than 10 years of accumulated experience , China and Russia have built a whole set of effective mechanisms for developing good neighborliness , friendship , and strategic coordination , from the periodic meetings of their heads of state and heads of government to bilateral direct contacts between counterpart departments .  These mechanisms involve various fields such as politics , economics , and science and technology , and they are being more and more perfected and standardized .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
Agricultural Minister Chen Yaobang maintained that the time is ripe for China to carry out strategic adjustments for agriculture and the rural economy .  He said the agricultural restructuring will be market-oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .  
The surface warship unit represents a backbone force of the Chinese Navy in carrying out defense strategic task on coastal waters .  It is also the earliest branch established by the Navy . The Chinese Navy has expanded its surface warship unit .  Now it has guided missile destroyers , guided missile escort ships , and guided missile boats as its major fighting capacity .  
The spokesman said : Attempts , plans , and actions by a single country to seek military and strategic advantages in outer space not only have always existed but are being further developed .  If this is not prohibited , it is likely that weapons will be employed in outer space in the near future , which could even lead to a multilateral arms race in outer space .  
China 's entry into WTO will certainly promote China 's link with the world economy and strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in making investment in China . It will create a more stable outside environment for China 's economic development and help China realize the strategic goal of a sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .  
Reform will continue to take the institution of a modern enterprise system and operational mechanism suited to the requirements for the market economy as a center , so as to quicken the pace of enterprises ' strategic reorganization , speed up the reform of a standardized company system , and develop a coordinated specialized and socialized system .  
Under the pretext of the so-called " China threat theory , " some foreign forces have also seized opportunities to intervene in the Taiwan question , an act of interference in China 's internal affairs , through diverse means such as , in the military sphere , continuing arms sales to Taiwan and building " theater missile defense , " in an attempt to secure their strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region through the continued playing of the " Taiwan card , " thereby presenting a threat to our national security .  
On 12 February , Renmin Ribao carried a commentator 's article entitled " All Members of Society Should Concern Themselves With and Give Support to Education Undertakings . " The article discussed the situation from the strategic high plane of national destiny and reinvigoration .  It said that correctly guiding young students and helping them grow up healthy and sound and enabling them to develop in an all-round way - - morally , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically - - is a major issue that has a bearing on the direction of China 's education development .  
It is necessary to pay close attention to the realization of strategic adjustment of the economic structure in our country through technological progress and innovations , and to the implementation of the strategy of " making China known to the outside world , " as well as to the establishment and improvement of a complete set of systems and mechanisms needed for developing the socialist market economy .  
On the frequent high-level meetings between China and Russia , Zhu Bangzao said : The strategic cooperative partnership that is continuing to develop between China and Russia is based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the universally recognized norms of international law ; it is a new type of state-to-state relationship that is characterized by non-alignment and non-confrontation and is not targeted at a third country .  
Pan held that one can clearly see from " The Chinese Army Marching towards the 21st Century , " namely , the first part of a special television series entitled " The Chinese Army " aired by CCTV [ China Central Television ] : In the process of cross-century development , viewed from the overall strategic interests of national security and development , the Chinese Army 's modernization building must be accelerated , this being of great significance to PLA performing its functions and fulfilling its task of defending the homeland and the state in the future . 
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
Addressing a group discussion held by the Inner Mongolia delegation on the afternoon of 5 March , Buhe , vice chairman of the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee , said : Premier Zhu Rongji 's government work report stressed the strategy of actively developing west China and the issues of expeditiously developing central and west China . This is an important and very popular policy decision .  It has a strategic significance whereby if we can properly accomplish this task , other regions will also be invigorated .  
" this year 's government work has the significance of taking over from the past and setting a new course for the future " ; the country 's strategic readjustment " should not only aim at settling current prominent problems , but should all the more set its eyes on long-term development " ; and that the 10th Five-Year Plan , which is to be formulated this year , " has a great bearing on China 's overall economic and social development during the early years of the 21st century . "  
When studying the development strategy and ideas oriented to the 21st century , we must consider the software industry as a strategic industry of the state , formulate a package of supporting policies and preferential measures , and set up a mechanism for attracting and stabilizing outstanding persons with software talents .  Meanwhile , we should rely on markets to develop the risk-running investment industry ; encourage large enterprises , institutions of higher learning , and scientific research institutes to invest in development of software ;  
How to make plans for technological renovation , the strategic development of high technology , and the realization of the industrialization of higher technology are of extremely great significance to promoting the revitalization of the country with science and education , increasing China 's comprehensive national strength and international competitiveness , and promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .  
With SOEs facing so many problems , the current problems that affect the overall order have a far-reaching impact , and must be solved are the strategic adjustment of our state-owned economy and the corporate-upgrading reform of SOEs These are two basic problems for intensifying SOE reform and fully stimulating the growth potential of our national economy . 
Since his assuming the post of the chairman of the government in September last year and becoming the acting president at the end of December , Putin has repeatedly expressed that he will persist in developing and deepening the Sino-Russia strategic partnership of cooperation [ zhong e zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi 0022 0192 2096 3970 0588 0155 0129 0133 7070 0190 ] and will consider Sino-Russian relations as the cornerstone of Russian foreign affairs .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !

On the frequent high-level meetings between China and Russia , Zhu Bangzao said : The strategic cooperative partnership that is continuing to develop between China and Russia is based on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and the universally recognized norms of international law ; it is a new type of state-to-state relationship that is characterized by non-alignment and non-confrontation and is not targeted at a third country .  
Pan held that one can clearly see from " The Chinese Army Marching towards the 21st Century , " namely , the first part of a special television series entitled " The Chinese Army " aired by CCTV [ China Central Television ] : In the process of cross-century development , viewed from the overall strategic interests of national security and development , the Chinese Army 's modernization building must be accelerated , this being of great significance to PLA performing its functions and fulfilling its task of defending the homeland and the state in the future . 
regard raising the scientific and technological quality of military personnel as an important strategic task ; work hard to train qualified cross-century hi-tech personnel ; implement in real earnest Chairman Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " rather letting qualified personnel wait for equipment than letting equipment wait for qualified personnel , " and put scientific and technological quality progress of qualified personnel in a prominent position in the Chinese army 's modernization building .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
Addressing a group discussion held by the Inner Mongolia delegation on the afternoon of 5 March , Buhe , vice chairman of the National People 's Congress [ NPC ] Standing Committee , said : Premier Zhu Rongji 's government work report stressed the strategy of actively developing west China and the issues of expeditiously developing central and west China . This is an important and very popular policy decision .  It has a strategic significance whereby if we can properly accomplish this task , other regions will also be invigorated .  
" this year 's government work has the significance of taking over from the past and setting a new course for the future " ; the country 's strategic readjustment " should not only aim at settling current prominent problems , but should all the more set its eyes on long-term development " ; and that the 10th Five-Year Plan , which is to be formulated this year , " has a great bearing on China 's overall economic and social development during the early years of the 21st century . "  
When studying the development strategy and ideas oriented to the 21st century , we must consider the software industry as a strategic industry of the state , formulate a package of supporting policies and preferential measures , and set up a mechanism for attracting and stabilizing outstanding persons with software talents .  Meanwhile , we should rely on markets to develop the risk-running investment industry ; encourage large enterprises , institutions of higher learning , and scientific research institutes to invest in development of software ;  
How to make plans for technological renovation , the strategic development of high technology , and the realization of the industrialization of higher technology are of extremely great significance to promoting the revitalization of the country with science and education , increasing China 's comprehensive national strength and international competitiveness , and promoting the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
At the same time , he also proposed that departments concerned should re-appraise the reasonability and serviceability of the existing national defense engineering system in southeast coastal areas based on the Central Military Commission 's military strategic principle for the new period , should rebuild this system in line with the requirements of the future high-tech war , and should intensify the building of military facilities and future battlefields in order to meet the demands of the military struggles against Taiwan .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
The top level in Beijing believes that peaceful reunification must be guaranteed by powerful military force and correct strategic design , otherwise , the initiative in cross-strait relations will be lost .  
With SOEs facing so many problems , the current problems that affect the overall order have a far-reaching impact , and must be solved are the strategic adjustment of our state-owned economy and the corporate-upgrading reform of SOEs These are two basic problems for intensifying SOE reform and fully stimulating the growth potential of our national economy . 
Since his assuming the post of the chairman of the government in September last year and becoming the acting president at the end of December , Putin has repeatedly expressed that he will persist in developing and deepening the Sino-Russia strategic partnership of cooperation [ zhong e zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi 0022 0192 2096 3970 0588 0155 0129 0133 7070 0190 ] and will consider Sino-Russian relations as the cornerstone of Russian foreign affairs .  
As the coming decade is the critical period for China in marching toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , the establishment of a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the maintenance of the sustained , rapid , and healthy growth of the national economy are two major issues that must be properly solved .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .  
In order to achieve its strategic intention of building a " US unipolar world , " the United States aims to possess the world 's most advanced conventional and nuclear weapons and to maintain the world 's most powerful conventional and nuclear arsenal and to comprehensively raise its technical superiority , in a bid to ensure its " overwhelmingly superior dominant status in every kind of conflict " and " successfully fight two major theater wars that occur almost simultaneously . "  
In fact , the United States has never intended to make Taiwan an " independent " country in the true sense of the word .  Taiwan is a mere pawn on the US strategic chessboard and an " unsinkable aircraft carrier " deployed in the Far East Pacific region by the United States . Whether the United States will retain or abandon this pawn is determined not by its consideration of Taiwan people 's interests but solely by the consideration of its own national interests .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
In recent years , the National Defense Committees at all levels of the military region have conscientiously implemented the gist of relevant instructions issued by the party Central Committee , the State Council , the Central Military Commission , and the State National Defense Committee ; persistently regarded the military strategic principle of the new period as their general guidance , deepened reform , paid close attention to a sound implementation , and have attained evident results in their national defense mobilization building .  
China 's banking industry should accelerate its pace of transforming operational mechanisms , bring about banking system upgrading , open up new business spheres , elevate its managerial level in a comprehensive way , open the financial sector wider to the outside world , maintain the state 's financial security , and facilitate the strategic adjustment of the national economic structure and the change of economic growth pattern .  
President Putin of Russia and visiting President Clinton of the United States held talks on such issues as global strategic stability at the Kremlin on 4 June . The joint communiqu on principles of strategic stability signed by the two sides pointed out that the presidents of the two countries would work hard to strengthen strategic stability and international security and declared that in the future there would be further discussions on further reductions in the two countries strategic forces within the START III framework and continued consultations on the antiballistic missile issue .  
Deng Xiaoping first readjusted the past practice of using the social system and ideology as a line of demarcation and advocated proceeding from the national strategic interests in handling state-to-state relations , transcending the similarities and differences in social systems and ideology , giving no thought to historical resentment , refraining from engaging in ideological disputes , and developing relations with all countries in accordance with the norms of international relations .  
We are confident in and capable of maintaining the momentum of development of the national economy and various social undertakings , and we will be striving to fulfill the third-stage strategic goal as defined by Deng Xiaoping , that is , to build China into a moderately developed country by the middle of the 21st century .  
It is reported that the state has taken the development of forestry in the western region as another strategic priority to the forestry construction .  The State Forest Bureau plans to invest 100 billion yuan in the next 10 years to develop afforestation along the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and the upper and middle reaches of Huang He . Meanwhile , effective measures will be taken to plant trees in closed hillsides and to return cultivated areas into forests in an effort to bring desertification under control .  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
The strategic partnership established between China and the United States in the 1980 ' s has long since ceased to exist .  The 1989 Tiananmen incident and the US media 's consistently negative reports on China have made the US people even more hostile to the CPC-led government .  This has left an irreparable crack in Sino-US relations to a great extent , and created the soil and environment for the consistently anti-China rightwing conservative forces of the United States to attack and block China .  
Implementing the great development of the west and speeding up the development of central and west China will open new and broader scope for China 's economic development in the 21st century ; it is a major strategic measure for maintaining China 's sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development and is of great significance for the country 's prosperity and long-lasting stability .  
Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .  
The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations in mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan held a meeting with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in the Diaoyutai Guesthouse today .  The two sides stated that they will continue to work together toward the goal set by the two heads of state on building a Sino-US constructive strategic partnership , and will carry out all the preparatory work for the two heads of state to meet during the millennial UN summit meeting and the informal APEC summit .  
At present Sino-US relations are facing new opportunities .  The most fundamental thing for maintaining the momentum of healthy and steady development of Sino-US relations is to firmly grasp the overall situation in their relationship and the common interests of their peoples , persist in handling their bilateral relations from the strategic level and from the long-term angle , and in particular , adhere to the basic norms of international relations of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , equality and mutual benefit , and mutual noninterference in internal affairs .  
It is not the product of wishful thinking that China and the United States should work for establishing a " constructive strategic partnership . "  It is based on their common needs .  It helps the governments of the two countries to grasp the major orientation in developing bilateral relations .  
We should build a corps of high-quality cadres who should be politically firm and who are able to cope with all kinds of dangers and are skillful in dealing with complicated situations .  All these are for the purpose of enabling our party to meet challenges , grasp the opportunity , gain the initiative , bring about development , and gain a favorable strategic position in the 21st century .  
When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
Qian Qichen pointed out : During our talks with Albright , we stressed that whether Sino-US relations can be improved and developed and whether China and the United States can establish their constructive strategic partnership is determined by whether the United States follows the basic norms governing the international law of respecting other countries ' state sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrains from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs and truly sticks to the " one China " principle in its acts .  
The new middle-of-the-road line is a complete " Taiwan independence " theory and strategic program , its core idea is the so-called " democracy and human rights , " and its ultimate purpose and actual intention are to avert the debate over reunification and independence , solidify the foundation and strength for the " Taiwan independent " mindset , and comprehensively counter the one China principle with a new form and scale .  It is in reality a vicious conspiracy of de facto " Taiwan independence . "  
and that a US military strategic chain link from Japan in the north to Australia in the south be established and targeted on China . Taiwan is located in the central and crucial position in this military strategic chain link of the United States .  
In answering the question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held by the Foreign Ministry today , Sun Yuxi said that China thinks the missile defense plan announced by the United States is not in keeping with the trend of the times , is harmful to the international efforts dedicated to arms control and disarmament , and will produce a harmful impact on global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
Speaking of the central financial expenditure in 1999 in terms of both allocation and use , Xiang stated : Our central financial expenditure has conscientiously implemented and carried out both the strategic arrangements laid down by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision made by the Second Session of the Ninth NPC and has played a positive role in promoting sustained , rapid , or healthy national economic development ; in pressing ahead with a deep-going reform in the state-owned enterprises ; in attaining the goal of shaking off poverty ;  
Regarding the arrangement for , and use of , the central fiscal expenditure , Xiang Huaicheng said : In the area of central fiscal expenditure , we have conscientiously implemented the strategic plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision of the second session of the Ninth NPC .  It has played a positive role in such areas as promoting the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy ; helping state enterprises intensify their reforms ;  
He believes : If the plan for star wars is approved , the consequences of global arms race will be very serious : It will undermine existing international agreements on arms and on destruction of nuclear weapons , including international treaties banning nuclear tests , treaties on reducing strategic weapons , and agreements on controlling and stopping nuclear weapons .  
The meeting maintained that the Central Ideological and Political Work Meeting is an important meeting held at the historic moment of our party in its advance toward the new century , and also a major move of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core which adheres to the strategic principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both " for promoting the cause of reform , opening up , and modernization in a comprehensive way .  
Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
In deploying this strategic plan , the western region must clearly understand and grasp the international and domestic economic situations , take the changing situations into consideration , adopt the appropriate measures to push their economic work forward , and use expanded opening up to give impetus to development .  
At today 's news conference held by the Foreign Ministry , Sun Yuxi , while answering a reporter 's question regarding the failure of the US missile interception test , said : The US development of the NMD system will break the global strategic equilibrium and stability , hinder the nuclear disarmament process , spoil the efforts of the international community on non-proliferation , and may trigger off another round of the arms race .  This is against the interests of all nations across the world , including the United States itself .  
Igor Rogachev said : " The development of strategic cooperative partnership with China is a fundamental principle in Russia 's foreign policy .  The principle can not be altered and has won support from major social and political power in Russia . "  
People are convinced that , under the direct push by the leaders of the two countries and with joint efforts of both sides , the strategic cooperation partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] between China and Russia will certainly be further strengthened , and the economic cooperation between the two countries will continue to develop in a stable manner .  
Reportedly , Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will have a separate meeting with his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian tomorrow afternoon.An authoritative figure here disclosed that the political topic of Putin 's visit to China would mainly involve international strategic security , anti-missile , and regional hot issues .  In addition , Putin 's visit to China is regarded as informing the Chinese side of Russia 's position at the G-8 Summit and relevant matters .  
The 1972 " Treaty on Restricting the Antiballistic Missile System " ( hereafter called the " ABM Treaty " for short ) still remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security and is the basis of key international agreements on reducing and restricting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao solemnly stated when briefing today on the Sino-Russian joint statement on the ABM issue that China and Russia both oppose the National Missile Defense [ NMD ] system , and appealed to the international community to continue to show serious concern regarding those countries which are vigorously developing ABM defensive systems that undermine global strategic balance and stability , and also take the necessary steps to prevent the development of this dangerous trend .  
He said , in this joint statement the two sides emphasize that the 1972 " Treaty on Limiting ABM Systems " remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security , and is the basis of key international agreements reducing and limiting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
However , Putin 's China visit itself and his recent series of speeches on the policy toward China have clearly proven that the current Russian Government has not diminished its attention to Asia , and that it has fully affirmed and highly valued the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation , regarded China as Russia 's most important cooperative partner , and considered Sino-Russian relations the area Russia should develop on a priority basis in implementing its foreign policy .  
When receiving visiting US Secretary of Defense Cohen in Beijing recently , President Jiang Zemin spoke with him in a grave tone and with sincerity : The Chinese and US Governments and leaders should look far ahead from a high ground , be oriented to the future , grasp the general direction of Sino-US relations from a strategic height and long-term angle , and properly handle Sino-US relations on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and in the spirit of mutual respect , equality , mutual benefit , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
While inspecting the Urumqi-Kuitun Freeway , Ismail Amat pointed out : By standing high , seeing far , and facing up to a new century , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has made such a wise decision as to implement a strategy of developing the western regions on a large scale , this being also a strategic arrangement made by the central authorities for speeding up the development of the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities .  
strive to research and find answers for new and major strategic issues on the party and national development and major ideological and theoretical issues in practical life the cadres and people are concerned about ; bring into full play the basic role of theory in ideological and theoretical work ; and bring about theoretical progress in promoting social development and realize the value of theory in satisfying the people 's needs .  
According to incomplete statistics , at present , the China strategic guided missile troop already has more than 200 mentors with doctorate or master degrees .  Those academics from the department of engineering , a large group of national class experts , and people who are treated with special allowance by the government are emerging .  
The development of the NMD and the TMD is bound to undermine global strategic balance , lead to a new round of arms race , and produce broad , far-reaching negative impact on international peace and security , on the process of international arms control and disarmament , and on the international non-proliferation efforts .  Such developments are compromising the regional confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the regional security .  
During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov , Tang Jiaxuan said the Chinese side attaches importance to developing its strategic cooperative partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] with Russia . He spoke positively of President Putin 's recent successful visit to China and held the view that , to promote their bilateral relations , it is highly imperative for the leaders of the two countries to maintain and strengthen contacts .  
Moreover , the main direction of reform and development of state enterprises will continue to be : Introducing a standardized company system reform , bringing about diversification of enterprise investment , deepening reform of enterprise labor , personnel , and distribution systems , exploring an effective means for the management of state assets , accelerating readjustment of the economic structure , implementing strategic reorganization of enterprises , earnestly alleviating the debt burden of enterprises , and constantly improving the management level of enterprises .  
President Chen Shui-bian 's [ Chen Shui-bien 's ] idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " has not been mentioned in the report .  However , Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen emphasized in the foreword that the change of the strategic idea of the national troops to " effective deterrence and strong entrenchment " does not mean we are having an arms race with the Chinese communist troops .  
During a 16 June military review , the new leader in Taiwan put forward for the first time the strategic thinking of " fighting decisive battle outside Taiwan . " He also instructed the military to enhance its information warfare capability , develop air-to-ground missiles and other offensive weaponry , set up a special agency for the development of " space weapon system , " deploy for the first time guided missile boats to the Kinmen front , and conduct live-warhead missile launching exercise .  
It is a new form of military training adapted to the science and technology age and designed to win victory in a local war under high-tech conditions .  The mainland 's development of strategic ballistic missiles is in the direction of raising mobility , precision and warhead efficiency ; its development of tactical missiles is in the direction of increasing range , enhancing precision , raising payload and improving warhead efficiency ;  
Taiwan 's " Minister of National Defense " Wu Shih-wen said in the preface of the report : " The change of our strategic concept to effective deterrence and tenacious defense does not mean we want to engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists , " and " we hope we can proceed in an orderly way and step by step to promote the establishment of an institutionalized military mutual trust mechanism between the two sides to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Carrying out comprehensive institutional reform is a strategic task set by the 15th CPC Congress , is urgently required by the establishment of a socialist market economic system , and is an important part of political system reform .  
Focusing on fighting a sea-crossing and landing combat , various units of the war theater carried out operations of storming strategic passes , reconnaissance across the sea , unloading of heavy equipment , comprehensive smashing of obstacles at waterfronts and beachheads , coordinated combat by various arms , and anti-blockade at sea , thus scoring glorious combat achievements and producing outstanding results .  
He said : The splendid speeches and technological exchanges made by domestic and international renowned scholars and entrepreneurs at the forum will definitely exert important and far-reaching impacts on the strategic choices by government departments and on the survival and development of enterprises in the general trends in the 21st century where information technologies incorporate and industries facilitate a coordinated development .  
At the same time , he chaired a CIS summit and visited six CIS countries .  He settled the debt , gas shipment , common border defense issues with the countries concerned and , using security and energy cooperation as cohesive power , improved Russia 's leading role in the CIS . This has further solidified Russia 's security in the adjacent region and its strategic buffer zone .  
During his visit to China last July , Putin said that further developing all-round cooperation in the economic , trade , science and technology , and military fields is one of the important direction for expanding and deepening the equal , trustworthy , strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia .  
Putin 's diplomatic maneuvering of the last several months shows that in his foreign policy , he has a long-term strategic goal as well as strong consideration of the reality .  His overall foreign policy goal is defined as " ensuring national security " and " developing a good external environment for economic growth " to revitalize Russia .  
During recent years , our military 's armored force has deeply implemented the military strategic principle of the new period , established its footing on winning a victory in the local war under high-technology conditions , striven to upgrade quality , and steadily marched toward the goal of building itself into a picked , composite and efficient force .  
He expressed the hope that scientific and research personnel in general would further emancipate their thinking , intensifying reforms , enhancing their science and technology innovations in prospective , basic , and strategic areas , intensifying their efforts to do a good job of attracting , training , and employing outstanding talent , concentrating their efforts on the promotion of independent innovation , and doing an even better job in the intellectual innovation pilot project .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : To actively promote a strategic restructuring of the economy , achieve the two fundamental changes and maintain a sustained , rapid and healthy economic development will be the main tasks of our economic development at the beginning of the new century .  
Their struggle would also bring endless disasters to humankind .  If , on the other hand , these two poles become true " constructive strategic partners " and join hands in safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world with concerted efforts , the 21st century will have lasting peace and become the most peaceful century in modern history .  This will be the two countries ' greatest contributions to all humankind .  
Later he headed troops to give strategic chase to Kuomintang troops , liberating eastern China and many coastal islands .  After the founding of the New China , Comrade Su Yu was successively appointed deputy chief and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] .  Proceeding from the actual conditions of the army and state and the international environment , he made many major proposals to the CMC , making important contributions to building a modern defense and army .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
At the same time , the acceleration in the process of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization will provide good business development opportunities to foreign investors mainly in the following aspects .  First , China 's continued efforts to implement the principle and policy of expanding its domestic demand , and to accelerate strategic economic restructuring , will provide extensive space for foreign investments in agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , communications , raw and semi-finished materials , environmental protection , high technology , major equipment , and other fields .  
China will greatly promote the strategic readjustment of its economic structure , accelerate the computerization of the national economic and social sectors , greatly develop science , education , and cultural undertakings , step up developing such new and high technologies like information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , and advanced manufacturing technology , further step up infrastructure building in water conservancy , communications , and energy , and intensify efforts on ecological building and environmental protection .  
In their speeches , they stressed the need to unify thinking with central strategic policy decisions and to be more aware of politics , the overall situation , and responsibility .  In line with the unified arrangement of the party Central Committee and the State Council , we should conscientiously make plans , work in a down-to-earth manner , avoid practicing formalism , and realistically do a good job of guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativeness of the broad masses of the cadres and the people .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that at their meeting on the sidelines of the UN Millennium Summit not long ago , President Castro and President Jiang Zemin put forward a conception for the further development of bilateral relations from a strategic viewpoint , thus giving a strong push for the continuous development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries on a new level in the new century .  
He has demanded that the Taiwan armed forces establish the strategic idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and develop offensive weapons such as air-to-ground missiles , based on the notion of " repelling the enemy on the opposite shore " ; and for the first time Jinmen was included in the " Wan An exercise " on 16 August .  
He has demanded that the Taiwan armed forces establish the strategic idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and develop offensive weapons such as air-to-ground missiles , based on the notion of " repelling the enemy on the opposite shore " ; and for the first time Jinmen was included in the " Wan An exercise " on 16 August .  
He said : Russia and China 's decision to establish a strategic cooperative partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] has been a historic and correct one in the interest of both countries .  It is conducive to regional and global peace and stability as well as to progress towards a multi-polar world .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .  
At this critical juncture , when China is moving from the 20th century toward the 21st century , we must make material progress and cultural and ideological progress a uniform goal to strive for , unfailingly insisting on concentrating on both aspects .  We must put comprehensive social development in a strategic position , achieving the mutually-coordinated and sustainable development of the economy and society .  
Under the wise decision-making of the Party Central Committee , in the midst of a complex and ever-changing international situation , we have further established and unified a series of important national strategic relations , improving China 's international status .  
It was precisely at this extraordinary time and in a domestic and foreign environment of unprecedented complexity that , by relying on the concerted efforts of the entire people to overcome various difficulties , we still accomplished the " 9th Five-Year " plan successfully , ensuring the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the national economy and comprehensively accomplishing the second strategic step in the drive to modernization .  
The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting a few days ago to conscientiously study the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech on the grand western development , stressing that the propaganda , ideological , and cultural fronts should resolutely carry out the strategic arrangements of the central authorities , show concern for the grand development , conduct propaganda on the grand development , give support to the grand development , stress political awareness , concentrate energies on implementation , bring real drive into full play , and do practical things for the grand western development .  
The foreign ministers of the two countries spoken highly of the bilateral relations between China and Brazil ; and pledged to make further efforts to strengthen the cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , and scientific and technological fields , especially in the field of high technologies , to step up coordination and cooperation in international affairs , and to constantly enrich the contents of the strategic partnership between the two countries .  
He pointed out that the fact that Comrade Jiang Zemin had repeatedly emphasized the utmost importance of strengthening party building and the development of personnel of high caliber fully shows that whether in ensuring that socialist cause started by proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation can continue from generation to generation , in ensuring the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country , or in fulfilling the " three-step " strategic objective of socialist modernization , the key lies in the party and in qualified people .  
He said that in order to replace direct and specific management with macroscopic and strategic guidance , the important thing is to create a fine policy and legal environment for the healthy growth and functioning of professional and technical personnel and to establish and perfect a mechanism which allows outstanding personnel to excel .  
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
In 1997 , at the 15th CPC National Congress , Chairman Jiang Zemin declared to the whole world : Following the 1-million personnel retrenchment in the 1980s , China will further cut down the personnel size of its army by 500,000 in the next three years .  In order to implement this strategic decision made by Chairman Jiang and the party Central Committee , the PLA has readjusted the organizational establishment of its troops ; reformed its logistic support , weaponry management , and the structure of its military academies and training institutions ;  
In order to maintain the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the economy and to continue to improve the lives of more than 1.2 billion people , we must make some strategic adjustments of the economic structure , vigorously promoting reforms and opening up and innovations in science and technology , achieving an overall improvement in the quality of the national economy .  
In accordance with the long-term objective put forward at the 15th CPC National Congress , the major goal for the economic and social development of our country in the 10th Five-Year Plan period is : to maintain a relatively rapid speed in the development of the national economy , to obtain notable results in the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , to remarkably improve the quality of economic growth and efficiency , and to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP of 2000 by 2010 ;  
In accordance with the general outlook and arrangements of the 15th Party Congress regarding China 's modernization in the new century , the session proposed the main goals of endeavor in China 's economic and social development during the 10th Five-year Plan : The national economy is to maintain relatively rapid development , notable results are to be achieved in strategic restructuring of the economy , and there is to be marked improvement in the quality and returns in economic growth , so as to lay a solid foundation for the doubling of 2000 GDP by 2010 ;  
The session held that in achieving sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , it is essential to regard the improvement of economic returns as the central task and carry our strategic readjustment of the economy .  
On the basis of summing up the experience of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and soberly analyzing the domestic and international situation at the turn of the century , the fifth plenum put forward the following major objectives for economic and social development during the 10th Five-Year Plan after carefully analyzing the situation : Maintain a relatively rapid speed of economic development , make progress in strategic economic restructuring and considerably improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth , in a bid to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP in 2010 compared with that of 2000 ;  
The fact that such a large number of world economic magnates will assemble under the banner of developing China 's vast western region suffices to prove that the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision to develop the western region is wise , well-timed , and full of great potential .  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
summed up the great practice in more than 20 years of reform and opening up ; and from the high plane of history and breadth of the world 's scope , profoundly analyzed the opportunities and challenges China faces at the turn of the century and put forward the strategic tasks and guiding principles for China 's economic and social development in the next 5 to 10 years .  It is a programmatic document that will guide us in advancing socialist modernization .  
The " Proposals " reflects the demands of the third-step strategic objective in socialist modernization , the demands of socialist market economic development , the demands of new situations in the new century , and the interests and aspirations of the broad masses .  The entire document is filled with the spirit of emancipating minds , seeking truth from facts , exploring and innovating , and seeking pragmatism .  It has vivid characteristics of the times and is an important document on Marxism .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , China 's society and politics will continue to remain stable , and the socialist market economic system will be further perfected .  The economy of the people of China will continue to develop at a rapid pace , and clear successes will be evident in the strategic restructuring of economic structures .  Increases in economic quality and efficiency will be evident , and state owned enterprises will establish modern management systems and will progress greatly .  
The countries concerned should observe the treaty and other concluded legal documents on arms control and disarmament .  They should not develop or deploy the NMD system , which upsets global strategic balance and stability , nor should they assist other countries in acquiring such a system or interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and undermine their sovereignty and territorial integrity through the proliferation of sophisticated antimissile systems and technologies .  
Once the NMD system is deployed , the results in bilateral and multilateral disarmament and arms control obtained over the past several years will be destroyed in one day .  With the destruction of global strategic stability , unilateralism in international relations will increase .  There will be more unstable factors in both global and regional security .  
In his speech , Wen Jiabao stressed that the fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee , which has just ended , examined and adopted the " Proposal of the CPC Central Committee on the Formulation of the Tenth Five-Year Plan for the National Economic and Social Development " and put forth the strategic mission and guiding principle for China 's economic and social development to march toward the new century , which is a programmatic document guiding our endeavor in the socialist modernization .  
The " proposal " is based on the overall situation and focused on the future ; it is truthful and realistic and attaches great importance to innovation ; with the distinct characteristics of the times , it is forward-looking , purposeful , and of a strategic character .  
New ideas are needed for development . we must persist in advancing strategic economic restructuring , promote the two fundamental shifts , deepen reform , and open wider to the outside world ; we must promote technological innovation and industrial upgrading , carry out the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region , and solve problems accompanying our advance through development .  
Jiang Chunyun pointed out : Implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region is an inevitable requirement for ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy and fulfilling the third-step strategic objective of the country 's modernization drive .  
The fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee , which was held not long ago , regarded the development of human resources as an important strategic task that determines the future of China , and explicitly proposed that " qualified personnel are the most valuable resources , " and the " leading personnel are the crucial elements that carry on past traditions and open up a way to forge ahead into the future . "  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
Rogachev said : Russia 's position is one of firmly exploring all forms of flexible ways and means for building a stronger material foundation for consolidating the strategic partnership and ensuring its long-term nature and stability in accordance with the status of the two countries ' market economy and their respective international obligations so that the bilateral economic and trade cooperation will have the active support from their respective countries . 
Both sides held that the strategic talks , being pragmatic , earnest , positive , and friendly , promoted mutual understanding and attained the desired purpose .  
It is said that titanic schorl is one of the ores that are in seriously short supply in China , as the current annual output is only 3,000 to 4,000 metric tons .  It is listed by the relevant department as one of the 14 strategic reserve ores for which China is heavily dependent on foreign resources .  Titanic schorl can be used to extract the metal titanium .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the ideas of " how to understand four things " put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin involve important theoretical and strategic issues of the contemporary general trends of development of China and the world , are basic questions that must be correctly answered by means of theoretical research on scientific socialism , and are also issues of ideological understanding at a deeper level which the broad masses of party members and cadres are concerned about .  
The regular meeting of the general staff departments of the Chinese and Russian armed forces to discuss international and regional situations and issues of common interest is an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership and a specific embodiment of the further development of relations between the two armed forces , and it will help both sides not only strengthen mutual understanding and trust but also coordinate their stand and strengthen their cooperation in international affairs .  
They should fully recognize the importance of properly carrying out " three stresses " education in colleges and universities in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " and from the strategic vantage point of making ideological , political , and organizational preparations for the challenges in the new century .  They should make active efforts to do a good job in every stage of their work , continuously raise their ideological awareness , and make genuine efforts to prevent and overcome jaded and lackadaisical feelings .  
With the concerted efforts of the leaders , governments , and people of the two countries , the Sino-US relations have maintained the momentum of healthy and steady development in recent years .  As a result , the two sides have reached a consensus on establishing a constructive strategic partnership , come to an agreement on China 's entry into the WTO , and resolved the problem of granting the permanent normal trade relations status to China .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi expressed here today his appreciation for the efforts of US President Clinton in improving Sino-US ties during his presidency over the past eight years .  He said : So long as both Chinese and US leaders , especially US leaders , are able to regard Sino-US ties with a long-term and strategic viewpoint , to abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques , and to fully understand the basic common interests between China and the United States , Sino-US ties will healthily and steadily advance forward in the new century .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
He said : The Ninth Five-Year Plan was one of the best executed five-year plans .  It was through the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan that China accomplished the strategic goal for the second stage of its modernization and the overall living standard of the people reached the level of moderate prosperity , thus laying a solid foundation for the implementation of the strategic plans for the third stage .  
Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's strategic thinking characterized by its broad and long-term view , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , established Shanghai 's strategic position and asked the municipality to be turned into an international economic , financial , and trade center as soon as possible .  
This " give-and-take " strategic readjustment became the mainline of the " Eighth Five-year Plan , " and during the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , this was combined with the overall readjustment of the setup of the municipality 's productive forces to promote the continuous " upgrading " of the standard and the quality of the secondary and tertiary industries .  
Li Lanqing expressed deep belief that full advancement of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is not only in keeping with the basic interests of the two countries and their people , but is also beneficial to regional and global peace and stability .  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
Sichuan has actively implemented the strategic policy decisions of the central authorities regarding the " great development of the western region , " and has put forth the overall working idea of building Sichuan - - with 10 years of struggle - - into an economic powerhouse province in China 's western region and an ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , of harmoniously developing the economy and society , and of realizing new strides . 
The " 10th Five-Year " plan has imposed further demands on reform of the SOEs , as they must accomplish a strategic readjustment of their position in the national economy .  There are things they should engage in , and things they should n't .  Namely , they should pull out of those competitive areas which are not suited to SOE development , while those SOEs which it is necessary to retain should achieve the diversification of entities investing in them through the form of joint-stock companies , establishing a modern enterprise system and improving their economic management .  
It calls for improving the capability for sustained scientific and technological innovation , achieving a technological leap forward , and continuously providing powerful technological support for the strategic economic restructuring and the modernization drive .  
All localities must persist in buying the peasants ' surplus grain at protected open prices , attach great importance to lightening the peasants ' burdens , vigorously promote the strategic restructuring of agriculture and rural economy , actively and steadily develop small towns , and achieve relatively rapid increase of peasant incomes.We must push the major development of west China in a thoroughly sound way .  The western development is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee for taking on the overall situation and facing the new century .  
The framework agreed in 1997 by the two heads of state on " working to build a constructive strategic partnership geared to the 21st century " represented an effort by the leaders of the two countries in hoping to jump out of the set pattern of history and plan an unprecedented new-style cooperative relationship between two major powers with different civilizations , social systems , and different stages of economic development , and its strategic significance can not be underestimated .  
I sincerely hope that all of you here as well as all investors in Hong Kong will ride the east wind of China 's modernization as it makes big strides forward toward the third strategic objective , ride the east wind of the development of west China , ride the east wind of China 's imminent entry into the WTO , and ride the east wind of Hong Kong 's continued prosperity and stability ; overcome the difficulties that lie ahead ;  
This kind of powerful strategic goal , together with the relatively rigid policy of President-elect George W . Bush towards China , surely helps one feel very confident in the resolve of the United States to protect Taiwan . It also stabilizes the gradual drift towards instability among military powers and national powers across the straits .  Because of this , the judgment of some people regarding the future of Taiwan now appears to be excessively pessimistic .  
Experiences leading to the gratifying situation in the air force 's flight safety record are varied and can chiefly be summed up as follows .  First , all air force units always insist on applying the new period 's military strategic thinking in managing things , placing military training at the center of all work , giving priority to flight training arrangements , and well maintaining continuity in flight and in training course .  Second is persistence in subjecting units to tough and strict training .  
To improve the quality of workers and provide effective human resources support for the sustained and fast development of the national economy is a strategic task for the labor security cause .  Zhang Zuoji said : For some time to come , it is necessary to regard the vocational qualification certificate system as the point of breakthrough for the improvement of the quality of workers and popularize the vocational qualification certificate system in a comprehensive way .  
The plenary session defined three major tasks that the CPC must undertake as it heads into the new century - - that is , continuing with the modernization drive , accomplishing reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  It was a historic , strategic policy decision on the part of the CPC to have included among the three major tasks the accomplishment of reunification of the motherland .  
We must vigorously push forward the strategic readjustment of the agriculture structure and the rural economic structure , gear agriculture and the rural economy to the market , rely on science and technology , focus on raising the quality of agriculture products , optimize regional distribution , carry out processing and conversion , and develop industrial management of agriculture .  
The two sides stressed that the friendly cooperative treaty should be based on safeguarding the security and interests of the two countries and their peoples , and that the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership should be substantiated on the political , economic , and military fronts . 
It is readily apparent that the new " cross-strait " structure of " eternal peace " and " political union " that the Taiwanese leader calls for is a " security structure " with a guaranteed " independent standing . "  Under an international strategic position , foreign powers would use this structure to " contain ( China 's ) surroundings " and extend Taiwan a protective umbrella .  
Thus , in order to achieve the strategic target for the new century , Hubei can not adopt the " strategy of following others " in its choice of development model .  Instead , it must adopt a strategy of developing by leaps and bounds .  What this means is that in the process of industrialization , it must persist in using an information-based economy to boost industrialization , fully bring into play its advantage in having a late start , and rely on technological leaps to boost leaps in social productivity from a high starting point .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
We must guide and organize high-tech research and development in the light of the strategic demands of national development and the demands of the market , and effectively promote scientific and technological innovation with a view to achieving our own intellectual property rights in order to develop a high-tech industry that is capable of competing in the international market and developing by leaps and bounds .  
Guided by theoretical study , we should step up study of the international strategic situation and the characteristics and law of military management under the high-technology local war conditions and the new situations ; we should actively organize and coordinate military organs , military academies , scientific research units , and the troops , to systematically study crucial and difficult problems .  
The Golan Heights has an area of 1,860 square km .  It is situated in southwestern Syria and adjacent to Lebanon , Israel , and Jordan . Its terrain is dangerously steep .  It overlooks the Galilee Valley of Israel to the west and guards the passageway into Damascus to the east .  With an abundant water supply , the heights ' strategic position is very important .  
It is necessary to actively study the regularity in the operation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new stage , adopt effective measures according to the local conditions to develop the market-oriented rural economy by bring local advantages into play , raising the quality and efficiency of farming production in suburban areas , and developing agriculture in scope and in depth .  Thus income can be increased in the process of strategic economic restructuring .  
Wu Bangguo indicated : At present , China has already shaken off the adverse influences of the Asian financial crisis , a smooth progress has been registered in the country 's strategic readjustments to its economic structure , the three-year target for the reform and the difficulty-relief work of state enterprises has been basically fulfilled , and China 's national economic development has taken a major turn for the better and has maintained the momentum of a fairly fast growth .  
Taking into consideration the country 's overall interest , basing on its correct assessment of the situation , and showing its keen determination to carry out reform , the party 's leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has put forward strategic tasks and guidelines for China 's economic and social development in the coming five to 10 years , thus drawing up a magnificent blueprint for China 's development in the new century from the high plane of history and from the angle of the entire world .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
The two important documents approved by the meeting , the " Beijing Manifesto " and the " Outline for Sino-African Economic and Social Development , " comprehensively expounded the common ideas of China and Africa regarding major international issues such as establishing a new international political and economic order , determined that China and Africa will build an enduringly stable new-style strategic partnership of equality and mutual benefit , and also set down new lines of thought for Sino-African cooperation in substantive fields such as economics and trade .  
At the meeting , Zhu Rongji pointed out : In the past five years , the people of all nationalities throughout the country were united in brave advancement under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to make great achievements in all areas , fulfill the Ninth Five-Year Plan as scheduled , and successfully achieve the second-step strategic objective of modernization in the face of complex international and domestic situations .  
The two venerable professors then acquainted Li Lanqing with their lives , work situation and , moreover , showed heartfelt happiness for the diligent implementation of the Science-Teaching-to-Prosper-the-Nation strategic direction under the leadership of the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , respect for teachers and teaching , valuing talent , the obvious achievements it has attained in the vibrant development in the cause of Chinese education , and in improving teachers work and living conditions .  
What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .  And , with the two highly destructive " poisonous spiritual arrows " directly aimed at China , a marvelous strategic sight has taken shape , in which all the major forces with great interests in the region point their strategic focus at China .  
Under such strategic positioning , the Indian military has worked out a multi-directional strategic principle of " attacking the west , resisting the north , going south , and maintaining stability internally , " which means that India should adopt a posture of vigorous offensive against Pakistan in order to defeat it once and for all ; 
India 's concept of military strategy has always been linked with the issue of territory .  Moreover , it entertains the idea of not hesitating to go to war .  For example , it has defined an offensive principle of " piecemeal encroachment of territory , internal subversion , military superiority , and strategic deterrent . "  
and the improvement in the living standard as the starting point .  It will uphold the principle of " striving for high efficiency , increasing employment opportunities , and maintaining sustained development " ; push forward the national economy and social informationization ; and speed up the process of industrialization and urbanization , thus laying a solid foundation for the three-step strategic goals .  The main targets are : maintaining sustained rapid healthy national economic development and striving for an annual GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent .  
In today 's world , innovation in science and technology has become the main motive force behind the world economic and social development and has become a strategic commanding height in international economic competition and rivalry of overall national strength .  
Second , it can spur China , through evoking national self-respect , to whip up an unprecedented space arms race thus exhausting China 's economic strength to the maximum , shifting China 's strategic goal of taking economic construction as the center , luring China into all-round competition with the United States , and finally wearing China out and forcing it onto the road traversed before by the Soviet Union .  
He said : " Running the country with virtue " and instituting an ideological and moral system adapting to the developing socialist market economy are a long-term strategic task and a huge project of systems engineering , and this calls for joint efforts by people in various circles , continuously studying new situations in practice , and summing up fresh experiences .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou emphasized yesterday that the National Unification Guidelines is a strategic and practical document based on legal principle .  Moreover , the guidelines take into account the spirit of the Constitution and current political situation in the Taiwan Strait and have played a guiding role over the last 10 years of cross-strait relations in serving as a link between the past and the future .  
First , before and after George W . Bush assumed office , he declared that the United States would promote a diplomatic policy based on a " unipolar world " and stressed the " leading position " of the United States . Meanwhile , he announced that the United States would adjust its global strategy and shift the strategic emphasis from Europe to the Middle East and Asia .  
Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .  But Russia today does not have the money to continue to develop them .  Taking advantage of the other 's problem , the United States is setting a trap for Russia by using its NMD program to egg Russia on to develop high-expense anti-missile system , thereby causing Russia 's national economy to be bled white by huge outlay of military expenses .  
To lay a solid foundation for achieving a gross domestic product in 2010 that is double the 2000 figure , the document is expected to call for maintaining a fairly rapid pace of national economic development , achieving remarkable results in the strategic realignment of the economic structure , and achieving marked improvements in the quality of economic growth and economic returns .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
The new US Administration recently increased defense spending by a big margin and has vigorously pressed ahead its NMD [ national missile defense ] program , drawing strong denouncements from the international community .  However , a small number of countries , such as Japan , have not complained at all about the US act to dominate the world , which will spark a global arms race .  Moreover , Japan has exerted itself in cooperating with the United States in developing a strategic missile defense system .  
Zhu Rongji said in his report : The main objectives of economic and social development in the next five years are as follows - - maintain a rather fast growth rate in the national economy , achieve marked results in the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , substantially enhance the quality and efficiency of the economic growth , lay a solid foundation for doubling the 2000 gross domestic product in 2010 ;  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
the Ninth Five-Year Plan raised the idea of changing the country 's economic structure and growth pattern ; while the 10th Five-Year Plan has emphasized that the country " must center its efforts around the task of improving economic efficiency , and must make strategic readjustments to its economic structure . "  Today , the quality and efficiency of China 's economic development have both been enhanced to an unprecedentedly high level .  
Deputies expressed the view one after another : With the solid foundation laid in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period and a practical program for development , the people across the country , full of confidence , will certainly be able to make ever greater and more brilliant achievements while advancing toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive on the new march .  
In considering the strategic arrangements and important measures for the reform , opening up , and modernization , it is imperative to regard development as the theme , structural adjustment as the principal line , the reform and opening up and advancement in science and technology as the driving forces , and the improvement of the people 's living standard as the fundamental point of departure .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
They should lay special emphasis on the study of the international strategic situation , high-tech local warfare , and the law of military management characteristic of the new situation so as to keep enhancing the scientific nature and effectiveness of their work of PLA construction and preparedness for military struggles .  
The deputies held that in consolidating the achievements of state enterprise reforms it is essential to adopt methods such as establishing a modern enterprise system , carrying out strategic readjustment of the pattern of state-owned economy , reorganizing the state enterprises , and speeding up technical progress in the enterprises in order to resolve structural obstacles in the state enterprises , foster the enterprises ' capability in technical and system innovation , and establish as soon as possible a social security setup commensurate with the state enterprise reforms .  
Kim Tae-chung maintained that the DPRK Government 's commitment to improve relations with the United States and the ROK is based on sincerity and is a " strategic choice " made through careful and deep consideration .  But , he added , the relaxed situation in the Korean Peninsula is very weak , just like a fleeting opportunity .  
If we want to occupy a position in the highly competitive field of advanced science and high technology and to put ourselves in a favorable position in global economic development , we must pay great attention to the issue of intellectual property rights , looking at it from a strategic angle , " said Xu Guanhua , CPPCC member and newly appointed minister of science and technology .  
" Independent intellectual property rights must be concentrated on high-tech fields with strategic significance .  We must endeavor to make breakthroughs in some crucial technological fields that have a bearing on the economic lifeline and national security . "  
I believe that in the course of implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan and realizing the third strategic objective in the new century , minority areas can seize the opportunity afforded by the great development of the west to speed up economic development and social progress and raise the living standard of the minority nationalities so as to gradually bring about the common development and joint prosperity of all nationalities . "  
Like the whole country , over the past five years , Jiangsu scored brilliant achievements in its economic and social development , and on the whole the province completely attained the goal of enabling its people to live a relatively comfortable life with the county as a unit and realized a historical leap from just having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively comfortable life .  Southern Jiangsu and some areas along the Chang Jiang have started ahead of time to stride toward the third-step strategic goals .  
The people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continued to advance along the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , successfully fulfilled the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development , achieved the second-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and laid a good foundation for advancing toward the third-step strategic objective .  
Under such circumstances , if Sichuan fails to develop itself or fails to develop itself fast enough , it will surely fall behind .  In view of this , we must firmly grasp the main line of conducting strategic economic restructuring ; and must ensure that the province 's GDP can total 589 billion yuan by 2005 , growing at an average annual rate of 8 percent and above .  
This session held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , upheld the party 's basic line , comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and discussed the major strategic , macro , and policy issues facing China in entering a new stage of development in comprehensively building a comfortably well-off society and speeding up socialist modernization .  
The NPC deputies said : The " Outline " fully embodies the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Congress . It has a clear guiding ideology ; shows pronounced characteristics of the times ; sets practical and feasible targets ; thoroughly analyzes a series of strategic , macro , and policy issues concerning China 's national economic and social development ; and sets forth measures to deal with those issues .  This is a good outline program for seeking truth , attending to practical matters , and elevating the morale .  
Looking ahead , we have set our goals clearly : During the period under the 10th Five-Year Plan , we shall maintain a relatively fast pace of development of the national economy , achieve marked results in the strategic adjustment to the economic structure , significantly improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and lay a solid foundation for the doubling of the 2000 GDP by 2010 ;  
Since the second half of 1998 , under the leadership of the party central committee and the State Council , the State Development Planning Commission started to organize personnel to make preliminary preparations and conduct investigation and study for the formulation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which included more than 140 special subjects totaling as many as five million words and covered such contents as the basic judgment on the domestic and international environments , the principal development targets , the basic strategic choices , the main considerations about policies , and so on .  
Positively pushing forward the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , promoting the two fundamental changes , and maintaining the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy are the main line of China 's economic development in the early years of the 21st century .

His delegation called upon the major Powers to stop providing military , financial and strategic support , as well as direct and indirect financing for the construction of new settlements , since that posed a threat to a just and lasting peace in the region .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
To achieve its goals in this area , UNCTAD uses to its maximum extent the leverage of the information technology paradox : contrary to previous technological revolutions , which have largely concentrated economic power and competitiveness in a handful of capital-rich and technology-intensive national economies , the information revolution has made strategic technologies and information much more affordable , even for the smaller players . 
This frontier was described as the " existing administrative border between the Republics of Montenegro and Croatia " and the reason stated for " raising the issue of borders " were " historic , geographic and other interests arising from the military significance and strategic position of Prevlaka and the entire Boka Kotorska Bay " .

As Japan has long advocated that the Department of Humanitarian Affairs remain faithful to its function as a strategic centre for coordination and that it refrain from becoming involved in the operational field of humanitarian activities , it welcomes such an orientation , and is confident that , with its new and streamlined functions , the Office of the Emergency Relief Coordinator , together with the strengthened Inter-Agency Standing Committee ( IASC ) , will contribute to an effective response to humanitarian crises .  
The continued presence of Rwandan refugees in neighbouring countries has had a number of serious , closely linked consequences of several kinds : humanitarian ( suffering endured ) , economic ( depleted humanitarian assistance ) , political and strategic ( interests of States ) , ecological ( destruction of host States ' ecosystems ) and security ( military and paramilitary activities of former FAR and militia members , as well as border insecurity ) . 
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and " physical " ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
The working methods and procedures which are ordinarily used in the Conference as instruments for decision _ making were devised to serve the old order ; in the years to come , the challenge will be not only to adjust our strategic thinking to the demise of the East _ West dialectic but to come to grips with a security agenda which is more diverse , rich and complex , both in geopolitical and in functional terms .

Just last month , on the bilateral level , the United States of America and the Russian Federation announced initiatives taken in the areas of strategic security and nuclear security that will make a positive and constructive contribution to the global nuclear arms control and disarmament agenda .  
The decision gradually to remove up to 500 tons of highly enriched uranium and up to 50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium from nuclear military programmes is an effective contribution by Russia to ensuring that nuclear disarmament is irreversible .  The 1972 Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems ( ABM ) is of paramount importance to nuclear disarmament as a key element of strategic stability and a prerequisite for further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
On the contrary , the provisions of the Constitution , the Federal Education Act , which is the result of participation by organizations and sectors representing the entire national community , and the strategic guidelines it has drawn up in this regard are designed , on the basis of equity , to encourage broader educational coverage and quality at all levels and for all sectors of the population , particularly the most underprivileged .

Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .

New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .

In the debate at this session on proposals for reforming the United Nations , I would like , at the outset , to state that the strategic objective of all of the reforms envisaged must be to provide better conditions for the proper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil its founders ' dream of a lasting , democratic , responsible and credible Organization .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .

Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
In strategic objective F . 5 , the Platform for Action calls for the elimination of occupational segregation by promoting the equal participation of women in highly skilled jobs and senior management positions , and through other measures that stimulate women 's on-the-job career development and upward mobility in the labour market , and by stimulating the diversification of occupational choices by both women and men ; women should be encouraged to take up non-traditional jobs ; and men should be encouraged to seek employment in the social sector ( para . 178 ( g ) ) .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
At the end of the three-year period , it would be possible to evaluate the degree to which the objectives had been attained and on that basis decide whether work on enterprise development represented an important contribution to development and therefore whether it should form part of the elements presented for ministerial consideration at UNCTAD X . In short , work on an enterprise development strategy must be based on a strategic vision , the elements of the strategy must contribute to growth and development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability , and the strategy must be amenable to evaluation . 
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
More generally , ACC members called for complementary actions by the United Nations system , in close partnership with other actors , to support country-level efforts at relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , and agreed upon the broad elements of a common strategic framework for response to , and recovery from , crisis , as part of the system 's overall effort to help secure durable peace and pursue or restore sustainable development in countries in crisis situations .  
The emphasis that the African common position placed on poverty reduction as one of its main strategic objectives was intended to let solidarity play its role as a driving force in a sustainable development that would combine environmental preservation with the rational use of the planet \ x { e5b8 } limited resources .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .

The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .  
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
Provision of up-to-date and relevant information on emerging regional and global issues and potential environmental threats likely to lead to potential conflicts , critical hot spots or emergency situations , as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;

In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
There is an intrinsic interrelationship between strategic offensive weapons and strategic defensive weapons , one laid down in the ABM Treaty itself in the form of a clear understanding that , given parity in terms of strategic offensive weapons , the emergence of strategic means of defence in the hands of one of the parties would be equivalent to an increase in the power of a pre _ emptive nuclear strike .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .

In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
Encouragement of strategic alliances between research and development institutions and potential technology users to harness the creative capabilities of the scientific communities in the development of new , proven and innovative adaptation strategies and relevant technologies suitable to the particular circumstances of small island developing States , for example , in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
In the post _ cold _ war world which emerged at the beginning of the present decade , the initial phase of optimism , cooperation and the adoption of major decisions in the field of world strategic policy has gradually been replaced by another in which narrow individual and often intransigent considerations on the part of the various international actors tend to prevail .  
Central America is preparing to cross the bridge between the millennia with all its republics more integrated with each other than ever before , identifying with each other in the common ideal of keeping ourselves united so that we are stronger , of playing a stellar role in the American continent , of turning the isthmus into a point of strategic convergence for world trade , and of writing ourselves into a success story that will serve as an example and touchstone to the world community .

First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
On the basis of its comprehensive analysis of the current international and domestic situation , the party central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core requires that the party 's ideological and political work be done intensively and effectively , and takes this as an urgent strategic task related to the general situation of socialist reform and construction in our country for the whole party and the entire people of the whole nation .  
As a result , with the help of our troops in northern Manchuria , which attacked the enemy forces across the Linjiang three times , our troops in southern Manchuria successfully guarded Linjiang in four battles .  Subsequently , we successfully launched the spring and summer offensive and , as a result , our military situation in northeast China changed from strategic defense to strategic offense .  
We have persisted in implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the city on the strength of science and education , conscientiously placing education in the strategic position that gives top priority to educational development , and continuously increasing the financial input into education , so that a relatively complete educational system has been formed , and the 12-year education system has been made universal in the city five years ahead of schedule prescribed by the state .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
Whoever has a basic strategic insight would come to this conclusion : Respecting China 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and developing comprehensive cooperation with China will bring about more realistic and long-term strategic interests than interfering in China 's internal affairs ; playing around with " Taiwan independence " forces will not only cause them to lose these interests , but also bring about greater losses in strategic interests .  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
After watching the exercise , Chi Haotian said : The Air Force is a hi-tech service which fights decisive battles in the air but relies on ground support .  Without strong logistics support , the Air Force would be deprived of strong combat effectiveness .  Chi stressed and pointed out : Conducting scientific and technological training is a major measure for implementing Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong force through science and technology ;  
The 15th National Party Congress has formulated the strategic program of gearing the construction of a socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  The completion of this new historical task depends on the leading groups and the leading cadres at all levels , on the continuous upgrading of their leadership standard and government standard , and on the continuous strengthening of their ability to resist corruption and degeneration , and on their work to further solidify the party and the people , so that together we can struggle to move forward with our grand undertaking .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
Such a practice is a covert unilateral nuclear arms expansion in essence , which not only is unfavorable to the safeguarding of the global strategic balance and stability , but will also shake the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear nonproliferation .  
After establishing " energy and transportation as key strategic points , " the late ' 80s and early ' 90s saw the inception of huge projects such as the Three Gorges Dam , the comprehensive hydro-power development of the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He River , accelerating development of western oil and central coal fields , and the extension of the Yanlonghai railway line as the " second continental bridge , " among other large-scale projects that concentrated funding in the west .  
At the beginning of 2000 , China 's national economy faced a new strategic mission , which was the structural adjustment of agriculture .  Many sharp contradictions exist among development and environmental protection , sustainable development and agricultural structural adjustment .  
In deciding on a strategic goal , we should try to meet our national security needs and comply with at once the needs of our national economic development and electronic information industry development and the needs of increasingly fierce competition on the domestic and international markets .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
To attain this strategic objective , it used as bait such Preferential economic conditions as expanding trade , increasing investment , and cutting or waiving debts , and forced African countries to initiate political and economic reforms , Remolding them according to its subjective desire .  
Yu Yongbo said : From a overall-situation and strategic perspective , Chairman Jiang 's important speech scientifically analyzed the situation and tasks facing party building , elaborated in depth the extreme importance of enhancing the party 's governing and leading ability according to the requirements of the " three represents , " and laid down an important plan on completely advancing the new great project of party building .  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Chen Xiaojin : Over the past 20 years since reform and opening up , in accordance with a series of important instructions issued by Comrade Deng Xiaoping , including " China-made vessels should fight into the international market , " China 's shipbuilding industry has adhered to export as its orientation ; has forged ahead with pioneering efforts ; has realized such a strategic transformation from " building vessels for military use in the main " to " turning vessels for military use into vessels for civil use and building vessels for civil use in the main " ;  
As far as the present situation is concerned , making full preparations for military combat ( jun shi dou zheng ) is the most realistic and urgent strategic mission for the whole army .  This will have a bearing not only on the realization of the great cause of reunifying the motherland but on whether our army will be able to have the strategic initiative in hand in the future .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
Nevertheless , Taiwan , being a typical hilly island and surrounded by the sea , is narrow in space and lacks strategic depth .  Crowded with 23-million people , the 36,000 square kilometer island is absolutely unable to resist forced entry by a power .  At the moment , the Taiwan authorities are going against the historical trend .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
The most conspicuous feature is that , the air force has now replaced the 70-year-old classic theory concerning " air supremacy " with the theory that the " air force , surrounding its central mission of ensuring ' air supremacy , ' should become the strategic service of first choice having the capabilities of ensuring supremacy on land , at sea , in the air , and in the electromagnetic space ; and a force that can play a decisive role in waging a high-tech regional war . "  
We should put special stress on the scientific and technological projects that are of crucial strategic , fundamental , and key significance to our national defense and to our military modernization development , should accelerate our measures for solving key problems in these projects , should make painstaking effort and should work in an independent and innovative manner .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
The move in fact represents unilateral nuclear arms build-up in disguised form .  The move will not only bring severe damage to the integrity and vitality of the ABM treaty and the global strategic balance and stability , but will also seriously disrupt the basis for the US-Russia bilateralnuclear reductions , impede the international nuclear disarmament process , thus shatter the prerequisite and basis for international nuclear non-proliferation .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
The large-scale development of the western region as a major strategic task of the party and the state is now placed in a salient position .  Xinjiang situated along the northwestern border of the country is an important part of large-scale development in the western region , which will have a bearing on the overall situation in economic development .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
Geopolitically , Taiwan is situated in the center of a chain of islands in the westernmost Pacific Rim . It is not only a critical point of China 's maritime traffic between the north and south , but also represents the strategic spot in the Western Pacific , and is extremely important to the strategic structure of the Asia-Pacific region .  
We should take a strategic view of being responsible for the future of our military construction .  We should devote efforts to doing well the work of cultivating , using and improving college-graduate cadres .  We should change our thinking , make reasonable arrangements , and create the conditions so that they , in military construction , can make great achievements that are worthy of this great epoch .  
The new leader of the Taiwan authorities stressed that in its long-term development prospects , the Taiwan navy must have the strategic goals of being a " crack , small , and strong force " , meaning that it should advance in the following ways : First , it must focus its vision on the distant future and draw up as soon as possible its mid and long-term manpower building plans ;  
Since the end of the Cold War , in order to maintain its leading position as " the only superpower capable of lording it over " , the United States has gradually cultivated a global strategy such as " controlling two oceans and striking from both sides " in light of a new international strategic pattern .  
We should adjust the military 's logistical structure in a scientific manner based on the principle of being qualified , combination , and high efficiency , perfect the support system , strengthen mobile support forces , and enhance the strategic support function .  
To meet with the " limited " strategic missile defense task requirements , the US Defense Department 's Ballistic Missile Defense Bureau has made , in line with the mass production principle , unified arrangements for the research projects of the TMD and NMD systems under the BMD plan .  The ultimate purpose is to enable these defense systems to coordinate with each other in combined operations , to jointly deal with a series of threats , and to provide a " nearly seamless defense network for the United States and for its allies " .  
We should depend on ourselves and be innovative .  We should try to make significant breakthroughs in strategic , fundamental and crucial sectors and should devote great efforts to accelerating measures for transforming achievements in scientific research into combat strength and productive forces .  These are urgent and significant issues confronting the colleges and universities of our military .  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
The most visible intention was the new Taiwan leader 's public putting forward the military strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " in an attempt to turn defensive into offensive and to issue a military threat to the mainland .  
But due to Russia 's stiff resistance , the United States dares not make the plunge outright and is compelled to constantly enhance political , economic , military , and diplomatic relations with Ukraine and with other neighboring countries of Russia and to realize its strategic purposes gradually through " contacts " and in a " trot-like " manner .  
In addition to infiltrating Russia 's neighboring countries , the United States has also accelerated the pace of developing diplomatic and military cooperation relations with Mongolia in a " leapfrog " fashion in an attempt to take advantage of the unique strategic position of Mongolia and to place " an outpost " between China and Russia to monitor and control the movements of China and Russia and to deter Russia from the south and to carry out " peaceful evolution " against China from the north .  
The meticulous strategic setup that the United States worked out in Russia 's neighboring countries was not only designed to squeeze Russia 's strategic space but also to set up in advance an effective strategic support platform to interfere in the Euro-Asian region affairs in future .  
In the 1999 Kosovo war , the United States further turned " humanitarian assistance " into a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of a sovereign state , raising the " non-war military operation " to a strategic level .  
At the close of the century , the US accelerated the development of its National Missile Defense ( NMD ) plan , all in the name of defense .  However , the true nature of the plan is to destroy the existing global strategic balance , and to seek to establish a kind of absolute military advantage in both attack and defense .  
With its huge nuclear arsenal and policy of insisting on a nuclear first strike , the United States put all its strength behind developing and deploying NMD . This is in the hope of weakening or even depriving other nations with nuclear capabilities of their anti-missile capabilities , and , extending the threat one step further , this will have a deep and far-reaching negative effect on the global strategic order .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping summed up the global strategic issues into four characters , " east , west , south , and west " .  He also defined the " north-south issue " , which reflects the gap between rich and poor , as a " core issue " .  
However , when noticing the actual strength and the military movements of the United States , people tend to overlook the fact that the strategic goal of the United States does not simply lie in its pursuit of a military and economic dominance , or in the need for acquiring a guarantee for its national security interests .  Rather , the strategic goal of the United States has another ultimate value , that is , it wishes to " mold " the future world according to its own ideal design .  
For the various policies that the United States has adopted for the implementation of its national strategy , one distinct feature is that differences in ideologies and values are being used to serve specific strategic purposes ; and as it has turned out , the United States is practicing a double standard when evaluating human rights and social values .  
Apart from bringing true a seamless combination between the " soft " and the " tough " powers of the US strategy , high technologies have also , by making use technological export controls and related policies , found a strategic means that lies between the two powers , that is , the " dominating position of the United States " as described by Brzezinski . All this means that with a sustained effort , the United States will seek to keep firm control over the leading zone on the scientific and technological front in the 21st century .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
After the cold war ended , the U.S . military 's traditional opponent has gone out of existence .  Driven by its strategic need to assert sole hegemony over the globe with its " new cold-war thinking " and its narrow interest in expanding the increasingly shrinking survival space for military forces , the U.S . military has always been concocting a virtual opponent .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
Since the convening of the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , those involved in civil air defense work have constantly emancipated the mind , deepened reforms , aggressively explored new ways in China 's peacetime civil air defense building , and helped bring about a strategic transformation in the guiding thought of civil air defense building , namely , a transformation from preparation for fighting " an early war , a major war , a nuclear war " to the track of modernization building centering on the economic construction in peacetime ; 
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
This shows that China 's comprehensive national strength will eventually move above the major mark of $ 1,000-billion and that China has comprehensively achieved its second-step strategic target in the course of modernization and will move ahead with great momentum toward the objective of becoming more prosperous and powerful in the 21st century .  
However , the party central leadership and the State Council displayed its strategic insight , grasped the trend in the development and changes of the domestic and foreign economic situation , resolutely readjusted the orientation of macroeconomic control , and made a timely decision on shifting the primary task in macroeconomic control from curbing inflation to expanding domestic demand and overcoming deflation .  
The making of such a change was an important and timely strategic decision made by the party central leading body and the State Council according to its correct analysis of the domestic and international situation and development tendencies , with principal contradictions being grasped accurately .  
Not only does information industry have a decisive impact on the livelihood of the ordinary people in China today but also , more importantly , it has become an important indicator of China 's comprehensive national strength .  Moreover , it has been universally acknowledged as China 's strategic industry in its economic and social development in the next century .  
With the acceleration of the establishment of the modern enterprise system , the strategic readjustment of the national economy , and the successive introduction of major reform measures , such as changing debts into equity , mergers and reorganization , the vitality of state-owned enterprises increased significantly and the goal of getting enterprises out of their plight was basically attained .  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
In particular , we acted in line with urban defense operations , with all priority cities acting in line with their respective strategic status , to build a number of key projects such as mass concealed defense works and key strong points .  
seriously put into practice all the major strategic policy-decisions of the party Central Committee ; given wide publicity to the main melody of our time in line with the work arrangements made by the provincial party committee and the provincial government and in the light of Sichuan 's realistic conditions ; and have done a great deal of work and achieved sound work results in boosting both the economic development growth and an all-round social progress in our province .  
Practice has fully demonstrated that Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking of revitalizing the military through science and technology is wise and correct .  Practice has sufficiently proven that troop training in science and technology is the fundamental way for improving our military 's ability in winning high-tech wars .  Practice has eloquently shown that revitalizing the military through science and technology and troop training in science and technology are of vital importance for the overall situation of our military 's modernization construction .  
By observing the on-the-spot demonstration , exchanging experience and conducting research and study , they have enhanced their understanding of the strategic significance of scientific and technological military training , and they have also added a new motive force to scientific and technological military training .  The scientific and technological military training achievements on display have shown a new direction for military training .  The efforts to sum up and exchange the experience and practices of scientific and technological military training have led us to a new concept for scientific and technological military training .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
At present , the people throughout the province have a strong desire and high enthusiasm for making progress and speeding up economic and social development .  We ardently hope to seize the historic opportunity brought about by the state 's strategic decision on making the great development of the western areas to effective fast economic development .  
Therefore , we should understand the vital significance of structural adjustment from the strategic point of view , speed up the economic structural adjustment and upgrading , and cultivate and bring up the industries and products with strong competitive power .  Only in this way can we remain invincible in the increasingly vehement international competition in the 21st century .  
What warrants our special attention is that the " Proposal " for the first time oriented the " vigorous promotion of the national economy and universal application of information technologies in society " as a " strategic move to embrace the overall construction for modernization " , unequivocally proposing that the " information technology should contribute to industrialization , display its newly emerging superiority , and achieve leaping development in the social productive forces " .  
As long as we seek unity of thinking , have a firm grasp of the principal line of strategic economic structural adjustment , persist in doing a good job of economic structural adjustment in the course of development , and maintain the rapid development while making economic structural adjustment , we will certainly usher in a still more glorious and splendid future .  
Commanders at all levels should effectively correct the erroneous trend of appreciating advanced weapons while neglecting backward ones , appreciating battle equipment while neglecting that used for logistic purposes , and appreciating hardware while neglecting software aspects of equipment .  They should , in light of the overall situation , make project plans from a broad and strategic perspective of balanced development and overall advancement .  
If the United States deploys NMD , this will mean that the currently fragile Russian-US strategic balance will be broken , that Russia 's nuclear deterrent force will " be rendered ineffective , " and that the previous Russian-US nuclear disarmament will turn to be a disguised move for doing away with Russia 's nuclear weapons .  
That Putin lost no time in putting forward his proposals before attending the informal meeting of APEC leaders on 15 November shows that Russia is ready to continue to greatly reduce and finally eliminate nuclear arms on the basis of maintaining strategic stability ; and using the forum of the unofficial meeting of APEC leaders to publicize Russia 's ideas was for the purpose of gaining further international support on this issue .  
Only by following leap-forward thinking for development ; building informationalized units while informationalizing our units step by step at the same time ; and raising our country 's strategic deterrent and war deterrent will it be possible to provide reliable guarantee for fighting and winning a future hi-tech war .  
This is to last about two years .  This is a major move for further implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , spurring the whole party to study in depth the important thinking on the " three represents , " strengthening and improving party leadership over rural work , and tangibly enhancing the quality of the rural grassroots cadres ; and it is also a major new strategic arrangement following the central authorities ' October 1994 arrangement for concentrated rectification of backward rural party branches .  
S . relations with a strategic vision and from the long-term perspective .  In the future , we will continue to work hard with the new administration in the United States to actively advance bilateral relations to make new improvements and new progress , based on the principles of the three Sino-U.S . aftertime , especially mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , non-interference in one another 's internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit .  
Issuing and implementing the " armament regulation " will play a positive and important role in profoundly carrying out the strategic military principles in the new period , reinforcing the centralized leadership in the armament work , standardizing the operating mechanism in armament work and establishing and completing the legal system of armament work .  
Based on the overall strategic plan for national economic and social development for the new period , in the next five to 10 years the tourist industry should play a more vigorous role in promoting reform and opening-up , implementing the policy of expanding domestic demand , accelerating economic restructuring , and improving the people 's living standards .  
Second , it is positively implementing strategic adjustment of the economic structure , and it is doing all we can to achieve comprehensive advancement of tertiary industries in the direction of speeding up the development of modern service industries , powerfully developing high-tech industries , and positively moving modernization of agriculture forward .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
The military should reinforce Party-building in the military according to the requirements of the " three represents " and strengthen ideological and political construction in light of the assurance of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption . "  The military should be ready for military struggles with the military strategic principle in the new period as the guideline , profoundly study characteristics and rules regarding not only the military administration in the new situation but also high-tech regional wars , improve leadership skills and devote efforts to solid implementation .  
The pro-Taiwan forces in the United States , who have called themselves " the blue unit , " have also advanced quite a few political propositions marked by strong ideological colors , and this has undermined the US-China relations ' healthy development and has frequently contravened the US strategic interests as well .  
Now that China has constantly enhanced her national strength in an all-round way , generally speaking , the Sino-US relations are expected to move forward in spite of frequent friction , and out of considerations for its own strategic interests , the United States is also expected to carry on its arms sales to Taiwan within limited space only . 
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
In order to implement Chairman Jiang 's strategic thinking on building a strong army with science and technology and to fully mobilize enthusiasm and creativity of professional and technological cadres , with the approval of the Central Military Commission , the four general departments have jointly issued a circular on raising relevant treatment for some senior experts in our army as of this year .  
We should promote the precious 863 spirit , seize the opportunity , keep up with the global trend , continuously devote efforts to significant scientific and technological projects that play a strategic , fundamental and crucial role in our national development of the economy , science , technology , national defense and the society , accelerate measures for solving crucial problems in these projects , and be self-dependent and innovative .  
The Russian President , foreign minister , defense minister , and many other political and military leaders have recently pointed out in speeches or articles that the key factor determining international security in the new century is to maintain strategic stability , and the basis of this strategic stability is the ABM Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972 .  
Technology innovation has become the main motive force driving world economic and social development and a strategic commanding point in international economic competition as well as competition in overall national strength .  
Developing a good system and social environment conducive to bringing into play the initiative and creativity of scientific and technological personnel is a major pressing strategic task .  We must step up the reform of the scientific personnel system , take additional steps to formulate and perfect all kinds of encouragement policies and measures .  
Party committees , political institutions and leaders at all levels should profoundly and satisfactorily do this ideological and political work , guiding retired cadres to think from a strategic perspective of the reforming , dynamic and stable overall situation of the country and the military construction .  
During these five years China has enjoyed political stability , economic development , social progress , and ethnic solidarity ; all-round national strength has risen to a new level , living standards have on the whole reached a comfortably well-off level , and we have victoriously achieved the second strategic goal in socialist modernization .  
Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , the whole army persisted in being guided by Deng Xiaoping 's thinking on army building in the new period and Chairman Jiang Zemin 's series of important expositions on army building , and implemented in depth the military strategic guidelines for the new era ; closely centering on the two historic topics of " winning when fighting " and " not degenerating , " we achieved very great success in vigorously enhancing overall construction centered on modernization .  
In the past five years our army has completely fulfilled the strategic task of reducing its personnel by 500,000 , totally ceased all commercial activities of the armed forces and armed police , won great victory in the fight against floods in 1998 , organized with high standards the parade for the 50th anniversary of the PRC , defended national sovereignty , security , and the unity of the motherland , and preserved social stability , and thus provided a reliable guarantee for China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
According to the long-range goal put forth at the 15th Party Congress , our country will scale a new height in economic and social development during the 10th five-year period .  The goal is : Maintaining a relatively rapid development pace in the national economy , achieving notable results in strategic economic restructuring , and significantly improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth , thereby laying a strong foundation for the GDP in 2010 to double that of 2000 ;  
To ensure sustained development and realize the third step strategic objective for economic and social development , we should always stick to the established basic national policy and seriously handle the relations between economic construction on the one hand and population , resources , and environment on the other .  
In conclusion , Committee Member Song Linfei stressed that , besides system innovation and efforts by enterprises , speeding up the urbanization process , bringing into full play the synergy of factors , strengthening the role of agricultural industrialization in promoting urbanization , and forming strong regional economic centers and growth points are also important strategic measures that should be taken in order to raise the international competitiveness of our domestic economy and cope with economic globalization .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
Qian Qichen said : Not long ago , President Jiang Zemin and President Bush exchanged letters and reached an important understanding on the development of Sino-US relations .  This demonstrates the strategic vision of the leaders and reflects the wishes of common citizens .  It points out a way forward for the effort to carry on from the past and forge ahead into the future in Sino-US relations .  
We should unite comprehensive efforts from both the military and colleges and universities , give priority to cultivating senior specialists , and cultivate and mold ranks of commanders with comprehensive abilities , contingents of staff with strategic ideas , groups of technological specialists and a larger number of coaches with " capabilities in the four aspects " .  We should focus on improving their abilities in project planning , organizing , administering and teaching .  We should rely on new military professionals of high quality for boosting development of military training through science and technology at deeper levels .  
( 2 ) Implementing a military strategic principle for the new period ; meeting the requirements of " fighting and winning " and " remaining unchanged in nature " ; facing a modernization drive , the world , and the future ; further developing military practice ; and serving national defense building , army building , and a military struggle .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
The central authorities ' decision to carry out study and educational activities in rural areas throughout the country concerning the important thinking of the " three represents " is an important basic project to step up and improve the party 's leadership over rural work , to deepen rural reform , and boost rural economic and social development , as well as a strategic measure to step up the building of the work style of rural grass-roots cadres .  
The vast numbers of rural grass-roots cadres should practice a good work style and lead the broad masses of peasants to push ahead strategic adjustments of the agricultural and rural economic structures , and help peasants increase their incomes and live a happy life .  
Chi Haotian fully affirmed the achievements made by military units and armed police units in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
Currently people generally believe that information security and the task of keeping information confidential is no longer an issue of simply maintaining secrecy , let alone an issue of pure technology .  It is instead a major strategic topic that has to do with national security , economic development , social stability and the success and failure of military struggles .  
The gearing effect of improving and developing its relations with the United States will not only enable India to gain more strategic initiative in dealing with the other big powers and create an international and peripheral security environment to its own advantage , but it will all the more give impetus to India to make a big step forward to the world political and diplomatic arena .  
PRC vice premier Qian Qichen 's trip to the United States may have resulted in some mutual strategic understanding , and yielded some preliminary benefits , but at the same time , with the defection of PLA colonel Xu Junping and the blatant spy cases involving scholars traveling to the US , relations between the US and China have not been able to emerge from the shadows , and just now the possibility for worsening and more tense relations exists .  
This is a major strategic disposition made by the party Central Committee and the State Council in light of the grim situation in public order currently facing China . It embodies a strong desire of the broad masses of the people and represents the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
What integrated strategic operations basically means is the overall , multidimensional use in the air , ground , sea , space , and electromagnetic realms of the information warfare capabilities , long-range precision strike capabilities , and mobility of integrated units , creating a decisive posture involving complete space-time control of the battlefield and focused directly at the enemy 's center of gravity .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
The reason is : in a foreseeable period to come , there will be no major change in the international strategic structure , and there will be no major breakthrough in Sino-US relations .  The United States will not make substantive adjustment of its strategy against China . Taiwan 's status as a chessman in the global strategy of the United States will not be shaken , and Taiwan 's role as a counter will not be weakened .  
The unexpected collision of US and PRC military aircraft at a point 140 km southeast of Hainan , leading to the PRC F-8 fighter plane crashing , and the US EP-3 reconnaissance plane making a forced landing at Lingshui Airbase , is a test of the crisis management ability of both the PRC and the US . It also makes it clear that the strategic partnership relationship is finished , and determines even more how the two regard each other as strategic competitors .  
In the era of information warfare , qualified senior personnel will undoubtedly become strategic resources vital to a war 's outcome , and those standing at a " commanding height " as regards qualified personnel are bound to get the upper hand in winning a victory in a war . 
However , to meet the need of its strategic objective of becoming the sole superpower dominating the world , the United States is still stubbornly sticking to the Cold War mentality and regards it as a basic method for handling and resolving international issues .  
It is precisely for the strategic needs of maintaining the party 's advanced nature from beginning to end and comprehensively promoting party building and the modernization drive that Comrade Jiang Zemin , standing on the high plane of the times and history , grasping the overall situation of development at home and abroad , and summing up the experience and lessons of political party building at home and abroad , has put forward the important idea of the " three represents . "  
Intensifying coordination and cooperation and deepening the strategic partnership between China and Brazil is of vital significance to augmenting the strength of the developing countries as a whole and giving impetus to the establishment of a fair , rational new political and economic order in the world .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .  
We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
We must insist on putting the military economy in the context of the national economy and combining strategic logistical construction with local infrastructure construction .  In the construction of railroads , highway , airport , docks , telecommunications , pipelines , urban construction and other basic construction , we must take into consideration the military needs and make sure they can be taken care with little or no extra spending .  
It will soon be 100 days since Little Bush became US President , but the impression he has given observers at home and abroad is one that can not be considered as good - - one that he handles international affairs in an intransigent , conceited and obstinate manner , showing no strategic vision whatsoever .  
Fostering high-quality news talent must be a strategic mission , adopting powerful measures and concentrating our efforts to foster a large and renowned group of politically strong , professionally excellent , stylistically honest and strictly disciplined reporters , editors and translators .  
The fact that the Taiwan authorities are putting forward the dangerous strategic concept of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and attempting to " rely on arms to resist reunification " has a lot to do with the wrong signal sent by the United States to the Taiwan authorities on the question of arms sales .  
Both the " offshore decisive battle " and the " crippling battle " are ideas developed from the same strategic concept of " effective deterrence and solid defense , " but the actual intention is to internationalize the Taiwan issue , stretch the battlefield to the mainland and even the Pacific region , create the pretext for intervention by external forces , and then launch an attack first if the mainland shows signs of using military force , thereby crushing the mainland at one go .  
Most of the weapons tested were long-range attack weapons , underscoring the Taiwan military 's new " offshore decisive battle " strategic concept .  The exercise also stressed the combined tactical applications of new types of weapons , in order to test the tactics and the weapons ' technical performance and give full play to the overall combat capabilities of various types of weapons .  
During the visit , Shi Yunsheng also respectively met with Kelche , chief of staff the French armed forces ; Le Chiavez , the French defense minister 's foreign affairs adviser ; and others .  He visited the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle , a La Fayette-class frigate equipped with guided missiles , and a strategic missile nuclear submarine - - which are the French Navy 's latest vessels , and France 's naval college .  
US President George W . Bush had made clear long before during his election campaign : China and the United States are not " strategic partners " but " strategic competitors . "  Soon after taking office , George W . Bush handled a mid-air collision incident involving a US reconnaissance aircraft and a Chinese fighter plane by persisting in being unreasonable and acting shamelessly , which has fully laid bare his hegemonistic face and sent the Sino-US relations downhill by a large margin .  
To smoothly accomplish the Tenth Five-Year Plan , achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and basically realizing socialist modernization in the middle of this century is the glorious and arduous historic mission for the working class and the broad working masses in our country .  
Putin emphasized : President Jiang Zemin 's visit to Russia is a major event in Russian-Chinese relations this year ; and it has extremely important practical and historical significance .  I am very delighted to be able to have a thorough exchange of views with President Jiang on ways to continuously enrich and deepen the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries , and to promote and strengthen bilateral cooperation in world affairs in the coming century .  
4 ) From the strategic level of building armed forces with better overall quality , they have established a system for training noncommissioned officers - - a system that has different levels , educational systems , and forms of training for improving the troops ' combat effectiveness .  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
An important mission in warfare research is to study new rules for commanding war in light of changes in the form of warfare , with special emphasis on the way operational guidelines and strategic military operations are prepared and executed .  
It is essential that strategic studies cater to the objective requirements of future military struggles and involve planning for building up military strength , with special emphasis on putting forward overall requirements for promoting rapid progress in building up military strength .  
As the strategic turning point in China strategy , 1989 , the year when the Soviet Union broke up and the cold war ended [ as received ] , completely changed the status of US global strategy : Its powerful opponent collapsed overnight , and the United States , which was in the most favorable situation , very quickly started to change its China policy from " soft " to " pushing for change . "  
Of more than 10 strategic principles , the US authorities determined on measures for subverting China in various fields of social life including the political , economic , diplomatic , military , trade , cultural , and educational fields .  
In the 10 years starting in 1990 and continuing through the next 10 years , in 20 years of strategic operations , the US Government has already made and will continue to make comprehensive use of the strategy of " win without fighting " and " win through fighting " in a planned , premeditated , and measured way to speed up political , economic , and cultural evolution in China , and achieve at an early date its strategic goals of uprooting communist ideology , weakening Chinese national consciousness , and splitting the PRC setup .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
He stressed : We highly value the development of Sino-US ties .  We propose : Sino-US ties should be dealt with from a strategic and long-term perspective , and the differences between the two countries handled in a proper way .  China and the United States should maintain and develop healthy and stable bilateral ties based on the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the norms governing international ties so as to benefit the people of the two countries .  
If the NMD plan were implemented , it would shatter global strategic balance and stability , damage mutual trust and cooperation among the world 's great nations , hinder international efforts to reduce and halt the spread of armaments , and touch off a new arms race .  
In the past more than 100 days , it not only announced the withdrawal from the " Kyoto Protocol " aimed at reducing the greenhouse gas release , but also decided to break the binding force of the " Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty " it signed before and deploy the national missile defense system that will break the global strategic stability .  
Improving and developing relations with the United States will not only enable India to win more strategic initiatives when dealing with other big powers , and create a more favorable international and peripheral security environment , but will also enable India to step into the world 's political and diplomatic arena with giant strides in the new century , thus fulfilling its " dream of being a big power . "  
the development of enterprises in the war industry will promote the development of the US economy ; the building of the super shield will guarantee the United States ' absolute security and offset the nuclear deterring capacity of other nuclear states and shake off the binding of the anti-missile treaty , thus leading to the establishment of a new world security system with the United States at the center .  All these factors were included in the strategic consideration of the United States .  
Guam is located in the southern extreme of the Pacific Ocean 's Mariana Island Chain . The strategic function Guam as a forward deployment and support base for the United State military is increasing by the day .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
Such achievements have made an important contribution to the successful implementation of " the 9th five-year " plan in our region and the basic realization of developmental goals established at the third Tibet Work Forum set forth by the central authorities .  They have also created favorable conditions for carrying out the strategic goal of a leap forward in economic and social development in our region during the new period .  
It is secondary whether the Sino-US " constructive strategic cooperative partnership " can be maintained .  However , it is very dangerous and unwise for the new US government to regard China as its imaginary enemy , to shift its strategic focus to Asia , even to attempt to team up with Russia to punish China , and to regard and use the issue of China 's eventual reunification as a card to obstruct China . Almost all the experts well-versed with China issues disagree with Bush Jr . '  
International security strategy experts analyzed : The space force that Russia is forming at an accelerated pace will be a strong arm and sharp weapon for Russia to deal with the " space warfare " of the 21st century and ensure national strategic security ; what is more , is a " powerful " move to counter the United States ' NMD .  
The US strategic adjustment is a new round of expansion under the conditions of the development of the political , economic , and military situation in the world and the necessary result of further consolidating the US position of being the sole superpower in the new century .  The defense group of the Bush administration has a strong color of " Cold War fighter " .  The essence of his " new pragmatism " is to use the strong power of the United States as basis to maximize its national interests .  
Local governments at all levels including their party committees and departments and the party organization at all levels in the military have made many effective contributions to the appropriate resettlement of demobilized military cadres and reform in that resettlement .  They have effectively ensured the smooth implementation of the Party Central Committee 's strategic decision to cut military forces by 500,000 , enhanced the construction of quality in the military , accelerated national economic development and strengthened the social stability as a whole .  
We should accurately determine and promptly adjust the stress of preventing job-related crimes according to the party and state 's major measures and strategic plans for reform and development in the period , the situation in the occurrence of cases and crimes , social hot spots , problems about which the masses complain strongly , and symptomatic and tendentious issues ; we should find the right places to penetrate and open a breach in work , open work fields , strengthen our initiative in work , and achieve better actual results .  
According to foreign reports , in order to realize this strategic objective , the Indian navy has already worked out an explicit plan : Around 2012 , Indian 's fighting force at sea will be formed by large and medium-sized more-advanced fighting vessels including three aircraft carriers and about 20 submarines with a total naval force of more than 100,000 troops .  
Since last year , Japan and India have constantly strengthened their cooperation in military and other fields , established a partnership relationship , conducted many joint military exercises , jointly cracked down on those pirates threatening Japan 's energy passage at sea , and weakened the strategic pressures brought about by China to Japan at sea . 
The third battle : Naval and air troops crossed beaches for landing .  Paratroops occupied strategic forts while naval and air troops and the Second Artillery Corps used strong firepower to support the attack and prevent foreign troops from eliminating mines , blocking seas , and entering the Taiwan region to join the remaining pro-Taiwan independence forces for military counterattacks .  
After comprehensively completing a project aimed at integrating an " air network " information system with a " ground network " information system , which is being relentlessly pursued by the US Government , the US strategic early warning system is expected to have plugged up all its loopholes , and by that time , the United States is likely to become the most perilous source of war in its capacity as the sole space-dominating power . 
Berger was Clinton 's military advisor on foreign affairs and security questions , and was a motivating force for the United States and China developing " relations of strategic partners " .  At present , he still insists that " based on the United States ' principles of democracy and national security , the government is obligated to continue to carry out policies to maintain contact with China in principle " .  
US domestic and foreign policies will definitely have a tremendous effect on the world because of the United States ' superpower status in the world .  In particular , the readjustment of US military strategy will not be limited to US security only .  We can see that the political scheme and economic needs from that readjustment will have a major impact on the international political structure and strategic environment of the entire 21st century .  
The strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia has continued to deepen in the new century .  This not only is in line with the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples but also conducive to promoting the process of a multi-polar world and to building a new , just , and rational international political and economic order .  
In carrying out ideological and political education in the military , it is necessary to implement the strategic policy for the new period and to closely center on the requirements of military struggle , working to provide sustained , adequate spiritual motive force for " being able to win " .  
It is necessary to rectify guiding thinking on education , to set education objectives , to arrange education contents , and to improve the education system on the basis of closely centering on the implementation of the military strategic policy for the new period , so as to form an education mechanism suited for prevailing in contemporary warfare and to ensure that the military is capable of accomplishing the sacred mission of resisting aggression and maintaining the country 's unity and territorial integrity .  
For example , they are in favor of safeguarding and abiding by the 1992 " Anti-Ballistic Treaty " that forms the cornerstone for strategic stability and the foundation for the reduction of strategic offensive weapons , and are opposed to the deployment of closed theater missile defense systems by blocs of countries in the Asia-Pacific region .  They also support the initiative to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Asia , and support the efforts of and leading role played by the United Nations in the settlement of conflicts in Afghanistan and other issues .  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
Any practice of weakening the integrity and effectiveness of the treaty , no matter what excuse is used , will seriously damage the global strategic stability , harm the mutual trust between various countries , and produce an extensive and far-reaching negative impact on the international peace and security and on the process of multilateral disarmament and arms control .  
Quite a few serving generals , and retired generals who have just left active service , maintained : Taiwan has to develop such weapons as medium-range missiles for the sake of strategic deterrent , even if such missiles are armed with no nuclear warheads .  They stated : The more the mainland economy develops , the more deterrent Taiwan 's medium-range missiles will have .  
Second , we should bring the role of universities and scientific research institutes into full play , make great efforts to carry out strategic advanced technology research and creative and basic research .  We should enhance our sustained innovation capability in science and technology .  We should strive to realize rapid development in technology in the domain that we have relative advantages or in the domain that is strategically important .  
In particular , in the 20 years since reform and opening up , the level of productive forces in China has ascended one stage after another , the socialist market economic system was initially established , the omnidirectional format for opening up to the outside world was basically formed , the economy and social areas developed , and China had already realized the first two strategic objectives in modernization construction .  China had also begun to enter full establishment of a well-off society , accelerating and pushing forward socialist modernization construction onto a new level .  
The overall standard of living has already reached a well-off level and China now has a considerable group of wealthy people .  The objective for the second strategic step of socialist modernization has been realized in a general fashion .  
We must closely seize upon the excellent opportunity for strategic implementation of great western expansion and a stable social situation in Tibet , aim for prosperity , progress and long-term stability in Tibet , focus our energy on solving major issues concerning the overall development and stability of Tibet , promote Tibet 's economy from one marked by accelerating progress to one marked by leaps and bounds development , and promote Tibet 's social situation from one of basic stability to one of long-term stability .  
Now , we have adopted the basic economic system under which public ownership plays a dominant role in the national economy while other forms of ownership develop side by side .  We are shaping a socialist market economy and introducing strategic adjustments to the economic structure .  Consequently some workers have changed their jobs .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .  
The participating comrades unanimously held that , showing great foresight and having far-reaching significance , General Secretary Jiang Zemin speech is a brilliant Marxist document and a political manifesto of the Chinese communists facing the 21st century .  It has strong political , theoretical , ideological , and strategic nature and is highly relevant .  
For the first time , it gives a systematical reply to a series of basic questions concerning the development course of socialism , development stage of socialism , fundamental tasks of socialism , development driving forces , external conditions , political guarantees , strategic steps , the party 's leadership , the reliable forces , and the motherland 's reunification in China . It guides our party to formulate its basic line in the initial stage of socialism .  
requires that the entire party membership think of danger in times of peace and keep a stronger sense of crisis , guard against arrogance and rashness , continue to work hard for implementing the party 's basic line and fulfilling the party 's historical tasks .  Jiang Zemin 's speech shows a strategic foresight , provides profound ideas , gives theoretical guidance to many issues , and is another important programmatic document of our party to carry forward its cause into the future .  
and it was a programmatic document guiding us in the new millennium to comprehensively promote the party 's construction of grand new projects , and to comprehensively promote the grand cause of the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  The troops throughout the entire military must thoroughly understand the vital significance of General Secretary Jiang 's speech , make studying and implementing the speech a significant political mission and a long term strategic mission , and lose no time in firmly grasping these missions .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
She said : During the visit , President Jiang Zemin and President Putin will exchange views on a wide-range of current major and pressing regional and international issues , in order to make concerted efforts to safeguard global strategic balance and stability .  
The meeting unanimously agreed : General Secretary Jiang 's important speech is very insightful , all-embracing , rich in content , and of great significance , it has very strong political character , theoretical traits , strategic nature , and relevance .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
Second stage .  The three forces will cooperate in see crossing and landing operations , including simulated missile attacks , air assaults , night airborne raids , naval and ground forces occupying islands and launching sudden attacks , the special armed unit 's sudden attacks on ports or airports , and house-to-house fighting .  This reveals that the PLA 's island-attacking pattern has begun to change from " marine landings " into " airborne assaults . "  Under the new pattern , cracks troops rather than large numbers of troops will be sent to occupy important strategic points .  
For this reason , the United States began to reconsider China 's strength and ponder if its excessively radical policy to contain and isolate China had damaged US strategic interests and practical economic interests .  It is against this background that US Secretary of State Powell plans to visit Beijing in July and Bush is scheduled to visit China and meet with President Jiang Zemin in October , in a hope to establish constructive relations with China .  
Under the strategic plan of " a small change every year , a medium change every three years and a big change by the year 2010 " put forward by the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee , Guangzhou has devoted great efforts to the development and comprehensive improvement of its urban environment in its endeavor to provide its people with a more comfortable living environment .  
The two parties will use and perfect the mechanism for holding periodic meetings at various levels , and first of all at the highest and high levels , to hold periodic exchanges of views and coordinate their stances on bilateral relations and major and urgent international issues of common concern , so as to strengthen their strategic cooperation partnership of trust as equals .  
They point out that the establishment of the strategic partnership marked by equality and trust was a correct historical choice , and it has decisive significance for strengthening cooperation between the People 's Republic of China and the Russian Federation in all areas , for consolidating friendship between the Chinese and Russian peoples , and for building a just and rational international new order .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
After the Cold War , Chinese and Russian leaders decided to establish a new type of interstate relationship based on the five principles for peaceful coexistence out of their respective strategic needs for national construction and their common desire to work for world peace and development .  
During the talks , the Chinese and Russian heads of state have earnestly reviewed the development of Sino-Russian ties over the past 10 years .  They pointed out : Establishing a strategic cooperative partnershipthat is equal and trusting is a correct historic choice , and has decisive impacts on the following : when China and Russia strive to comprehensively strengthen cooperation , when China and Russia strive to consolidate their peoples ' friendship , and when the world strives to establish a fair and rational new international order .  
Jiang Zemin said that several years ago , China and Russia declared the establishment of strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century in accordance with changes in the international situation and proceeding from the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .  
He added : This treaty is geared toward the future , the new century , and the next generation .  The principal spirit of the treaty expounded by President Jiang at the Moscow State University is of very special significance because the Russian-China good-neighborly and friendly cooperative relationship and strategic cooperative partnership should be carried forward and developed by the younger generation .  
The treaty lays down that the principles of peaceful coexistence , mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , mutual noninterference in internal affairs , and equality and mutual benefit , are the basic norms for the long-lasting and comprehensive development of the good neighborly friendship and cooperation and the strategic cooperation partnership of equality and mutual trust between the two countries .  
After the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1991 , President Jiang Zemin and Russia 's first President Yeltsin profoundly summed up the experiences and lessons of history ; based on the strategic requirements of their countries ' national construction and development , and in accordance with the new characteristics and trends of changes in the international situation , they decided to establish a new style of interstate relationship completely different from the cold war period .  
China and Russia will further strengthen strategic cooperation , together advance the world multipolarization process and the building of a democratic , fair , and rational new economic order , and work together to preserve world peace and promote joint development , This is the objective requirement of the current development of the international situation and is also the unshirkable major responsibility of the two countries .  
Rumsfeld has indicated on numerous occasions that , although Europe 's importance to the US remains unchanged , with the break up of the Soviet Union the military threat that the US faces in Europe has been greatly reduced , and the eastward expansion of NATO has also clearly increased NATO 's strategic depth , resulting in a great improvement in the security environment of the European allies , and at present the likelihood of war breaking out on the European continent is far less than in Asia .  
While it will still take time for the United States to build NMD , its firm intention to deploy a missile defense system in pursuit of absolute military superiority is having an increasingly marked negative impact on the international strategic order .  It will undoubtedly undermine the global strategic balance , triggering a new arms race .  
Guam is about 1,500 nautical miles from the Philippines . The US deployment of massive forces at this important " strategic supporting point " reflects the strategic thinking of the new Bush administration and will be conducive to launching a long-distance precision attack against the mainland 's coastal regions by US military within 12 hours .  
Facing the US advances at every step , Beijing 's reaction in recent years was relatively low key .  This was considered by Communist China 's strategic circles as a " serious failure " of the diplomatic work .  The United States has long considered Beijing as its opponent and has made deployment of its forces beforehand , while the CPC Central Committee has not made ideological and material preparations in return .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
Ground-to-air missiles , aviation missiles , ship-to-ship missiles , anti-tank missiles , conventional missiles , offensive tactical missiles , strategic nuclear missiles , and continental strategic missiles moved through Tiananmen Square , and almost all the new missile types from China 's guided missile family made their appearances .

In the new century , China and Japan should , on the basis of the spirit of " taking a warning from history and looking forward to the future " and the principle determined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement , Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship , and Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration , continue to hold the overall bilateral relationship from strategic and historical heights , eliminate disturbances , and overcome obstacles ; and to work hard to open up a new aspect of good neighborliness , friendship , and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .

Jiang Zemin stressed : Philosophy and social science workers must engage in theoretical studies in light of actual situations .  They should pay attention to studying those important issues that have a close bearing on the situation as a whole , issues that will appear in the future , and strategic issues so that theoretical , institutional , and scientific-technological innovations will proceed vigorously .  
On 7 and 8 August , the Russian military delegation headed by Colonel General Yuri Baluyevsky , first deputy chief of Russia 's general staff , and the US military delegation headed by Douglas Feith , undersecretary of defense for policy , held a two-day meeting in the US Pentagon . At the end of the meeting , they issued a brief statement , saying that the delegations of the two countries held a " substantive discussion " on an extensive scope of issues concerning strategic stability and international security .  
While facing the overbearing offensive launched by the United States , to preserve its own national strategic and security interests , on the one hand , Russia insisted that the ABM Treaty could not be revised or abolished and indicated that if the United States deploys the national missile defense system , Russian will take corresponding countermeasures , including increasing the quantity of nuclear warheads , and even threatened to scrap other concluded treaties on reducing nuclear weapons ;  
This treaty makes long-term plans for Sino-Russian relations in the 21st century , and in particular lays down that the two parties will enduringly and comprehensively develop a strategic cooperation partnership of good neighborliness , friendship , cooperation , and trust as equals .  This treaty expresses in concentrated form the broad common interests of the two countries in bilateral relations and international affairs .  The treaty does away with the cold war mentality that interstate relations are either alliance or confrontation ;

Zhu Rongji emphasized that speeding up the perfection of the social security system is the urgent requirement of preserving social stability and consolidating and developing the current good development momentum , and is also a strategic move for achieving lasting political stability .  
As Bush said that he regarded China as a " strategic competitor " during his election campaign , Henry Kissinger pointed out : Bush 's viewpoint is just an " immature expression aimed at pleasing the conservatives and the hard-liners in the Republican Party . " A noticeable fact is that inside US political circles , there exists a hawkish camp and a dovish camp , and the influence of the two camps may change along with the changes in the domestic politics .  
Logistics support must be adapted to such circumstances in order to meet the need of frequent level changes in a joint operation .  This calls for a system in which the organs are streamlined , levels reduced , functions clearly defined , and relationship smooth so as to realize an integral operation from strategic logistics to tactical logistics .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .  
Thanks to the establishment and improvement in the socialist market economy , the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , and the diversification of the forms of public ownership and the rapid development of other non-public sectors since the implementation of the revised Trade Union Law , profound changes have been effected in economic and labor exchanges .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
The key part of the exercise is beach landing , which includes topics of anti-landing , air raids and anti-air raids , parachuting , electronic jamming and anti-jamming , satellite surveillance and tracking , blockading and anti-blockading , attacking with tactical and strategic missiles , hitting aircraft carriers , hitting invisible aircraft , hitting cruise missiles , hitting helicopters , anti-precision attacks , anti-surveillance and anti-monitoring , and so on .  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
The primary force driving Sino-US relations forward is that there are enormous common interests between the two sides on both national and global strategic issues and that these interests far outweigh the differences and contradictions between them .  
Zhang Deguang said , as a result of more than 10 years of accumulated experience , China and Russia have built a whole set of effective mechanisms for developing good neighborliness , friendship , and strategic coordination , from the periodic meetings of their heads of state and heads of government to bilateral direct contacts between counterpart departments .  These mechanisms involve various fields such as politics , economics , and science and technology , and they are being more and more perfected and standardized .

"  
In fact , the United States has never intended to make Taiwan an " independent " country in the true sense of the word .  Taiwan is a mere pawn on the US strategic chessboard and an " unsinkable aircraft carrier " deployed in the Far East Pacific region by the United States . Whether the United States will retain or abandon this pawn is determined not by its consideration of Taiwan people 's interests but solely by the consideration of its own national interests .

Deng Xiaoping first readjusted the past practice of using the social system and ideology as a line of demarcation and advocated proceeding from the national strategic interests in handling state-to-state relations , transcending the similarities and differences in social systems and ideology , giving no thought to historical resentment , refraining from engaging in ideological disputes , and developing relations with all countries in accordance with the norms of international relations .  
We are confident in and capable of maintaining the momentum of development of the national economy and various social undertakings , and we will be striving to fulfill the third-stage strategic goal as defined by Deng Xiaoping , that is , to build China into a moderately developed country by the middle of the 21st century .

The 1989 Tiananmen incident and the US media 's consistently negative reports on China have made the US people even more hostile to the CPC-led government .  This has left an irreparable crack in Sino-US relations to a great extent , and created the soil and environment for the consistently anti-China rightwing conservative forces of the United States to attack and block China .

Hu Xiaodi pointed out : A program aimed at " controlling the outer space " has been drawn up and under implementation through the political , economic , scientific and technological , and military might of a superpower , with a view to seeking unilateral military and strategic superiority .

When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
The speech was one of great foresight , profound thinking , incisive exposition , and rich content , containing many new thoughts and new viewpoints .  It constitutes an important Marxist document of strategic , overall , and farsighted nature , and it has the important significance of providing guidance on strengthening and improving the party 's ideological and political work , on comprehensively strengthening party building , and on advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Wu Shih-wen pointed out : President Chen [ Ch'en Shui-pien ] ' s idea of " fighting a decisive offshore battle " is also an army building rationale the Nationalist forces have all along upheld , which differs in no way in spirit from such a strategic thinking as " effective deterrent , tenacious defense . "  
Qian Qichen pointed out : During our talks with Albright , we stressed that whether Sino-US relations can be improved and developed and whether China and the United States can establish their constructive strategic partnership is determined by whether the United States follows the basic norms governing the international law of respecting other countries ' state sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrains from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs and truly sticks to the " one China " principle in its acts .  
The new middle-of-the-road line is a complete " Taiwan independence " theory and strategic program , its core idea is the so-called " democracy and human rights , " and its ultimate purpose and actual intention are to avert the debate over reunification and independence , solidify the foundation and strength for the " Taiwan independent " mindset , and comprehensively counter the one China principle with a new form and scale .  It is in reality a vicious conspiracy of de facto " Taiwan independence . "  
and that a US military strategic chain link from Japan in the north to Australia in the south be established and targeted on China . Taiwan is located in the central and crucial position in this military strategic chain link of the United States .  
In answering the question raised by a reporter at a news briefing held by the Foreign Ministry today , Sun Yuxi said that China thinks the missile defense plan announced by the United States is not in keeping with the trend of the times , is harmful to the international efforts dedicated to arms control and disarmament , and will produce a harmful impact on global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
Speaking of the central financial expenditure in 1999 in terms of both allocation and use , Xiang stated : Our central financial expenditure has conscientiously implemented and carried out both the strategic arrangements laid down by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision made by the Second Session of the Ninth NPC and has played a positive role in promoting sustained , rapid , or healthy national economic development ; in pressing ahead with a deep-going reform in the state-owned enterprises ; in attaining the goal of shaking off poverty ;  
Regarding the arrangement for , and use of , the central fiscal expenditure , Xiang Huaicheng said : In the area of central fiscal expenditure , we have conscientiously implemented the strategic plan of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision of the second session of the Ninth NPC .  It has played a positive role in such areas as promoting the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy ; helping state enterprises intensify their reforms ;  
He believes : If the plan for star wars is approved , the consequences of global arms race will be very serious : It will undermine existing international agreements on arms and on destruction of nuclear weapons , including international treaties banning nuclear tests , treaties on reducing strategic weapons , and agreements on controlling and stopping nuclear weapons .  
The meeting maintained that the Central Ideological and Political Work Meeting is an important meeting held at the historic moment of our party in its advance toward the new century , and also a major move of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core which adheres to the strategic principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both " for promoting the cause of reform , opening up , and modernization in a comprehensive way .  
Ding Guangen stressed in his speech that to intensify the building of spiritual civilization , we must seriously study and put into effect the gist of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech , persist in taking Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guide to study how to answer the major strategic questions that have a bearing on the overall situation of developing the party and state 's cause and the major ideological and theoretical questions that are posed in real life and followed by cadres and masses with interest ; 
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
In deploying this strategic plan , the western region must clearly understand and grasp the international and domestic economic situations , take the changing situations into consideration , adopt the appropriate measures to push their economic work forward , and use expanded opening up to give impetus to development .  
At today 's news conference held by the Foreign Ministry , Sun Yuxi , while answering a reporter 's question regarding the failure of the US missile interception test , said : The US development of the NMD system will break the global strategic equilibrium and stability , hinder the nuclear disarmament process , spoil the efforts of the international community on non-proliferation , and may trigger off another round of the arms race .  This is against the interests of all nations across the world , including the United States itself .  
Igor Rogachev said : " The development of strategic cooperative partnership with China is a fundamental principle in Russia 's foreign policy .  The principle can not be altered and has won support from major social and political power in Russia . "  
People are convinced that , under the direct push by the leaders of the two countries and with joint efforts of both sides , the strategic cooperation partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] between China and Russia will certainly be further strengthened , and the economic cooperation between the two countries will continue to develop in a stable manner .  
Reportedly , Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev will have a separate meeting with his Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian tomorrow afternoon.An authoritative figure here disclosed that the political topic of Putin 's visit to China would mainly involve international strategic security , anti-missile , and regional hot issues .  In addition , Putin 's visit to China is regarded as informing the Chinese side of Russia 's position at the G-8 Summit and relevant matters .  
The 1972 " Treaty on Restricting the Antiballistic Missile System " ( hereafter called the " ABM Treaty " for short ) still remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security and is the basis of key international agreements on reducing and restricting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao solemnly stated when briefing today on the Sino-Russian joint statement on the ABM issue that China and Russia both oppose the National Missile Defense [ NMD ] system , and appealed to the international community to continue to show serious concern regarding those countries which are vigorously developing ABM defensive systems that undermine global strategic balance and stability , and also take the necessary steps to prevent the development of this dangerous trend .  
He said , in this joint statement the two sides emphasize that the 1972 " Treaty on Limiting ABM Systems " remains the cornerstone of global strategic stability and international security , and is the basis of key international agreements reducing and limiting offensive strategic weapons and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
However , Putin 's China visit itself and his recent series of speeches on the policy toward China have clearly proven that the current Russian Government has not diminished its attention to Asia , and that it has fully affirmed and highly valued the Sino-Russian strategic partnership of cooperation , regarded China as Russia 's most important cooperative partner , and considered Sino-Russian relations the area Russia should develop on a priority basis in implementing its foreign policy .  
When receiving visiting US Secretary of Defense Cohen in Beijing recently , President Jiang Zemin spoke with him in a grave tone and with sincerity : The Chinese and US Governments and leaders should look far ahead from a high ground , be oriented to the future , grasp the general direction of Sino-US relations from a strategic height and long-term angle , and properly handle Sino-US relations on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and in the spirit of mutual respect , equality , mutual benefit , and seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
While inspecting the Urumqi-Kuitun Freeway , Ismail Amat pointed out : By standing high , seeing far , and facing up to a new century , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has made such a wise decision as to implement a strategy of developing the western regions on a large scale , this being also a strategic arrangement made by the central authorities for speeding up the development of the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities .  
strive to research and find answers for new and major strategic issues on the party and national development and major ideological and theoretical issues in practical life the cadres and people are concerned about ; bring into full play the basic role of theory in ideological and theoretical work ; and bring about theoretical progress in promoting social development and realize the value of theory in satisfying the people 's needs .  
According to incomplete statistics , at present , the China strategic guided missile troop already has more than 200 mentors with doctorate or master degrees .  Those academics from the department of engineering , a large group of national class experts , and people who are treated with special allowance by the government are emerging .  
The development of the NMD and the TMD is bound to undermine global strategic balance , lead to a new round of arms race , and produce broad , far-reaching negative impact on international peace and security , on the process of international arms control and disarmament , and on the international non-proliferation efforts .  Such developments are compromising the regional confidence-building efforts and aggravating the instability of the regional security .  
During his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov , Tang Jiaxuan said the Chinese side attaches importance to developing its strategic cooperative partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] with Russia . He spoke positively of President Putin 's recent successful visit to China and held the view that , to promote their bilateral relations , it is highly imperative for the leaders of the two countries to maintain and strengthen contacts .  
Moreover , the main direction of reform and development of state enterprises will continue to be : Introducing a standardized company system reform , bringing about diversification of enterprise investment , deepening reform of enterprise labor , personnel , and distribution systems , exploring an effective means for the management of state assets , accelerating readjustment of the economic structure , implementing strategic reorganization of enterprises , earnestly alleviating the debt burden of enterprises , and constantly improving the management level of enterprises .  
President Chen Shui-bian 's [ Chen Shui-bien 's ] idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " has not been mentioned in the report .  However , Defense Minister Wu Shih-wen emphasized in the foreword that the change of the strategic idea of the national troops to " effective deterrence and strong entrenchment " does not mean we are having an arms race with the Chinese communist troops .  
During a 16 June military review , the new leader in Taiwan put forward for the first time the strategic thinking of " fighting decisive battle outside Taiwan . " He also instructed the military to enhance its information warfare capability , develop air-to-ground missiles and other offensive weaponry , set up a special agency for the development of " space weapon system , " deploy for the first time guided missile boats to the Kinmen front , and conduct live-warhead missile launching exercise .  
It is a new form of military training adapted to the science and technology age and designed to win victory in a local war under high-tech conditions .  The mainland 's development of strategic ballistic missiles is in the direction of raising mobility , precision and warhead efficiency ; its development of tactical missiles is in the direction of increasing range , enhancing precision , raising payload and improving warhead efficiency ;  
Taiwan 's " Minister of National Defense " Wu Shih-wen said in the preface of the report : " The change of our strategic concept to effective deterrence and tenacious defense does not mean we want to engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists , " and " we hope we can proceed in an orderly way and step by step to promote the establishment of an institutionalized military mutual trust mechanism between the two sides to ensure lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait . "  
Carrying out comprehensive institutional reform is a strategic task set by the 15th CPC Congress , is urgently required by the establishment of a socialist market economic system , and is an important part of political system reform .  
Focusing on fighting a sea-crossing and landing combat , various units of the war theater carried out operations of storming strategic passes , reconnaissance across the sea , unloading of heavy equipment , comprehensive smashing of obstacles at waterfronts and beachheads , coordinated combat by various arms , and anti-blockade at sea , thus scoring glorious combat achievements and producing outstanding results .  
He said : The splendid speeches and technological exchanges made by domestic and international renowned scholars and entrepreneurs at the forum will definitely exert important and far-reaching impacts on the strategic choices by government departments and on the survival and development of enterprises in the general trends in the 21st century where information technologies incorporate and industries facilitate a coordinated development .  
At the same time , he chaired a CIS summit and visited six CIS countries .  He settled the debt , gas shipment , common border defense issues with the countries concerned and , using security and energy cooperation as cohesive power , improved Russia 's leading role in the CIS . This has further solidified Russia 's security in the adjacent region and its strategic buffer zone .  
During his visit to China last July , Putin said that further developing all-round cooperation in the economic , trade , science and technology , and military fields is one of the important direction for expanding and deepening the equal , trustworthy , strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia .  
Putin 's diplomatic maneuvering of the last several months shows that in his foreign policy , he has a long-term strategic goal as well as strong consideration of the reality .  His overall foreign policy goal is defined as " ensuring national security " and " developing a good external environment for economic growth " to revitalize Russia .  
During recent years , our military 's armored force has deeply implemented the military strategic principle of the new period , established its footing on winning a victory in the local war under high-technology conditions , striven to upgrade quality , and steadily marched toward the goal of building itself into a picked , composite and efficient force .  
He expressed the hope that scientific and research personnel in general would further emancipate their thinking , intensifying reforms , enhancing their science and technology innovations in prospective , basic , and strategic areas , intensifying their efforts to do a good job of attracting , training , and employing outstanding talent , concentrating their efforts on the promotion of independent innovation , and doing an even better job in the intellectual innovation pilot project .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized : To actively promote a strategic restructuring of the economy , achieve the two fundamental changes and maintain a sustained , rapid and healthy economic development will be the main tasks of our economic development at the beginning of the new century .  
Their struggle would also bring endless disasters to humankind .  If , on the other hand , these two poles become true " constructive strategic partners " and join hands in safeguarding peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world with concerted efforts , the 21st century will have lasting peace and become the most peaceful century in modern history .  This will be the two countries ' greatest contributions to all humankind .  
Later he headed troops to give strategic chase to Kuomintang troops , liberating eastern China and many coastal islands .  After the founding of the New China , Comrade Su Yu was successively appointed deputy chief and chief of general staff of the People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] .  Proceeding from the actual conditions of the army and state and the international environment , he made many major proposals to the CMC , making important contributions to building a modern defense and army .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
The pursuit of peace and development becomes both the common aspirations of the people throughout the world and the theme of our times .  However , the unfair and irrational old order in international politics and economics has yet to undergo fundamental changes .  There is still a long way to go before the two strategic issues of peace and development are solved and a fair and equitable new international political and economic order is established .  
At the same time , the acceleration in the process of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization will provide good business development opportunities to foreign investors mainly in the following aspects .  First , China 's continued efforts to implement the principle and policy of expanding its domestic demand , and to accelerate strategic economic restructuring , will provide extensive space for foreign investments in agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , communications , raw and semi-finished materials , environmental protection , high technology , major equipment , and other fields .  
China will greatly promote the strategic readjustment of its economic structure , accelerate the computerization of the national economic and social sectors , greatly develop science , education , and cultural undertakings , step up developing such new and high technologies like information technology , biotechnology , new material technology , and advanced manufacturing technology , further step up infrastructure building in water conservancy , communications , and energy , and intensify efforts on ecological building and environmental protection .  
In their speeches , they stressed the need to unify thinking with central strategic policy decisions and to be more aware of politics , the overall situation , and responsibility .  In line with the unified arrangement of the party Central Committee and the State Council , we should conscientiously make plans , work in a down-to-earth manner , avoid practicing formalism , and realistically do a good job of guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm and creativeness of the broad masses of the cadres and the people .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that at their meeting on the sidelines of the UN Millennium Summit not long ago , President Castro and President Jiang Zemin put forward a conception for the further development of bilateral relations from a strategic viewpoint , thus giving a strong push for the continuous development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries on a new level in the new century .  
He has demanded that the Taiwan armed forces establish the strategic idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and develop offensive weapons such as air-to-ground missiles , based on the notion of " repelling the enemy on the opposite shore " ; and for the first time Jinmen was included in the " Wan An exercise " on 16 August .  
He has demanded that the Taiwan armed forces establish the strategic idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and develop offensive weapons such as air-to-ground missiles , based on the notion of " repelling the enemy on the opposite shore " ; and for the first time Jinmen was included in the " Wan An exercise " on 16 August .  
He said : Russia and China 's decision to establish a strategic cooperative partnership [ zhan lue xie zuo huo ban guan xi ] has been a historic and correct one in the interest of both countries .  It is conducive to regional and global peace and stability as well as to progress towards a multi-polar world .  
In addition , since Taiwan lacks sufficient offensive weapons , and sufficient ground-to-ground missiles ( they only have the " Ching Feng " ground-to-ground missile developed by Taiwan itself , which is limited in numbers and range ) , they can not pose a strategic threat to the mainland , and are thus in a passive situation , and this has also weakened Taiwan 's defensive capability ; thus , after war breaks out in the Taiwan strait , the mainland will have sufficient offensive capability to break through the Taiwan defensive system .  
We may say that the past five years had no match in history in terms of the arduous tasks of reform and construction , the complicated situation and the huge successes scored .  We have achieved the second step of the strategic objective of modernization , namely , quadrupling the per-capita gross national product by the year 2000 , basically eliminating poverty and achieving a relatively comfortable standard of living , and accelerating the establishment of the modern enterprise system and bringing about the beginning a socialist market economy .  
At this critical juncture , when China is moving from the 20th century toward the 21st century , we must make material progress and cultural and ideological progress a uniform goal to strive for , unfailingly insisting on concentrating on both aspects .  We must put comprehensive social development in a strategic position , achieving the mutually-coordinated and sustainable development of the economy and society .  
Under the wise decision-making of the Party Central Committee , in the midst of a complex and ever-changing international situation , we have further established and unified a series of important national strategic relations , improving China 's international status .  
It was precisely at this extraordinary time and in a domestic and foreign environment of unprecedented complexity that , by relying on the concerted efforts of the entire people to overcome various difficulties , we still accomplished the " 9th Five-Year " plan successfully , ensuring the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the national economy and comprehensively accomplishing the second strategic step in the drive to modernization .  
The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting a few days ago to conscientiously study the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech on the grand western development , stressing that the propaganda , ideological , and cultural fronts should resolutely carry out the strategic arrangements of the central authorities , show concern for the grand development , conduct propaganda on the grand development , give support to the grand development , stress political awareness , concentrate energies on implementation , bring real drive into full play , and do practical things for the grand western development .  
The foreign ministers of the two countries spoken highly of the bilateral relations between China and Brazil ; and pledged to make further efforts to strengthen the cooperation between the two countries in the political , economic , and scientific and technological fields , especially in the field of high technologies , to step up coordination and cooperation in international affairs , and to constantly enrich the contents of the strategic partnership between the two countries .  
He pointed out that the fact that Comrade Jiang Zemin had repeatedly emphasized the utmost importance of strengthening party building and the development of personnel of high caliber fully shows that whether in ensuring that socialist cause started by proletarian revolutionaries of the older generation can continue from generation to generation , in ensuring the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country , or in fulfilling the " three-step " strategic objective of socialist modernization , the key lies in the party and in qualified people .  
He said that in order to replace direct and specific management with macroscopic and strategic guidance , the important thing is to create a fine policy and legal environment for the healthy growth and functioning of professional and technical personnel and to establish and perfect a mechanism which allows outstanding personnel to excel .  
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
In 1997 , at the 15th CPC National Congress , Chairman Jiang Zemin declared to the whole world : Following the 1-million personnel retrenchment in the 1980s , China will further cut down the personnel size of its army by 500,000 in the next three years .  In order to implement this strategic decision made by Chairman Jiang and the party Central Committee , the PLA has readjusted the organizational establishment of its troops ; reformed its logistic support , weaponry management , and the structure of its military academies and training institutions ;  
In order to maintain the sustained , rapid , and sound development of the economy and to continue to improve the lives of more than 1.2 billion people , we must make some strategic adjustments of the economic structure , vigorously promoting reforms and opening up and innovations in science and technology , achieving an overall improvement in the quality of the national economy .  
In accordance with the long-term objective put forward at the 15th CPC National Congress , the major goal for the economic and social development of our country in the 10th Five-Year Plan period is : to maintain a relatively rapid speed in the development of the national economy , to obtain notable results in the strategic readjustment of the economic structure , to remarkably improve the quality of economic growth and efficiency , and to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP of 2000 by 2010 ;  
In accordance with the general outlook and arrangements of the 15th Party Congress regarding China 's modernization in the new century , the session proposed the main goals of endeavor in China 's economic and social development during the 10th Five-year Plan : The national economy is to maintain relatively rapid development , notable results are to be achieved in strategic restructuring of the economy , and there is to be marked improvement in the quality and returns in economic growth , so as to lay a solid foundation for the doubling of 2000 GDP by 2010 ;  
The session held that in achieving sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , it is essential to regard the improvement of economic returns as the central task and carry our strategic readjustment of the economy .  
On the basis of summing up the experience of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and soberly analyzing the domestic and international situation at the turn of the century , the fifth plenum put forward the following major objectives for economic and social development during the 10th Five-Year Plan after carefully analyzing the situation : Maintain a relatively rapid speed of economic development , make progress in strategic economic restructuring and considerably improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth , in a bid to lay a solid foundation for doubling the GDP in 2010 compared with that of 2000 ;  
The fact that such a large number of world economic magnates will assemble under the banner of developing China 's vast western region suffices to prove that the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision to develop the western region is wise , well-timed , and full of great potential .  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
summed up the great practice in more than 20 years of reform and opening up ; and from the high plane of history and breadth of the world 's scope , profoundly analyzed the opportunities and challenges China faces at the turn of the century and put forward the strategic tasks and guiding principles for China 's economic and social development in the next 5 to 10 years .  It is a programmatic document that will guide us in advancing socialist modernization .  
The " Proposals " reflects the demands of the third-step strategic objective in socialist modernization , the demands of socialist market economic development , the demands of new situations in the new century , and the interests and aspirations of the broad masses .  The entire document is filled with the spirit of emancipating minds , seeking truth from facts , exploring and innovating , and seeking pragmatism .  It has vivid characteristics of the times and is an important document on Marxism .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan period , China 's society and politics will continue to remain stable , and the socialist market economic system will be further perfected .  The economy of the people of China will continue to develop at a rapid pace , and clear successes will be evident in the strategic restructuring of economic structures .  Increases in economic quality and efficiency will be evident , and state owned enterprises will establish modern management systems and will progress greatly .  
The countries concerned should observe the treaty and other concluded legal documents on arms control and disarmament .  They should not develop or deploy the NMD system , which upsets global strategic balance and stability , nor should they assist other countries in acquiring such a system or interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and undermine their sovereignty and territorial integrity through the proliferation of sophisticated antimissile systems and technologies .  
Once the NMD system is deployed , the results in bilateral and multilateral disarmament and arms control obtained over the past several years will be destroyed in one day .  With the destruction of global strategic stability , unilateralism in international relations will increase .  There will be more unstable factors in both global and regional security .  
In his speech , Wen Jiabao stressed that the fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee , which has just ended , examined and adopted the " Proposal of the CPC Central Committee on the Formulation of the Tenth Five-Year Plan for the National Economic and Social Development " and put forth the strategic mission and guiding principle for China 's economic and social development to march toward the new century , which is a programmatic document guiding our endeavor in the socialist modernization .  
The " proposal " is based on the overall situation and focused on the future ; it is truthful and realistic and attaches great importance to innovation ; with the distinct characteristics of the times , it is forward-looking , purposeful , and of a strategic character .  
New ideas are needed for development . we must persist in advancing strategic economic restructuring , promote the two fundamental shifts , deepen reform , and open wider to the outside world ; we must promote technological innovation and industrial upgrading , carry out the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region , and solve problems accompanying our advance through development .  
Jiang Chunyun pointed out : Implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region is an inevitable requirement for ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy and fulfilling the third-step strategic objective of the country 's modernization drive .  
The fifth plenary session of the 15th party central committee , which was held not long ago , regarded the development of human resources as an important strategic task that determines the future of China , and explicitly proposed that " qualified personnel are the most valuable resources , " and the " leading personnel are the crucial elements that carry on past traditions and open up a way to forge ahead into the future . "  
regard the work of bringing about an industrialized agricultural operation as a major measure for speeding up the strategic structural adjustment of agriculture and the rural economy , and for promoting the modernization of agriculture ; take bold steps in practice and make active explorations ; and strive to enhance the level of the country 's industrialized agricultural operation .  
Rogachev said : Russia 's position is one of firmly exploring all forms of flexible ways and means for building a stronger material foundation for consolidating the strategic partnership and ensuring its long-term nature and stability in accordance with the status of the two countries ' market economy and their respective international obligations so that the bilateral economic and trade cooperation will have the active support from their respective countries . 
Both sides held that the strategic talks , being pragmatic , earnest , positive , and friendly , promoted mutual understanding and attained the desired purpose .  
It is said that titanic schorl is one of the ores that are in seriously short supply in China , as the current annual output is only 3,000 to 4,000 metric tons .  It is listed by the relevant department as one of the 14 strategic reserve ores for which China is heavily dependent on foreign resources .  Titanic schorl can be used to extract the metal titanium .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the ideas of " how to understand four things " put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin involve important theoretical and strategic issues of the contemporary general trends of development of China and the world , are basic questions that must be correctly answered by means of theoretical research on scientific socialism , and are also issues of ideological understanding at a deeper level which the broad masses of party members and cadres are concerned about .  
The regular meeting of the general staff departments of the Chinese and Russian armed forces to discuss international and regional situations and issues of common interest is an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership and a specific embodiment of the further development of relations between the two armed forces , and it will help both sides not only strengthen mutual understanding and trust but also coordinate their stand and strengthen their cooperation in international affairs .  
They should fully recognize the importance of properly carrying out " three stresses " education in colleges and universities in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " and from the strategic vantage point of making ideological , political , and organizational preparations for the challenges in the new century .  They should make active efforts to do a good job in every stage of their work , continuously raise their ideological awareness , and make genuine efforts to prevent and overcome jaded and lackadaisical feelings .  
With the concerted efforts of the leaders , governments , and people of the two countries , the Sino-US relations have maintained the momentum of healthy and steady development in recent years .  As a result , the two sides have reached a consensus on establishing a constructive strategic partnership , come to an agreement on China 's entry into the WTO , and resolved the problem of granting the permanent normal trade relations status to China .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi expressed here today his appreciation for the efforts of US President Clinton in improving Sino-US ties during his presidency over the past eight years .  He said : So long as both Chinese and US leaders , especially US leaders , are able to regard Sino-US ties with a long-term and strategic viewpoint , to abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques , and to fully understand the basic common interests between China and the United States , Sino-US ties will healthily and steadily advance forward in the new century .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
He said : The Ninth Five-Year Plan was one of the best executed five-year plans .  It was through the implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan that China accomplished the strategic goal for the second stage of its modernization and the overall living standard of the people reached the level of moderate prosperity , thus laying a solid foundation for the implementation of the strategic plans for the third stage .  
Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's strategic thinking characterized by its broad and long-term view , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , established Shanghai 's strategic position and asked the municipality to be turned into an international economic , financial , and trade center as soon as possible .  
This " give-and-take " strategic readjustment became the mainline of the " Eighth Five-year Plan , " and during the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , this was combined with the overall readjustment of the setup of the municipality 's productive forces to promote the continuous " upgrading " of the standard and the quality of the secondary and tertiary industries .  
Li Lanqing expressed deep belief that full advancement of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is not only in keeping with the basic interests of the two countries and their people , but is also beneficial to regional and global peace and stability .  
The Chongqing Municipality has proposed to make efforts to do well four major things like the task of migrating people out of the Three Gorges Reservoir areas , the reform and development of state-owned enterprises , the development of rural economy , and the construction of ecological environments , take an active part in the Big West Development , constantly strengthen its economic strength and city functions , and strive to realize the strategic objective of " building Chongqing into an economic center in the upper reaches of the Changjiang River . "  
Sichuan has actively implemented the strategic policy decisions of the central authorities regarding the " great development of the western region , " and has put forth the overall working idea of building Sichuan - - with 10 years of struggle - - into an economic powerhouse province in China 's western region and an ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , of harmoniously developing the economy and society , and of realizing new strides . 
The " 10th Five-Year " plan has imposed further demands on reform of the SOEs , as they must accomplish a strategic readjustment of their position in the national economy .  There are things they should engage in , and things they should n't .  Namely , they should pull out of those competitive areas which are not suited to SOE development , while those SOEs which it is necessary to retain should achieve the diversification of entities investing in them through the form of joint-stock companies , establishing a modern enterprise system and improving their economic management .  
It calls for improving the capability for sustained scientific and technological innovation , achieving a technological leap forward , and continuously providing powerful technological support for the strategic economic restructuring and the modernization drive .  
All localities must persist in buying the peasants ' surplus grain at protected open prices , attach great importance to lightening the peasants ' burdens , vigorously promote the strategic restructuring of agriculture and rural economy , actively and steadily develop small towns , and achieve relatively rapid increase of peasant incomes.We must push the major development of west China in a thoroughly sound way .  The western development is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee for taking on the overall situation and facing the new century .  
The framework agreed in 1997 by the two heads of state on " working to build a constructive strategic partnership geared to the 21st century " represented an effort by the leaders of the two countries in hoping to jump out of the set pattern of history and plan an unprecedented new-style cooperative relationship between two major powers with different civilizations , social systems , and different stages of economic development , and its strategic significance can not be underestimated .  
I sincerely hope that all of you here as well as all investors in Hong Kong will ride the east wind of China 's modernization as it makes big strides forward toward the third strategic objective , ride the east wind of the development of west China , ride the east wind of China 's imminent entry into the WTO , and ride the east wind of Hong Kong 's continued prosperity and stability ; overcome the difficulties that lie ahead ;  
This kind of powerful strategic goal , together with the relatively rigid policy of President-elect George W . Bush towards China , surely helps one feel very confident in the resolve of the United States to protect Taiwan . It also stabilizes the gradual drift towards instability among military powers and national powers across the straits .  Because of this , the judgment of some people regarding the future of Taiwan now appears to be excessively pessimistic .  
Experiences leading to the gratifying situation in the air force 's flight safety record are varied and can chiefly be summed up as follows .  First , all air force units always insist on applying the new period 's military strategic thinking in managing things , placing military training at the center of all work , giving priority to flight training arrangements , and well maintaining continuity in flight and in training course .  Second is persistence in subjecting units to tough and strict training .  
To improve the quality of workers and provide effective human resources support for the sustained and fast development of the national economy is a strategic task for the labor security cause .  Zhang Zuoji said : For some time to come , it is necessary to regard the vocational qualification certificate system as the point of breakthrough for the improvement of the quality of workers and popularize the vocational qualification certificate system in a comprehensive way .  
The plenary session defined three major tasks that the CPC must undertake as it heads into the new century - - that is , continuing with the modernization drive , accomplishing reunification of the motherland , and safeguarding world peace and promoting common development .  It was a historic , strategic policy decision on the part of the CPC to have included among the three major tasks the accomplishment of reunification of the motherland .  
We must vigorously push forward the strategic readjustment of the agriculture structure and the rural economic structure , gear agriculture and the rural economy to the market , rely on science and technology , focus on raising the quality of agriculture products , optimize regional distribution , carry out processing and conversion , and develop industrial management of agriculture .  
The two sides stressed that the friendly cooperative treaty should be based on safeguarding the security and interests of the two countries and their peoples , and that the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership should be substantiated on the political , economic , and military fronts . 
It is readily apparent that the new " cross-strait " structure of " eternal peace " and " political union " that the Taiwanese leader calls for is a " security structure " with a guaranteed " independent standing . "  Under an international strategic position , foreign powers would use this structure to " contain ( China 's ) surroundings " and extend Taiwan a protective umbrella .  
Thus , in order to achieve the strategic target for the new century , Hubei can not adopt the " strategy of following others " in its choice of development model .  Instead , it must adopt a strategy of developing by leaps and bounds .  What this means is that in the process of industrialization , it must persist in using an information-based economy to boost industrialization , fully bring into play its advantage in having a late start , and rely on technological leaps to boost leaps in social productivity from a high starting point .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
We must guide and organize high-tech research and development in the light of the strategic demands of national development and the demands of the market , and effectively promote scientific and technological innovation with a view to achieving our own intellectual property rights in order to develop a high-tech industry that is capable of competing in the international market and developing by leaps and bounds .  
Guided by theoretical study , we should step up study of the international strategic situation and the characteristics and law of military management under the high-technology local war conditions and the new situations ; we should actively organize and coordinate military organs , military academies , scientific research units , and the troops , to systematically study crucial and difficult problems .  
The Golan Heights has an area of 1,860 square km .  It is situated in southwestern Syria and adjacent to Lebanon , Israel , and Jordan . Its terrain is dangerously steep .  It overlooks the Galilee Valley of Israel to the west and guards the passageway into Damascus to the east .  With an abundant water supply , the heights ' strategic position is very important .  
It is necessary to actively study the regularity in the operation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new stage , adopt effective measures according to the local conditions to develop the market-oriented rural economy by bring local advantages into play , raising the quality and efficiency of farming production in suburban areas , and developing agriculture in scope and in depth .  Thus income can be increased in the process of strategic economic restructuring .  
Wu Bangguo indicated : At present , China has already shaken off the adverse influences of the Asian financial crisis , a smooth progress has been registered in the country 's strategic readjustments to its economic structure , the three-year target for the reform and the difficulty-relief work of state enterprises has been basically fulfilled , and China 's national economic development has taken a major turn for the better and has maintained the momentum of a fairly fast growth .  
Taking into consideration the country 's overall interest , basing on its correct assessment of the situation , and showing its keen determination to carry out reform , the party 's leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has put forward strategic tasks and guidelines for China 's economic and social development in the coming five to 10 years , thus drawing up a magnificent blueprint for China 's development in the new century from the high plane of history and from the angle of the entire world .  
In conducting agricultural technological work , we must adapt ourselves to the situation , change our concepts , vigorously push forward the new agricultural scientific and technological revolution around the central task of the agricultural and rural strategic economic structural adjustment in the new stage and the basic objective of increasing peasants ' income , expedite the all-round infiltration of modern science and technology into agriculture , and repeatedly elevate the entire level of agricultural science and technology to bring about the fundamental change from the traditional agriculture to a modern agriculture .  
The two important documents approved by the meeting , the " Beijing Manifesto " and the " Outline for Sino-African Economic and Social Development , " comprehensively expounded the common ideas of China and Africa regarding major international issues such as establishing a new international political and economic order , determined that China and Africa will build an enduringly stable new-style strategic partnership of equality and mutual benefit , and also set down new lines of thought for Sino-African cooperation in substantive fields such as economics and trade .  
At the meeting , Zhu Rongji pointed out : In the past five years , the people of all nationalities throughout the country were united in brave advancement under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core to make great achievements in all areas , fulfill the Ninth Five-Year Plan as scheduled , and successfully achieve the second-step strategic objective of modernization in the face of complex international and domestic situations .  
The two venerable professors then acquainted Li Lanqing with their lives , work situation and , moreover , showed heartfelt happiness for the diligent implementation of the Science-Teaching-to-Prosper-the-Nation strategic direction under the leadership of the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , respect for teachers and teaching , valuing talent , the obvious achievements it has attained in the vibrant development in the cause of Chinese education , and in improving teachers work and living conditions .  
What they are pursuing is no longer a simple " Cold-War mentality , " but an " imperial strategy " of seizing the sphere of influence , and their ideological basis is narrow ideology and ultra-nationalism .  And , with the two highly destructive " poisonous spiritual arrows " directly aimed at China , a marvelous strategic sight has taken shape , in which all the major forces with great interests in the region point their strategic focus at China .  
Under such strategic positioning , the Indian military has worked out a multi-directional strategic principle of " attacking the west , resisting the north , going south , and maintaining stability internally , " which means that India should adopt a posture of vigorous offensive against Pakistan in order to defeat it once and for all ; 
India 's concept of military strategy has always been linked with the issue of territory .  Moreover , it entertains the idea of not hesitating to go to war .  For example , it has defined an offensive principle of " piecemeal encroachment of territory , internal subversion , military superiority , and strategic deterrent . "  
and the improvement in the living standard as the starting point .  It will uphold the principle of " striving for high efficiency , increasing employment opportunities , and maintaining sustained development " ; push forward the national economy and social informationization ; and speed up the process of industrialization and urbanization , thus laying a solid foundation for the three-step strategic goals .  The main targets are : maintaining sustained rapid healthy national economic development and striving for an annual GDP growth rate of 8.5 percent .  
In today 's world , innovation in science and technology has become the main motive force behind the world economic and social development and has become a strategic commanding height in international economic competition and rivalry of overall national strength .  
Second , it can spur China , through evoking national self-respect , to whip up an unprecedented space arms race thus exhausting China 's economic strength to the maximum , shifting China 's strategic goal of taking economic construction as the center , luring China into all-round competition with the United States , and finally wearing China out and forcing it onto the road traversed before by the Soviet Union .  
He said : " Running the country with virtue " and instituting an ideological and moral system adapting to the developing socialist market economy are a long-term strategic task and a huge project of systems engineering , and this calls for joint efforts by people in various circles , continuously studying new situations in practice , and summing up fresh experiences .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou emphasized yesterday that the National Unification Guidelines is a strategic and practical document based on legal principle .  Moreover , the guidelines take into account the spirit of the Constitution and current political situation in the Taiwan Strait and have played a guiding role over the last 10 years of cross-strait relations in serving as a link between the past and the future .  
First , before and after George W . Bush assumed office , he declared that the United States would promote a diplomatic policy based on a " unipolar world " and stressed the " leading position " of the United States . Meanwhile , he announced that the United States would adjust its global strategy and shift the strategic emphasis from Europe to the Middle East and Asia .  
Russia has three major weapons : strategic nuclear missiles , anti-satellite weaponry , and directional anti-missile high-energy laser and particle beam weaponry .  But Russia today does not have the money to continue to develop them .  Taking advantage of the other 's problem , the United States is setting a trap for Russia by using its NMD program to egg Russia on to develop high-expense anti-missile system , thereby causing Russia 's national economy to be bled white by huge outlay of military expenses .  
To lay a solid foundation for achieving a gross domestic product in 2010 that is double the 2000 figure , the document is expected to call for maintaining a fairly rapid pace of national economic development , achieving remarkable results in the strategic realignment of the economic structure , and achieving marked improvements in the quality of economic growth and economic returns .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
The new US Administration recently increased defense spending by a big margin and has vigorously pressed ahead its NMD [ national missile defense ] program , drawing strong denouncements from the international community .  However , a small number of countries , such as Japan , have not complained at all about the US act to dominate the world , which will spark a global arms race .  Moreover , Japan has exerted itself in cooperating with the United States in developing a strategic missile defense system .  
Zhu Rongji said in his report : The main objectives of economic and social development in the next five years are as follows - - maintain a rather fast growth rate in the national economy , achieve marked results in the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , substantially enhance the quality and efficiency of the economic growth , lay a solid foundation for doubling the 2000 gross domestic product in 2010 ;  
Through the formulation and implementation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , China will be able to better adjust its own pace of development , release the initiative of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , concentrate all efforts on the theme of " development , " and advance toward the strategic objective of building a moderately developed socialist country and enhancing the people 's living standards so that they are able to lead a fairly comfortable life .  
Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
the Ninth Five-Year Plan raised the idea of changing the country 's economic structure and growth pattern ; while the 10th Five-Year Plan has emphasized that the country " must center its efforts around the task of improving economic efficiency , and must make strategic readjustments to its economic structure . "  Today , the quality and efficiency of China 's economic development have both been enhanced to an unprecedentedly high level .  
Deputies expressed the view one after another : With the solid foundation laid in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period and a practical program for development , the people across the country , full of confidence , will certainly be able to make ever greater and more brilliant achievements while advancing toward the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive on the new march .  
In considering the strategic arrangements and important measures for the reform , opening up , and modernization , it is imperative to regard development as the theme , structural adjustment as the principal line , the reform and opening up and advancement in science and technology as the driving forces , and the improvement of the people 's living standard as the fundamental point of departure .  
The ' outline ' of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " is predicated on the overall situation , long-term and fundamental needs and on the basis of analyzing domestic and foreign environmental factors and making scientific determinations , the plan takes a fresh look at the direction , goals , and path of our nation 's social and economic development in the new century - - our nation has begun to move towards the strategic goal of the third step .  
They should lay special emphasis on the study of the international strategic situation , high-tech local warfare , and the law of military management characteristic of the new situation so as to keep enhancing the scientific nature and effectiveness of their work of PLA construction and preparedness for military struggles .  
The deputies held that in consolidating the achievements of state enterprise reforms it is essential to adopt methods such as establishing a modern enterprise system , carrying out strategic readjustment of the pattern of state-owned economy , reorganizing the state enterprises , and speeding up technical progress in the enterprises in order to resolve structural obstacles in the state enterprises , foster the enterprises ' capability in technical and system innovation , and establish as soon as possible a social security setup commensurate with the state enterprise reforms .  
Kim Tae-chung maintained that the DPRK Government 's commitment to improve relations with the United States and the ROK is based on sincerity and is a " strategic choice " made through careful and deep consideration .  But , he added , the relaxed situation in the Korean Peninsula is very weak , just like a fleeting opportunity .  
If we want to occupy a position in the highly competitive field of advanced science and high technology and to put ourselves in a favorable position in global economic development , we must pay great attention to the issue of intellectual property rights , looking at it from a strategic angle , " said Xu Guanhua , CPPCC member and newly appointed minister of science and technology .  
" Independent intellectual property rights must be concentrated on high-tech fields with strategic significance .  We must endeavor to make breakthroughs in some crucial technological fields that have a bearing on the economic lifeline and national security . "  
I believe that in the course of implementing the Tenth Five-Year Plan and realizing the third strategic objective in the new century , minority areas can seize the opportunity afforded by the great development of the west to speed up economic development and social progress and raise the living standard of the minority nationalities so as to gradually bring about the common development and joint prosperity of all nationalities . "  
Like the whole country , over the past five years , Jiangsu scored brilliant achievements in its economic and social development , and on the whole the province completely attained the goal of enabling its people to live a relatively comfortable life with the county as a unit and realized a historical leap from just having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively comfortable life .  Southern Jiangsu and some areas along the Chang Jiang have started ahead of time to stride toward the third-step strategic goals .  
The people of all ethnic groups throughout the country , under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continued to advance along the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , successfully fulfilled the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development , achieved the second-step strategic objective of the modernization drive , and laid a good foundation for advancing toward the third-step strategic objective .  
Under such circumstances , if Sichuan fails to develop itself or fails to develop itself fast enough , it will surely fall behind .  In view of this , we must firmly grasp the main line of conducting strategic economic restructuring ; and must ensure that the province 's GDP can total 589 billion yuan by 2005 , growing at an average annual rate of 8 percent and above .  
This session held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , upheld the party 's basic line , comprehensively implemented the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee , and discussed the major strategic , macro , and policy issues facing China in entering a new stage of development in comprehensively building a comfortably well-off society and speeding up socialist modernization .  
The NPC deputies said : The " Outline " fully embodies the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Congress . It has a clear guiding ideology ; shows pronounced characteristics of the times ; sets practical and feasible targets ; thoroughly analyzes a series of strategic , macro , and policy issues concerning China 's national economic and social development ; and sets forth measures to deal with those issues .  This is a good outline program for seeking truth , attending to practical matters , and elevating the morale .  
Looking ahead , we have set our goals clearly : During the period under the 10th Five-Year Plan , we shall maintain a relatively fast pace of development of the national economy , achieve marked results in the strategic adjustment to the economic structure , significantly improve the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and lay a solid foundation for the doubling of the 2000 GDP by 2010 ;  
Since the second half of 1998 , under the leadership of the party central committee and the State Council , the State Development Planning Commission started to organize personnel to make preliminary preparations and conduct investigation and study for the formulation of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which included more than 140 special subjects totaling as many as five million words and covered such contents as the basic judgment on the domestic and international environments , the principal development targets , the basic strategic choices , the main considerations about policies , and so on .  
Positively pushing forward the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , promoting the two fundamental changes , and maintaining the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy are the main line of China 's economic development in the early years of the 21st century .  
It holds fast to the crux of China 's modernization drive at the beginning of the new century and fully embodies the global views and strategic thinking of the party central committee .  Hence , it is the basic guiding principle which we must understand and take advantage of in the future economic and social development of China .  
In the arrangement of contents , every effort has been made to reflect the requirements of the socialist market economy , and highlight its strategic , macroeconomic , and policy-related character , the spheres where the government should play a principal role , the major issues that have a bearing on the overall situation of the immediate and long-term development , the new domains and new tasks of economic and social development , as well as its operability .  
He pointed out : Taking agricultural restructuring and the increase of farmers ' income as the basic target and major task of the current agricultural and rural economic work is a correct policy decision made by the central authorities after having made a thorough analysis of the situation of agriculture and the rural economy in the new period .  Restructuring agriculture and the rural economy is not only an important way to increase farmers ' income but also a strategic measure to comprehensively improve the overall quality and efficiency of agriculture and carry out agricultural modernization .  
The Republican-led government can not blindly imitate the China policies of the Clinton administration , nor can it go back to the doctrine of " strategic partnership . "  In the US , where politics is deeply partisan , such a shift is not without justification , but in reality the new US administration will not move in the direction of the other extreme , which would mean applying Cold War thinking to an emergent China and a wholesale repudiation of the positive results gained by the China policies of the previous administration .  
It is of great and far-reaching significance for narrowing the gap between the eastern and western regions in development , accelerating the process of China 's modernization drive , achieving the third-step strategic objective in the modernization of our country , promoting the unity and progress of various nationalities , realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation , maintaining social stability , consolidating national defense , and achieving the lasting political stability of the country .  
Further expanding domestic demand will make it possible for us to have the initiative in our hands in developing the economy and maintaining sustained and steady economic growth , and this is also a strategic move in smoothly carry out the 10th Five-Year Plan and fulfilling the third-step development objective .  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal trans-shipments , and protect intellectual property rights .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
" As stated by our Secretary , it is in HKSAR 's own economic and commercial interest to maintain effective controls over strategic commodities trade because only by so doing can we ensure our free access to sophisticated goods and technologies essential for Hong Kong 's economic development , " Mr Lai said .

Apart from playing the role of channelling investments and managerial skills into the economic zones of Southern China , Hong Kong , with its strategic location and comprehensive link with the outside world , provides the main conduit for the movement of raw materials into and finished products out of the numerous factories and manufacturing plants in Southern China .

The HKCAA considered that the College had established a base from which it could develop into a degree-awarding institution .  It advised the College to enhance its academic standards further by formulating a long-term strategic plan , strengthening its quality assurance mechanism and fostering its links with its counterparts in the local academic community .  
Speaking on the control of strategic goods in Hong Kong , Mr Tsang stressed that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government , as an active and responsible player in the global economy , was fully committed to operating a law-based , transparent , stringent and internationally accepted system of controls on the trade of strategic commodities .

This will ensure that decision-makers address a wide range of consequences - economic , social and environmental - before proposals are finalised and implemented .  This will help ensure an improved quality of life for our children and future generations .  
The Group , which provided a regular forum for Customs senior staff to meet and discuss face to face with those from the industry , has proved to be an effective means in fostering the strategic partnership with the industry players , including air carriers terminal operators , express operators and freight forwarders . 
At present , China is making strategic readjustment to its economic structure and speeding up the readjustment of its industrial setup , regional structure , urban and rural structure and ownership composition .

Through years of hard work our enterprising businessmen and productive workers , together with our unique blend of public and private sector collaboration , have made Hong Kong a major hub port in the global supply chain - a hub that is endowed with a strategic location .  
We owe much of our success to the speedy , reliable and efficient service of the industry , fast-growing economic growth in the Mainland and our strategic location at the hub of the Pearl River Delta area , the largest manufacturing base in the world .  Hong Kong serves as the country 's premier port for foreign trade , handling 70% of the container cargo in southern China last year .  
On the basis that women 's rights are human rights , a strategic approach for advancement of women must bear in mind the enjoyment of all fundamental rights and freedoms including civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights and the right to development protected by the various instruments binding on the parties to the Beijing Declaration .

It is a dynamic , physical and cultural hub with world-class infrastructure , Asia 's most strategic location , and a global network of talents with an impressive record of success that can support the achievement of individual 's goal , and objectives " , he said .  
" The synergy of Hong Kong and the Mainland , based on a unique ethnic relationship and an increasing economic interaction and integration , makes the city well poised as a strategic partner for international enterprises to establish a foothold in that vast market , " Mr Leung said . 
To ensure that there is no blockage of free flow of advanced technology for legitimate commercial and research use while at the same time to prevent Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , it is necessary for Hong Kong to maintain a comprehensive and stringent control over the import and export of strategic commodities .

As for the international situation , the United States had already issued forth an official government report , and was prepared to cast aside Taiwan . As for the domestic situation , Taiwan had met up against a dire shortage of raw materials and inflation . Also , the Chinese Communists had their eyes set on Kinmen and Matsu , and were making strategic preparations to attack .  
The roots of a big tree : To place its scientific development on a firm footing in the world , Taiwan has to putting down roots in applied science first as a strategic choice . But Li Tai-feng warns that " a country that has become industrially and commercially developed only recently is liable to overemphasize practical applications and neglect basic research . "  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
On the other hand , our word " alliances , " although it is very trendy , has from start to finish remained an ideal on the level of discussion only , whereas Japan 's arbitration councils are formal organizations which can be flexibly divided and united as needs dictate . Moreover , cases of successful American strategic alliances that have divided and united as they need , have mostly been between medium - and large-scale enterprises and are thus not suitable models for our domestic medium - and small-scale businesses .  
These programs were connected to the political plan Japan had for its colony : Japanese leaders felt that Taiwan occupied an important strategic position astride the East and South China seas , and the navy was especially anxious to exert effective control over Taiwan and the Pescadores . Not only did they want to build Taiwan into a base for further military expansion , they hoped to squeeze the colony for its economic resources ( such as sugar ) to support capitalist economic development in the mother country .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
Because Taiwan occupies an important strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region , and because the US has always paid close attention to developments in the Taiwan Strait , if the PRC could not achieve a rapid and complete victory in an outright conflict , there would be numerous opportunities for foreign powers to intervene politically or militarily . This would be extremely disadvantageous to the PRC .  
Judging from the ROC national defense report , in which strategic thinking is guided by " no seeking of war but no fear of war , " it would have been be essential to respond flexibly ( i.e . at a parallel level ) to Communist China . Under such circumstances , there could have been rapid escalation to a military conflict .  
These are some of the main arguments that constitute Lin 's 1988 book China 's Nuclear Weapons Strategy , which is now available for the first time in a Taiwan translation in Lin 's recently published The Nuclear Hegemon .

Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
In order to develop a shared understanding of the problems and possible solutions , preparations for the formulation of the strategic framework include a comprehensive needs assessment on the impact of the humanitarian tragedy as well as the constraints imposed on the economic , social and developmental prospects for recovery .  
Also encourages the Fund to strengthen its work within the United Nations system at the national level through the resident coordinator system , focusing on strategic interventions and building upon its comparative advantages , in order to promote systemic change , in particular with regard to women 's political and economic empowerment ;  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
The strategic framework for Afghanistan proposes a more holistic approach by the international community , whereby the political efforts of the United Nations inform , and are informed by , the international community 's social , economic and humanitarian priorities .  
In general , it planned to focus on strategic policy formulation and the broad issues facing the common system , with a view to shaping the international civil service of the future .  
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
It follows that any sanctions should be part of the search for a long-term political settlement of the conflict , reflect the strategic goals of the entire international community , take account of the political and ' physical ' ( in terms of death and suffering among the civilian population and the destruction of material values ) cost of such actions .  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
The second point is the upholding of a just and comprehensive peace as a strategic choice and objective on the basis of the principles of the peace process , and in particular of the relevant Security Council resolutions , the principle of land for peace and the attainment of the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian people , and a reaffirmation of complete Arab solidarity with this position .  
In the debate at this session on proposals for reforming the United Nations , I would like , at the outset , to state that the strategic objective of all of the reforms envisaged must be to provide better conditions for the proper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil its founders ' dream of a lasting , democratic , responsible and credible Organization .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
While we consider counterproductive the ambition to expand the geographical frontiers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , and while we attach particular importance to efforts to remove nuclear weapons from the territory of foreign military bases in order to limit nuclear arsenals to the territory of the nuclear States , we are also ready to hold consultations on building a balanced system of relations between Belarus and that important military bloc and to work for political , military and strategic equilibrium with all our partners .  
Arab leaders have repeatedly affirmed their insistence on the peace option as a strategic and political goal , provided that it is based on the principle of land for peace , on respect for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people in particular its right to establish an independent State of its own and on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories on the basis of binding international resolutions .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Modelled , to the extent feasible , after the global guidelines for national plans of action , national or provincial guidelines for local plans should be particularly attentive to , and inclusive of , the strategic objectives of partnership , enablement , participation , capacity-building and networking .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
Urges all Governments and competent regional organizations to develop a balanced approach within the framework of comprehensive demand reduction activities , giving adequate priority to prevention , treatment , research , social reintegration and training in the context of national strategic plans to combat drug abuse ;  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
In strategic objective F . 5 , the Platform for Action calls for the elimination of occupational segregation by promoting the equal participation of women in highly skilled jobs and senior management positions , and through other measures that stimulate women 's on-the-job career development and upward mobility in the labour market , and by stimulating the diversification of occupational choices by both women and men ; women should be encouraged to take up non-traditional jobs ; and men should be encouraged to seek employment in the social sector ( para . 178 ( g ) ) .  
The best strategies explicitly recognized the contingent nature of strategic thinking and would involve an iterative process requiring continuous dialogue amongst the principal actors in order to adjust strategies to changing internal and external conditions .  
At the end of the three-year period , it would be possible to evaluate the degree to which the objectives had been attained and on that basis decide whether work on enterprise development represented an important contribution to development and therefore whether it should form part of the elements presented for ministerial consideration at UNCTAD X . In short , work on an enterprise development strategy must be based on a strategic vision , the elements of the strategy must contribute to growth and development without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability , and the strategy must be amenable to evaluation . 
In contrast , funds and programmes primarily concerned with strategic or long-term programmes and projects ( UNICEF , ITC , UNFPA ) are likely to have comparatively higher expenditure on evaluations . 2 Given the nature of humanitarian relief work , characterized by the necessity to respond to emergencies within an extremely short time-frame , and often involving substantial cash transfers to geographically remote areas , the need for forceful audit entities is apparent . 
By its own definition , Executive Outcomes is a company devoted to providing highly skilled and confidential military advisor services and to furnishing personnel , mainly military and highly skilled , to provide strategic and tactical training services in countries requiring sophisticated , effective support for the adequate control of their socio-political reality , to put an end to internal conflicts and to encourage the development of economic activities related to natural and mineral resource development .  
Privatization of enterprises partly or wholly owned by the Government and the restructuring of key strategic entities may be considered the most desirable options , particularly when a public enterprise is plagued by bad management owing to the lack of an effective system of ownership , control and budgeting , or to political pressures and corruption .  
More generally , ACC members called for complementary actions by the United Nations system , in close partnership with other actors , to support country-level efforts at relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , and agreed upon the broad elements of a common strategic framework for response to , and recovery from , crisis , as part of the system 's overall effort to help secure durable peace and pursue or restore sustainable development in countries in crisis situations .  
The emphasis that the African common position placed on poverty reduction as one of its main strategic objectives was intended to let solidarity play its role as a driving force in a sustainable development that would combine environmental preservation with the rational use of the planet \ x { e5b8 } limited resources .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .

Financial , material and technical assistance complemented by a favourable international economic environment was imperative for the realization of the strategic objectives set out in Beijing .  
While his delegation supported the reform of the Economic and Social Council , the reform process would not solve all the problems facing the international community , since institutional reforms must be complemented by a sound resource base for implementing approved strategic and financial plans .  
The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , adopted on 15 September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women , held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995 , refers to coercive economic measures in a section on strategic objectives and actions concerning women and armed conflict . 11 Under strategic objective E . 3 , paragraph 145 contains , inter alia , the following provisions regarding actions to be taken by Governments and international and regional organizations : 
To them the end of the cold war simply dictated changes in the positioning of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the taking of steps to develop new nuclear-weapon systems to meet the geopolitical requirements of the new international system .  
It also gives me pleasure to convey my warm gratitude and deep appreciation to the Secretary-General , His Excellency Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , for the positions he has taken and for his constant and devoted endeavours to advance the cause of the Palestinian people and to support its strategic choice with regard to the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in our region .

In the national programme on improving the status of women , specific objectives were put forward under the strategic thrust of bettering the scope and quality of reproductive health services , which include the following : to offer once every two years to all women preventive medical check-ups ; to make them healthier ; and to activate health advocacy , training , publicity , information dissemination and counselling for the general public .  
The research , development , deployment and proliferation of sophisticated anti _ missile systems and the revision of , or even withdrawal from , the existing disarmament treaties on which global strategic equilibrium hinges will inevitably exert an extensive negative impact on international security and stability and trigger a new round of the arms race in new areas , thereby seriously obstructing or neutralizing international efforts of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non _ proliferation .  
Given the limited staffing capacity of the Service , its operations are more reactive than proactive : a greater focus on Headquarters strategic planning and staff resource management would lead to improved service delivery and increased effectiveness in meeting operational and administrative needs in the field .  
Provision of up-to-date and relevant information on emerging regional and global issues and potential environmental threats likely to lead to potential conflicts , critical hot spots or emergency situations , as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Aside from the mobilization of domestic and international financial resources , effective implementation must be based on comprehensive strategic thinking , including a clear identification of capacities and constraints at national and international levels .  
The objectives of the report were to make UNU an integral part of the United Nations renewal process ; to explore ways by which its potential could be realized more fully as a strategic intellectual resource for the multilateral system of cooperation ; and to strengthen its adaptability to the emerging or uncharted challenges of the next century .  
In the Asia and the Pacific region , while continuing its important partnership with the Governments of each country , UNDP formed strategic partnerships with civil society organizations , NGOs , women 's groups , trade organizations , the private sector , advocates for the environment and against child labour , politicians , parliamentarians , and poor urban and rural slum communities themselves .  
During the biennium 20002001 , the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs will focus on further promoting and coordinating the development of a common principled policy on humanitarian issues and on improving the management and practice of operational and strategic coordination through the development of practical tools for field and headquarters coordination , based on lessons learned and accountability reviews .  
At the session of the ECA Conference of Ministers responsible for Economic and Social Development and Planning , held from 5 to 8 May 1997 , Ministers considered a report on the rationalization of ECA-sponsored institutions : renewal for improved service , which included an assessment of the capacities of those institutions in the context of ECAs new strategic direction and their ability to enhance the Commissions impact in the selected priority areas in which ECA has comparative advantage . 
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
In addition , a wealth of knowledge can be tapped through a participatory process and strategic partnerships forged at the common country assessment stage , not only among the United Nations system partners , including the Bretton Woods institutions , but foremost with relevant government entities , civil society , including NGOs , and the private sector , as well as other multilateral and bilateral development partners .  
Among the core principles of the Africa Partnership are : national commitment and ownership ; political action ; joint national strategic action plans ; mobilization of increased resources ; stronger regional technical platforms for action ; protection of human rights ; compassion and solidarity .  
Efforts have included a series of guides to the strategic planning process for a national response to HIV / AIDS which is a flexible tool designed to meet the dual requirement of use at a central and at a district or community level .  
In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
There is an intrinsic interrelationship between strategic offensive weapons and strategic defensive weapons , one laid down in the ABM Treaty itself in the form of a clear understanding that , given parity in terms of strategic offensive weapons , the emergence of strategic means of defence in the hands of one of the parties would be equivalent to an increase in the power of a pre _ emptive nuclear strike .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .

The IDNDR secretariat and its key partners within the International Framework of Action accepted this challenge and engaged in a structured and concerted approach towards the Yokohama follow-up , taking in the evolved strategic orientation described in paragraph 15 above and striving towards further improved interface with all relevant United Nations system sectors , as described below .  
In its exchange , the Board took the following four elements into account : the current deadlock concerning disarmament of strategic nuclear weapons made it all the more important and timely to discuss tactical nuclear weapons ; such weapons were still not being addressed by any negotiating process ; they were present in large numbers ; and they posed specific problems in terms of the doctrines concerning their use .  
Encouragement of strategic alliances between research and development institutions and potential technology users to harness the creative capabilities of the scientific communities in the development of new , proven and innovative adaptation strategies and relevant technologies suitable to the particular circumstances of small island developing States , for example , in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
These include : ( a ) a desire by State or non-State actors in conflict situations to disrupt humanitarian operations which they consider undermine their own political , strategic or military goals ; ( b ) a desire to remove actual or potential witnesses to human rights abuses and other violations of international law ; and ( c ) a general mistrust and suspicion of the motives and intentions of humanitarian organizations .  
In the post _ cold _ war world which emerged at the beginning of the present decade , the initial phase of optimism , cooperation and the adoption of major decisions in the field of world strategic policy has gradually been replaced by another in which narrow individual and often intransigent considerations on the part of the various international actors tend to prevail .  
Central America is preparing to cross the bridge between the millennia with all its republics more integrated with each other than ever before , identifying with each other in the common ideal of keeping ourselves united so that we are stronger , of playing a stellar role in the American continent , of turning the isthmus into a point of strategic convergence for world trade , and of writing ourselves into a success story that will serve as an example and touchstone to the world community .  
The international community now takes military action to deal with tragedies that only a few years ago would have left us indifferent , and yet we are still influenced by military assessments , strategic interests , regional solidarity , public opinion and the magnitude of any human rights violations .

Armenia believes that efficient and effective cooperation among the Black Sea countries will help consolidate the strategic economic potential inherent in this area , promote free trade , open roads and other means of communication and foster the welfare of peoples , thus stimulating the peaceful settlement of existing political disputes and reinforcing the independence , sovereignty and democratic development of the BSECO member States . 
It has weighty legal , political and strategic implications , since it affects one of the vital organs of the United Nations , entrusted with the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security and thereby vulnerable to the subtle interplay of the interests of the Powers , sometimes to the detriment of the very cause of maintaining international peace and security that it is supposed to promote .  
In any case , we do not believe that the deployment of a limited national missile defence system would change the basic strategic calculus underlying the ABM Treaty or be incompatible with its central purpose , which is to maintain strategic stability and enable further reductions in strategic offensive arms .  
The formation of a global information space , which is transforming information into a precious strategic resource , unquestionably opens up broad horizons for increasing the creative potential of mankind and presents favourable circumstances and conditions for the harmonious development of world civilization .  
In Europe the only military bloc left over from the cold war , under its new strategic concept , bypassed the United Nations Security Council and bombed , with the worlds most powerful and sophisticated military machinery , a weak sovereign State , the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , turning the Balkan region , which has experienced so much misery in this century , into a testing ground for its new strategy .  
Encouragement of strategic alliances between research and development institutions and potential technology users to harness the creative capabilities of the scientific communities in the development of new , proven and innovative adaptation strategies and relevant technologies suitable to the particular circumstances of small island developing States , for example , in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
Finally , the 1996 Constitution finally restores the importance of the development sector ( arts . 32 , 50 and 66 ) , thus highlighting the need for a strategic vision of Moroccos future , and for the State and the main economic and social interest groups to be equipped with tools enabling them to perceive , locate and evaluate future undertakings and arrive at a better understanding of changing conditions .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
In the statement it issued on the occasion of General Ivachov ' s visit , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Azerbaijani Republic indicated that the frank and unambiguous statements by the above-mentioned military official of the Russian Federation strengthened Azerbaijan ' s apprehension regarding the purpose of this new phase of political and military cooperation between Russia and Armenia , which had thus been lifted to a qualitatively different strategic level .  
Urban governance , which is defined by how well a population , its representatives and agents identify and deal with the major social , economic and environmental issues , is greatly improved when it is characterized by multi-stakeholder strategic planning , participatory management and the promotion of civic values .  
To help strengthen the capacities of developing countries in sustainable human development through TCDC , the Unit supported a number of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the sharing of experiences in critical areas and strengthening networking among centres of excellence .  
The two sides consider that the creation , in violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 , of a national anti-ballistic-missile defence system by one of the States which signed that Treaty will have a destructive effect on strategic stability and on the entire structure of key international agreements relating to disarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means of their delivery , and will mar prospects for achieving further progress in these directions .  
In particular , the strong State would have to be reinvented applying the decentralized model of organization of the modern global corporation , with the local states taking a proactive role in wealth creation across the territory and the national State acting as strategic leader , consensus-builder and broker between the supranational and subnational levels .  
This laid the groundwork for a strategic partnership with three major strands , one political , one economic and one cultural , educational , scientific and technical .  
In the past , the social sector was neglected and perceived as being secondary , parasitic and dependent on other sectors rather than being the source of productivity and strategic input to the economic sector .  
In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
The strategic need to narrow the gap between the local perceptions in Tokelau and the international political necessity had coloured the way in which New Zealand 's administrative responsibility had been discharged in the past decade .  
The initial promise of deep , continuous and irreversible reductions in strategic nuclear forces held out by the positive climate of the early postcoldwar years appears to be fading fast .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .

In order to maximize its impact , effective and meaningful cooperation must be established among Governments , multilateral development institutions , the donor community , the private sector , civil society , academic institutions and other relevant stakeholders in other words , strategic alliances must be created .  
These meetings must in particular consider the concepts of operation , which may bear the stamp of concepts developed by military alliances proposing deployments and tasks that can be carried out by relatively small numbers of troops only if , as their national or alliance strategic doctrines also require , they have limitless mobility , seamless cooperation between units , interoperability of the most modern equipment and a range of force multipliers in close support .

The CCA document comprises : ( a ) an initial part , made up of diagnosis and analysis : the assessment as such ; ( b ) a second part which identifies the key issues , strategic themes and entry points of a global intervention framework to be defined at a later stage ; and ( c ) a third , methodological part geared to strategic and systemic discussion of the work of the expanded groups . 
Donors and some recipient countries consulted for the present triennial comprehensive policy review confirmed the high relevance of this effect of UNDAF as a means to enhance the internal dialogue within the system on country-level cooperation38 and in the promotion of a common understanding of strategic directions . 39 Decentralization and delegation of authority by most organizations have strengthened this team-building effect . 
The most effective organizational location for the responsible entity would be within a department already charged with broad strategic and coordinating functions , such as the office of a prime minister or president , or that responsible for economic management of development planning .

It would be quite a different matter , however , if the real intentions regarding outer space were to flout the obligations of international legal instruments and to seek unilateral and absolute military and strategic superiority based on political , economic and military strength .  
This means primarily that we must have a universal political commitment based on a real international partnership involving concerted strategic approaches to help developing countries gain access to medical technology , vaccines , drugs and medicines in order to deal with this virus at affordable prices .  
We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
UNIDO should systematize successful experiences and models of sustainable industrial development , taking account of the specific conditions in each country , so that strategic alliances with other international or regional bodies could be established .  
The qualifications would specifically need to embrace : general management ( setting targets and milestones , planning strategic measures by which to achieve targets , estimating costs and design budgets , finance , implementation and control ) ; pedagogics ( theoretical formation as well as skills in the design and delivery of courses , adequate knowledge of educational and training policies and regimes ) ; substantive experience and knowledge ( trade and commerce , business and global logistics , technologies , operation , organization , economics and commercial processes of maritime transport ) .  
In addition , the methodology moves away from an expert approach , in which the communication expert produces the communication component of the programme , towards participatory communication planning , where all of the countrys team members ( from government , UNICEF , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations ) are involved in the planning , with beneficial results in terms of sharing and learning skills as well as ownership of the final product , which has in itself important implications for the implementation of the strategic communication plan developed .  
Secondly , while in the past the focus of country-level communication interventions was on the advocacy and social mobilization strategic components , in recent years there has been increasing understanding of the fact that programme communication the communication strategy specifically aimed at reaching families , communities and individuals , to facilitate informed behavioural change is a necessary strategic component and needs to be utilized in synergy with the other two , if sustained societal change is to be achieved .  
Also , the WHO Healthy Cities Programme aims to put health on the agenda of decision makers , build a strong lobby for public health , and develop holistic , popular , participatory approaches to dealing with health issues , bringing together all the development sectors in a strategic alliance in actions that can lead to a health transformation in creating healthy conditions in various physical environments .  
The main recommendation , intended to free the executive heads to focus more on strategic policy issues and to enable the system to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to major international developments , was the establishment of two high-level committees on policy and programme issues and management issues , respectively .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
Following these positive changes of the last few years that have strengthened the need for a renewed strategic vision of peace and stability throughout the world , it is necessary that international security be separated from military factors and go beyond security concepts based on nuclear weapons .  
Welcomes the ongoing dialogue between the Russian Federation and the United States of America on a new strategic framework premised on openness , mutual confidence and real opportunities for cooperation , which is of paramount importance , especially in a changing security environment , and hopes that this dialogue will successfully lead to substantial reductions in offensive nuclear forces and contribute to the maintenance of international stability ;  
Furthermore , the astronomical costs involved in developing a space-based defence system , taken together with those incurred to counter such a move , would inevitably result in heightened strategic competition and greater mutual vulnerability and further deepen the global economic crisis .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
The United Arab Emirates , which joined the NPT , the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) and the Chemical Weapons Convention ( CWC ) , in order to reinforce its international position , believes that establishing zones free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction is the key to establishing balances in international and regional strategic relations .  
The primary strategic objective of the Missions public information programme is to project , country-wide , the efforts of the military and civilian components of UNAMSIL in facilitating the peace process in Sierra Leone and the promotion of a better understanding of the mandate of the Mission and the activities of other international organizations that are operating in the country .  
We believe that , apart from unilateral and bilateral steps in the area of nuclear disarmament , the time has come to start discussions on strategic issues within the framework of multilateral mechanisms , including among the five permanent members of the Security Council , who bear special responsibility for the fate of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , the CTBT and other international agreements .  
The meeting noted ( a ) the importance of adopting poverty monitoring plans agreed by all stakeholders , with external assistance to promote the dialogue ; ( b ) the need for strategic statistical plans to be jointly developed by all stakeholders , including planners , civil society , donors and the international community ; and ( c ) that the generation of community-level statistics was facilitated through cost-sharing , for example , when local authorities funded the field costs of surveys in their locality .  
Encourages all States , the United Nations system and other actors to take advantage of the International Year of Freshwater to raise awareness of the strategic importance of achieving sustainable development and use of the freshwater resources of the world , which are essential for satisfying basic human needs , health and food production , economic and social development and the preservation of ecosystems , and to assign high priority to the formulation and implementation of action-oriented policies and programmes for the sustainable use of freshwater for social and economic purposes ;  
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation on adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
To develop local , national and regional capacities through a lasting strategic alliance among all development actors so that advantage can be taken at the local level of the potential of globalization through an exchange of experiences and best practices within and between countries , the promotion of formal and informal education for national and local leaders , and support for applied research and technological innovation at all levels .  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation in respect of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Together with the problem of anti-missile defence , the laying down in legal terms of the agreements reached on further radical , irreversible and verifiable reductions of strategic offensive weapons , in our opinion , down to the level of 1,500 to 2,200 nuclear warheads for each party is becoming particularly important under these circumstances .  
Recognizes the importance of further strengthening tripartite partnerships , and of strategically enhancing a consultative and collaborative approach to resettlement and notes that further efforts are needed to ensure more responsive and speedy processing , better identification of urgent needs , and coordination ; and urges further UNHCR efforts to ensure the integrity of the processing of the resettlement caseload and encourages States and UNHCR to continue to pursue a strategic and systematic approach to the problem of attempted fraud or other abuse ;
