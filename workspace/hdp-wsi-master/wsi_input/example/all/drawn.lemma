Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again .

I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .

Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted .

I hope the Turkish side will respond positively to my proposal , otherwise the only logical inference to be drawn will be that the massive presence of Turkish forces is not for the alleged safety of the Turkish Cypriot community , but for the perpetuation of the status quo , which , as stated in your report , has been created by military force and is sustained by military strength and which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable .

In selecting the subject matter for each series , the group tries to adhere to some specific guidelines . There are four main areas which serve as sources of stamp subjects . The first of these are themes drawn from the rich cultural heritage of Chinese tradition . Other selections are made in accordance with certain international activities such as the " International Year of the Child " , and still another criteria for selection are important current events .  
Universities in West Germany , on the other hand , are all public and , along with their good social welfare system , tuition free . Foreign students are also entitled to the same treatment .

The heart of each city serves as the focal center for a complex trans-portation network which will embrace all the suburban and outlying areas surrounding the city .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .

But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Huang Sheng-yuan had thought that his own main ideas for the design , such as the many semi-outdoor areas around the house for people to linger or chat , the sloping roofs , the use of the terrazzo-type floors distinctive of the Lanyang area , and the features drawn from traditional building experience such as the heavy wooden protective boards on the eaves and the typhoon shutters on the Windows , would fit in well with e family 's wishes .

His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .

As the fall of the Southern Tang loomed , Li remained unaware of just how near the enemy had drawn until the Song troops had Jinling totally encircled .

Years before Copernicus advanced the theory that the sun was at the center of the universe , da Vinci surmised that the earth revolved around the sun ; before Galileo improved the telescope , da Vinci had drawn designs for telescopes ; long before the dawn of the Industrial Revolution , he invented a lathe , a lifting jack , a water pump , a lift , and geared machinery ; he was also the first to use the modern plus and minus signs in mathematics .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
The head of the team , Wang Chao-yi , points out that the high quality pebbles found underground in the Kuanyin alluvial plain have been disastrous as idle farmland has drawn illegal gravel mining , and the gravel pits have then been used as landfills , leaving behind a ravaged landscape .

Unfortunately , new problems keep cropping up .  
His 1944 painting On the Way Home shows an old water buffalo , drawn with such precision that you can see its individual hairs .

I hope the Turkish side will respond positively to my proposal , otherwise the only logical inference to be drawn will be that the massive presence of Turkish forces is not for the alleged safety of the Turkish Cypriot community , but for the perpetuation of the status quo , which , as stated in your report , has been created by military force and is sustained by military strength and which the Security Council has deemed unacceptable .

The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .
