Mr . Luo of Hsinglung Beef Noodles says the choice of meat is very important : on no account should one use imported frozen beef , for imported beef does not usually arrive in Taiwan until one or two months after it has been slaughtered , so that it is not as fresh as fresh-slaughtered local beef .

Just as European countries have in recent years strongly promoted " green industries " in the environmental and cultural fields , not only improving the quality of life but creating tens of thousands of jobs as well , there are many things in Taiwan worth investing in , and sufficient profits to be had .
