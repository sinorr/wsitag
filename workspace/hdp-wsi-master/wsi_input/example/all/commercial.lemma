According to regulations by the National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau , international commercial loans indicate loans raised and borrowed by domestic institutions from financial institutions , enterprises , individual or other economic organizations abroad , and from foreign-funded financial institutions within China 's border , whose contractual repayment obligations are in foreign currency .  
Export credits , international financing leaseholds , compensation trades with foreign exchange repayment methods , overseas institution 's and individual 's foreign exchange deposits ( excluding foreign exchange deposits in banks approved for offshore operations ) , project financing , financing under trade projects over 90 days and other forms of foreign exchange loans will all be treated and managed as international commercial loans .  
The National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau clearly stipulated in the new method that , domestic institutions borrowing international commercial loans externally are only limited to : China-capital financial institutions approved by the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau to operate foreign exchange loan business ; juridical people of non-financial corporations approved by the State Department 's Authorization Department .  
Article 41 Those that violate article 13 of these regulations should be given a warning by industrial and commercial administration organs and other organs of administrative law enforcement .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
Article 44 Those that violate articles 25 , 26 , and article 27 , clause 1 , items 2 and 4 should be given a warning by the industrial and commercial administration organs and other relevant administrative law enforcement organs .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
What is more serious is that the funds had been raised at the expense of the bank 's legitimate status and reputation among the enterprises and the public in the society .  As the Beijiao Office of People 's Construction Bank of China , which should also be held responsible for the case , also sustained heavy losses , the state-owned commercial banks have naturally seen their reputation compromised to a serious extent .  
He Guoqiang , secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee , answered : Chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region .  The Chang Jiang golden waterways have linked Chongqing to both eastern and western regions .  Thus , Chongqing should serve as a bridge linking the east with the west and making them promote each other .  
While creating a model street for the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity , Hunan Road of Gulou District in Nanjing City incorporated ideological and political work as well as spiritual civilization construction into commercial enterprise management and business operation in a lively and tangible manner , producing a set of experiences in double civilizations construction and turning a shabby , cluttered , and unknown street into a golden business location , a shopping paradise , and a national model street of no fake goods in just a few years .  
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
Hong Kong itself has an excellent environment for business operations , as demonstrated in its world-class commercial and financial services , the complete and efficient trade supplementary services , the modern infrastructure facilities , and the perfect system of rule by law ;  
The meeting held : Since a similar national televised and teleconference was held last year , most central and local media units have striven to separate news-reporting activities from commercial activities , and to separate news-covering and editing personnel from commercial departments , and attained remarkable results in this regard .  
Various news propaganda units should seize opportunities , and strive to explore and establish work mechanisms which are conducive for us to uphold the party 's basic principle and fundamental nature governing journalistic work , and which suit the market economy .  They should also establish effective mechanisms to ban the practice of journalists getting personal gains in the guise of making journalistic reports so as to truly fundamentally separate news-covering , editing , and reporting activities from commercial activities .  
criminal activities are on the rise in financial computer systems and e-commerce systems ; the CIH virus , BO hacker procedures , and other harmful databases have been spread far and wide .  Some hackers at home and abroad illegally intruded into information systems in important areas of China , attacking websites and stealing state or commercial secrets .  
A People 's Bank official spoke today in Beijing on cracking down on unauthorized fund gathering activities .  He said People 's Bank would take further steps to join with the industrial and commercial as well as the judicial departments and adopt stern measures to resolutely ban , investigate , and crack down on unauthorized fund gathering activities in an effort to preserve the stability of socioeconomic order .  
Those who hand in false documents or use other deceptive means to fraudulently obtain their registration , once discovered , must be promptly punished , to the point of having their business licenses suspended , by the industrial and commercial administrative organ .  
Currently China 's foreign bond issues are regulated primarily under the pertinent State Council regulations on further strengthening the macro control over the use of international commercial loans , the State Development Planning Commission 's circular on comprehensive planned management of foreign debts , and the People 's Bank of China 's " Measures Controlling the Internal Institutions ' Issuance of Foreign Currency-based Bonds , " and so on .  There is no systematic law or regulation controlling the issuance of debt instruments overseas , and we urgently need to improve the relevant laws and regulations .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
Third , in April 1999 , the state decided to establish Xinda Assets Management Company , and in October the same year , three more assets management companies , Huarong , Changcheng , and Dongfang , were established .  They took over a considerable portion of bad assets formed by policy-related loans and those formed during the track-changing period so that the capital burdens of bad assets , which the state-owned commercial banks should write off or prepare to write off , have been lessened .  
Second , reform has led to the monetization of economy and the deepening of finance , the former distribution in kind was gradually changed to distribution in money at real market prices ( the recent reform to suspend welfare housing distribution is an example ) , and the simple and unitary financial product previously provided by commercial banks has become complex and diversified .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
In particular , the several prohibitions laid down by the central authorities must be carried out .  That is , spouses and children of leading cadres at the provincial ( ministerial ) and prefecture ( bureau ) levels are prohibited from engaging in any commercial and business activities that may cause conflicts with the public interests within the scope under the administrative jurisdiction of those leading cadres ;  
Some Arab countries even appealed for halting diplomatic , economic , and trade relations with Israel or discontinuing the process of normalizing relations with Israel .  A few days ago Oman decided to shut down its commercial representative 's office in Tel Aviv and Israel 's commercial representative 's office in Muscat ;  
Since Chen Shui-bian took office , Taiwan 's economic environment has been worsening every day .  The outflow of large amount of capital and the " shifting " of industrial and commercial enterprises one after another to other countries have consumed more than half of the economic achievements painstakingly accumulated by the Taiwan people over the past 30-plus years .  On improving the cross-strait relations , Chen Shui-bian has only given some ambiguous remarks .  
State-owned enterprises in cities must transfer all primary and secondary schools , hospitals , and other social service organizations to unified planning and management by local governments .  For some time , funding needed for this purpose will be jointly shared by both the enterprise and the government before it is gradually transferred in its entirety to the government .  Some of the organizations can be transformed into commercial operations .  
In the past five years our army has completely fulfilled the strategic task of reducing its personnel by 500,000 , totally ceased all commercial activities of the armed forces and armed police , won great victory in the fight against floods in 1998 , organized with high standards the parade for the 50th anniversary of the PRC , defended national sovereignty , security , and the unity of the motherland , and preserved social stability , and thus provided a reliable guarantee for China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
The Consulate General of the People 's Republic of China Consulate in Chicago and the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , the largest independent , non-profit international affairs organization in the Midwest , recently held a joint reception at the Chinese consulate , which was attended by nearly one-hundred persons including members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , as well as persons from political , commercial , academic and media circles . 
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
Hong Kong holds a very favorable geographical position in the Asia-Pacific region .  While facing such an important business opportunity at present , if we neglected effective operation , become less insensitive to changes in surrounding areas , and weaken the commercial and trade activities , then Hong Kong 's economic strength will not be able to display its prominent role and Hong Kong may gradually decline in the tides of the times .  
Qian Qichen said : " During my visit , I also had the chance to have extensive contact and exchange with personalities from various circles , such as the US Congress , industrial and commercial enterprises , media , ethnic Chinese community , and community of Chinese people residing in the United States . They all expressed the wish to see China and the United States friendly to each other and that the bilateral relations between the two countries can develop steadily . " 
Dai Xianglong said : Deepening the reform of wholly state-owned commercial banks is key to the reform of China 's financial system .  In the next five years or so , China 's four commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state should be reformed into modern , large-scale commercial banks that are quite competitive in international financial markets .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .  Because Taiwan 's enterprises have a special background of relationship between the government and the commercial sector , most of them are leaning toward shortsightedness for immediate gain .  Taiwan 's industry is narrow and shallow and is fundamentally insufficient to support a wide-ranging and a long-term arms race .  
As the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are expecting to further open up economic and trade exchanges on both sides of the strait , a public figure of the Taiwan authorities recently issued a thought-provoking statement that the continued rising unemployment rate on the island and the unfavorable economic situation would affect the time to relax restrictions on the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy and the extent of implementing this policy .  
We must improve the administrative structures of legal entities in state-owned commercial banks , appoint supervisory councils , establish supervisory mechanisms in accord with the market economy , set up business associations in various financial sectors , and implement prudent accounting systems in conformity with international practices .  
At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .  There is a universal call from various social circles on the Taiwan authorities to abandon the " Taiwan independence " ideology , stop political in-fighting , improve cross-strait relations , open three direct links [ postal , commercial , and air and shipping links ] , and concentrate on revitalizing the economy .  
Those ranked at the lowest level are novices , made up mostly by students .  They are considered a bit immature in terms of their skill , and they are inexperienced in warfare .  They need guidance from experienced members ; however , they are the most active and energetic ones .  They are suitable for attacking ordinary commercial websites when provided with technical guidance .  
tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , and smuggling activities have continued despite repeated attempts to prohibit them ; the phenomena of commercial fraud and debt evasion are becoming increasingly serious ; false financial statements and other behavior that violates financial and economic discipline are quite common ;  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
Under the tidal wave of economic globalization , in order to become a financial and service center , Hong Kong must have a vast economic hinterland , an extensive commercial network , the richest business information in Asia , and a large number of qualified personnel ready to provide services to international investors .  
Meanwhile , various social circles also proposed ways to shake off Taiwan 's economic predicament , and urged the authorities to discard their " no haste , be patient " policy , and to open up the direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links at an early date .  They hope : The urgent problems of enhancing Taiwan 's economic development can be resolved through cross-strait exchanges and cooperation .  
At present , the people and the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are still restless and dissatisfied .  The principal reason is that the will of the people has been distorted and their confidence has been broken .  There are three specific manifestations of this situation :  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .  He hoped that Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles would play a greater role in developing the motherland 's western region and in promoting the common development of Hong Kong and the interior .  
The MAC also analyzed the obstacles to the operation of the three mini links .  It listed the following major factors leading to the failure in starting scheduled flights , in the normal operation of the commercial mechanism for commodity imports and exports , and in allowing mainland tourists into Kinmen and Matsu .  
On this basis , our party seized the opportune moment to creatively realize the socialist transformation of individual farming , handicraft industry , as well as capitalist industrial and commercial industries , destroyed the exploiting system and the exploiting class , and established the socialist system .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
In carrying out such special campaigns , quality inspection , industrial and commercial administration , public security , customs , and other relevant departments should coordinate closely with one another , work in cooperation , and make every possible effort to achieve major results .  
For instance , gratifying changes have emerged in the problem of commercial banks ' bad debts , which had been regarded as a " time bomb " by many financial experts at home and abroad : The central bank has announced that the rate of bad debts of state-owned commercial banks has started to fall since the fourth quarter of last year , and on average it dropped by 2.1 percentage points during the first six months of this year .  
In regard to the petroleum , coal , fireworks , small arms ammunition enterprises and other companies engaged in production of easily combustible and dangerous products ; in regard to the airport , train station , wharf , fuel reserve , and other large scale commercial markets , as well as theaters and other public sites ; and in regard to aircraft , trains , passenger automobiles , cargo ships , and other critical installations , we must strengthen investigation and supervision , formulating a truly feasible incident response plan .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
An informed person in Beijing said that because of weak foreign demand , the State Council has decided to continue the policy of expanding domestic demand in the second half of the year .  The Ministry of Finance will apply to the National People 's Congress next month for an additional issue of 50-billion yuan of constructive treasury bonds , and plans to distribute them to commercial banks in late October after the approval .  
He demanded that the broad ranks of cadres and employees working in the industrial and commercial administration sector nationwide perform their duties conscientiously , reinforce regulation and law enforcement , bravely act as defenders of the market , strive to open up a new prospect in industrial and commercial administration , and make new contributions to the establishment and maintenance of a good order of market economy and the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
While performing their duties , industrial and commercial administration personnel must be impersonal and incorruptible and enforce the law bravely .  They should be brave to make arrests , fulfill their regulatory function , and handle tough cases , waging a relentless war against all lawbreaking and criminal behavior .  
Overall , the contingent of staff of industrial and commercial administration departments we have today is good and a batch of excellent law enforcers who are brave to enforce the law , defy violence and brute force , and do not hesitate to lay down their lives have come to the fore .  
All industrial and commercial law enforcers must be faithful to their duty , be brave to take responsibility , and remain upright and incorruptible .  They should make a good job of market regulation and law enforcement by presenting a clean , honest , and lofty image ;  
On this occasion , on the issue of biological weapons , the Bush Administration uses the excuse that the stipulations of the draft agreement of the protocol , regarding verification and inspection , might threaten US commercial and military secrets , leading to the adoption of an opposition standpoint , in total disregard for the appeals and great efforts of the international community ; this has once again demonstrated that the Bush Administration is determined to obstinately cling to its course and disregard the opposition of the international community .  
It was learned that over the past 23 years , the PLA ocean-going space survey unit has completed a total of 39 ocean-going space survey missions , with its accident-free voyages accumulating to more than 620,000 nautical miles , and has successfully conducted a series of major national-level scientific experiments as well , aside from conducting ocean-going space survey and control for various commercial satellites launched by China for foreign clients .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
In accordance with the Regulations Governing the Administration of Recreational Establishments and on the basis of the principle of " protecting what is legitimate , cracking down on what violates the law , and banning what is illegal , " cultural , public security , industrial and commercial departments at all levels , as well as other functional departments , must resolutely ban recreational establishments that are engaged in illegal operations without a license or a complete license .  
The offshore organizations of commercial banks mentioned in the " Guide " refer to commercial banking organizations set up or acquired outside the border by wholly state-funded commercial banks and shareholding commercial banks .  They include organizations of commercial banks , banks subordinate to wholly state-funded banks , and shareholding and mutual shareholding banks listed in consolidated accounting statements .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
Starting from the fourth quarter of this year , the state-owned commercial banks are expected to increase consumption credit and loans , including those for purchasing residential units and cars .  The authorities hope that the purchases of residential units and cars will become one of the internal driving forces behind China 's steady and accelerating economic growth in the future .  
This method of getting enmeshed in a web of one 's own spinning has muzzled Taiwan 's economic vitality and competitiveness , with the result that Taiwan industrial and commercial enterprises have missed good opportunities for coming to the motherland to invest and run businesses , and the upgrading of Taiwan industries and change of economic pattern have been delayed , and this has also become one of the main reasons for Taiwan 's rapid and serious economic recession in the past year .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
At the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-registered " Sino-US Investment Company , " and it is now planning to set up offices in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China 's biggest window on the world , as its main bases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .  
Therefore , China 's relevant departments have stipulated that in order to protect national interest and economic security , China 's companies are forbidden to buy products with encryption software designed by foreign countries and no domestic organization or individual shall sell foreign commercial encryption products .  
Ye Xuanping said that in the past year , the CPPCC National Committee has strengthened ties with personalities in various circles in Taiwan , made extensive contacts with people of the industrial and commercial circles there , and tried in all possible ways to solve problems and do solid work for Taiwan businessmen .  Besides , it has also severely repudiated the " two-state theory " dished out by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] and strongly condemned the Taiwan authorities ' acts of trying in vain to split up the motherland .

With regard to the grain varieties excluded from the scope of purchases at protective prices , grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises will be allowed to purchase grain in the rural areas after the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at prefectural ( city ) or county level .  
As to the grain varieties still within the scope of purchases at protective prices , the purchasing channels should also be appropriately widened to allow and encourage the grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises to directly purchase grain , subject to the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at provincial level , according to the state policies .  
2 .  It has vigorously developed multiple forms of commercial personal insurance as a major supplement for social security , which has played an important role in raising the social security level , and instituting and perfecting a social security system in China .  
Taiwan 's industrial and commercial circle , political sphere , scholars , and media were all disappointed , and even foreign businessmen also indicated their dissatisfaction .  Taiwan 's stock market continued to fall for straight five days .  The general index fell from 9,119 points on 19 May to 8430 points on 25 May , a fall of almost 700 points .  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
The four major economic trends to emerge in China pointed out by Premier Zhu made the patriots see the broad prospect of having opportunities to serve the motherland , made industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong grasp the endless business opportunities , and made the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong see the brilliant future of economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the hinterland .  
Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the positive role played by friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles in promoting economic cooperation between China 's interior and Hong Kong and common prosperity of the two places .  He expressed his appreciation for friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles , who have the tradition of loving the country and Hong Kong by consistently putting the interests of the country and the nation before anything else .  
He hoped that friends of the industrial and commercial circles will continue to exert a positive influence , support the administration of the government of the special administrative region headed by Mr . Tung Chee-hwa , and further play their role in maintaining long-term stability and prosperity of the society in Hong Kong and further supporting the modernization drive in China 's interior .  
As an international financial , trade , and commercial center , the Hong Kong SAR has also covered a rough and rugged path in its economic development .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
Following the international custom , the PBOC branches organized more than 50,000 man-trips to inspect the quality of assets and genuine profit and loss of more than 38,000 financial institutions ( including branch offices ) in order to promote the improvement of internal management of commercial banks .  
The PBOC and the State Economic and Trade Commission recently issued a joint circular demanding that all commercial banks limit or halt loans to obsolete and backward production capacity , crafts , and products , and to duplicate construction projects .  
He said : Because China will soon join the WTO , is carrying out the strategy of large-scale development of western regions , and , in particular , has registered sustained and steady economic development , Japanese industrial and commercial circles have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for investment in China .  
Today 's video and telephone conference emphasized that from now on , the industrial and commercial administration departments at all levels should keep a tight control on the issue of licenses and turn down all applications from units and individuals who are actually involved in illegal MLM and disguised MLM activities in the name of sole distribution , agency marketing , authorized partnership , direct marketing , chain marketing , or network marketing .  
A person in charge of the Guangdong provincial industrial and commercial administration bureau said : From January to July this year , the industrial and commercial administration departments across the province listed a total of 37 cases of illegal MLM for investigation and handling and dispersed 3.28 million people involved in MLM .  
The fourth civil division has been set up to counter the situation that maritime cases and the commercial cases involving foreigners as well as Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots have increased by a large number along with the constant expansion of opening-up .  With this division , the trial work will take up the challenge from economic globalization .  
According to the demands of the CCDI and the Central Commission for Judicial , Procuratorial , and Public Security Work , as revealed by people in the know , after September there will be a cleanup and rectification of the law enforcement contingent aside from the successive announcement of the outcome of major and important cases with an impact .  A large number of discipline violators and unqualified personnel in industrial and commercial administration , taxation , customs , and other departments will be dismissed or laid off .  
In October the same year , the Bank of China promulgated the " Notice Concerning Risk Control by Commercial Banks While Handling International Settlement of Forward Letters of Credit . " It provides that " commercial banks , in handling their forward letters of credit business , must strictly follow state policies for foreign exchange control and the use of foreign capital , and they must have a genuine background of commodity trade . "  The notice also requires commercial banks to establish sound mechanisms for internal management and control .  
Chen Guangyi said : While constantly deepening reform and accelerating restructuring , we should now continue to implement the proactive fiscal policy and maintain the necessary efforts .  The State Council has proposed that 50 billion yuan of additional long-term treasure bonds for raising construction funds be issued by the Ministry of Finance through commercial banks in the second half of this year , and the central budget be readjusted accordingly .  The proposed measures are necessary .  
Commenting on the issues of direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links [ hereafter termed as the " three links " ] during a meeting with a Taiwan Lien-Ho Pao delegation in Beijing in late August , Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , pointed out : So long as Taiwan authorities acknowledge that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , relevant concrete problems can be easily resolved .  
Although the United States calls ethnic Chinese a " model ethnic minority , " quite a number of whites still look down on ethnic Chinese in their heart of hearts .  Faced with the outstanding achievements of ethnic Chinese in the academic , science and technological , and industrial and commercial fields , they have suffered from a psychological unbalance , and the subconscious attitude of repressing and discriminating against ethnic Chinese has been waiting for the right time to break out .  
While many national economic organizations , major businesses in the industrial , commercial , financial and other sectors and far-sighted personages in various walks of life in the United States actively urged Congress to pass the bill , more and more Congressmen also gave clear-cut support to permanent normal trade relations with China . Solving permanent normal trade relations with China has become the mainstream aspiration in the United States .  
Dai Xianglong said : China has extricated itself from the impact of the Asian financial crisis .  However , in face of the challenges of the financial globalization , the PBOC will continue to practice a moderate monetary policy , further the reform of interest rate marketization , institute a modern commercial banking system , further improve and perfect a unitary and well-managed floating exchange rate system taking the market supply and demand as its foundation , and open the financial sector wider to the world .  
In the separation of government functions from enterprise management , for example , problems arising from the running of commercial enterprises by special interest entities were solved when the military , armed police and political and legal organs were ordered in 1998 to disengage themselves from commercial operations .

It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
In time to come , it will be comparable in size to the central commercial sectors of Taichung and Tainan . And the volume of economic activity in Hsinchu 's commercial sector will increase more than threefold . ( 4 ) Hsiang Shan Mountain City will become a scenic residential district .  
In the process of moving from underdevelopment to prosperity , the simple , unspoilt Polynesians were not as good at business as the Chinese - - the French government helped them set up a consumer coop , but it had to shut down , while the Chinese were spread over all the islands , forming a broad commercial network that even the French themselves could n't compete with .  
Chinoiserie , the vogue for Chinese-style interior decoration , furniture , porcelain and textiles that swept Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , has sometimes been explained as blatant imitation of Chinese products , as freely creative art with China as its inspiration , or even as the product of commercial protectionism aimed at keeping Chinese exports out of contemporary markets .  
According to research by Hsia Li-ming associate professor at Taitung Normal College , there is a marked difference between Chinese imperial maps , produced to meet the political and military requirements of the court , and European navigation charts of the same period , where the commercial interest is foremost .  
Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
Capt . Wang Feng-tien , chief of the supervisory office for second-generation warships says : " The weaponry and electronic warfare systems aboard a warship are varied and complicated . Everything has to be more precise than on merchant ships , from pipe-fitting to welding . There are two to three times the amount of welds , cabling and piping on a 4,000 tonne naval ship as on a 14O , 000 tonne commercial vessel . "  
At noon on May 15,1911 , a riot broke out in the Northern industrial city of Torreon . Three hundred Chinese - - about half the city 's Chinese community - - were killed ; in 1915 , there was a disturbance in another and the mad rioters looted the commercial district murdering over 200 Chinese . In July of the same year , Mexican revolutionary troops and their impoverished supporters pillaged 40 large-scale Chinese owned businesses in Cananea . According to statistics their losses amounted to US $ 5.3 million .  
What disturbed the Mexican people was the presence of another group who had entered the Northern Territory as common laborers on the newly opening land but who through their mutual aid and commercial savvy were able to shed their status as slaves and emerge as a class of " small capitalists " in little more than ten years . Starting with restaurants , laundry shops , and grocery stores and moving on to shoe factories , and garment factories , the Chinese carved out a definite niche for themselves in the economy of northern Mexico .  
With a simple and honest look of a farmer , matched with authentic Taiwanese and heavily accented Mandarin , he was extremely effective at using local flavor to add to the persuasiveness of the commercial . "  
Basically speaking , we use a collage or cut-and-paste postmodern method , using the technique to strengthen a consumer 's impression of a commercial , " explains Hsu Shun-ying , who is creative director at the Yi Shi Hsing Tai Agency , which is responsible for Stimoral 's ads . The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
Pacific Construction , a real estate company chain that adopted a lot of parks , found itself scolded by some city council members as engaged in advertising and commercial activities , maybe because its signs were too conspicuous . " We thought we were going to raise our corporate image , and instead we spent all that money and wound up getting yelled at , " they say , feeling much abused .  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
Then there are those harshly judgmental types in " little theater " who feel the groups like Ping-Fong Acting Troupe and the Performance Workshop are practically commercial in nature and that they make use of superficial political clich ? s and catchwords to create an " overripe , saturated urban space " that 's pretty to look at and easy to digest but lacking in substance .  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
Some , holding that the many items relating to satellite communication technology involved national defense facilities , harbored suspicions that the Chinese communists had " evil intentions . " While economically there might be some small profits to be made , they feared that the national defense would be seriously damaged . Others thought that mainland research that had led to defense technology was far removed from commercial technology that could be profitably sold in the marketplace . They doubted whether Taiwan could use the Chinese communists ' strengths to improve R . O . C . technology .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
The problem of creativity in Taiwan films lies in the fact that the proletarian class is attached to Hong Kong and Hollywood films that are sensory stimulation , while elite culture is still separated by too large a gap . We have lost middle-of-the-road commercial entertainment , " argues Chiao . Ang Lee proves the potential of the middle road .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
In the 1983 elections to expand the Legislative Yuan , the Taipei branch of the KMT broke away from the former stereotyped dogmatic approach , and for the first time used the techniques of commercial advertising to present a packaged image in straightforward , accessible language . This also marked the first time that a commercial advertising agency was brought across the divide into political advertising .  
Luxe has a sixteen-year history of eel farming behind it , with the major market for that product being Japan . It was through familiarity with Japan that the company discovered that Japanese also are very fond of moth orchids . Given the definite market there , the company decided that moth orchids were suitable for large scale commercial production .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition . Mainland manufacturers still offer too few styles , and use outdated materials . They are not like Taiwan firms , which can afford to bring in superior , more durable materials from abroad .  
Furthermore , deeper investigation is required into many questions , such as how many shark species are currently commercially fished and exploited , which commercial shark species ' populations are falling because of both shark meat and shark fin consumption and which purely due to demand for shark fins , and which real shark species ' fins are actually referred to by such shark fin market terminology as " white fin , " " black fin , " " Luzon yellow " or " tailhook . "  
Taipei is also a place where construction is crude and lacks any aesthetic sense , where the first ones to tear down historic buildings come out ahead , and where residential and commercial space is mixed together chaotically . Hsia Chu-joe , a professor in the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University , describes Taipei as " sticky cake " : Neither officials nor urban planners can do anything with it .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
The earliest Chinese urban plan , from the Zhou dynasty ( 1122 BC to 255 BC ) , states that cities should be square , have three gates on each side and nine main roads running parallel both horizontally and vertically , and provide key sites for various temples and a commercial district .  
Liang Kuo-lung feels that despite these disadvantages , as a small town photographer Wu Chin-miao was able to go beyond the level of a mere artisan . He showed imagination in composition and a keen feel for capturing the moment , and he left behind many photographs with an individuality of style , which although they were taken as commercial photographs , are moving and worth more than a passing glance .  
In Kaohsiung , factories in the industrial district begin spewing out smoke of a strange color . In office buildings in the city 's commercial district , air conditioning units large and small come to a halt . It becomes impossible for more than 300,000 households in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area to generate the enticing smells of food being cooked . . . .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
It 's hard to know a dog 's heartHuang Hui-pi states emphatically that the entire process of managing street dogs , including sterilization , mercy killing and monitoring commercial breeders , requires the assistance of veterinarians . Nevertheless , the training process of veterinary medicine lacks a fitting understanding of canine population expansion .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . " One just has to pass the test to get a commercial driver 's license and sign up with a cab company , and one can immediately get on the road and start earning money .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Quite the opposite from what outsiders suspected , the principal reason for prolonging talks was in fact claims of " unfair commercial advantages . " The seemingly sensitive questions of sovereignty and political rivalry were actually secondary .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
Frictional unemployment usually is voluntary . Just a few years ago , when the economy was bubbling and industries like commercial services , finance and insurance , information technology , construction , and national infrastructure were growing rapidly , they could absorb all the " floating " manpower , and frictional unemployment was not a serious problem .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
But Legislative Yuan members , local politicians and landowners rushed en masse to intervene , and the plan to " resurrect " Shihmen 's water sources was thrown out by the Ministry of the Interior . In August this year , after the disastrous typhoon , the residential , commercial and recreational zones around the Shihmen Reservoir were finally reduced in size .  
In early December of last year , the Public Television Broadcasting Law was first placed on the Legislative Yuan 's agenda , and the legislators started discussing its every provision . Those legislators who support the law say that the TV programs we currently have are hardly up to snuff . The ones to be blamed for Taiwan 's questionable quality of culture are commercial TV stations . In order not to let Taiwan 's programming be devoured by alien pop culture , we need a public television station to produce high-quality shows .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year . Yang believes that as long as it does not compromise with governmental or commercial forces , PTV news will be quite competitive , because " their rivals are very weak ! "  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
But associate professor Wang Li-chih of National Taiwan University 's forestry department is not worried that introduced rhododendrons will become dominant species and squeeze out other plants . The hybrid rhododendron cultivars , in which particular features are developed for commercial purposes , actually have weaker constitutions than naturally occurring varieties , and rhododendrons generally choose land " abandoned " by other species : on fertile ground , rhododendron can not necessarily compete with other plants in the wild .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
Modern radio people are a diverse group : senior broadcaster Luo Hsiao-yun often hosts press conferences for pop stars ( top left ) ; Su Lai , who was originally a pop star himself , likes radio work because he gets to play music and talk about his emotions ( bottom left ) ; Li Ming-jou , a hot young radio show host , makes a commercial endorsement ( above ) .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total . The volume of imported materials and exported finished products will total 1.3 million tonnes per year , which will help Taichung Harbor develop into a major international commercial port .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
Li Yih-yuan has discovered that the logic of the almanacs-to seek safety through knowing when to act and when not to-has , in modern commercial society , been transformed . It has been adapted to daily life , especially to the pragmatic pursuit of profit .  
The post-martial-law atmosphere has formed the Taiwan alternative music we see today . Within the music industry system , Magic Stone Records , which used to be an alternative label , has chosen a path between underground and commercial record company operation . They have chosen the good and discarded the bad in both business modes and have carved out an alternative business path which is one of the phenomena worthy of note accompanying this wave .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
Serving cheap but generous portions of good-quality , simple food with the authentic flavor of back home became the forte of dependents ' village eateries . Compared with the fashion in today 's catering industry for creating a trendy marketing image through commercial design and advertising , they seem to give especially good value for money , which is why so many experienced eaters-out are always on the lookout for them . But with the march of time , many of these little eateries are closing down or moving .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
It is one a.m . and the rhythms of techno music pulsate through a pub in the Hsinyi commercial district . Young people , filled with perhaps more than simple youthful energy , some wearing white gloves or waving fluorescent light sticks , bop around on a tiny dance floor bathed in black fluorescent light . Waving their hands in time with the music , they look like they are conducting some sort of intense pantomime .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
She had been acting as if she had come down with Alzheimer 's after the earthquake , she recalls , drifting along dazed and confused . Her mind is much clearer these days . She used to be quite timid , she says , but upon seeing a television microphone now , she jokes , echoing a TV commercial , " I am not scared of that thing anymore ; you can bring it closer . "  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
As a matter of fact , after assuming the KMT chairmanship in March 2000 , Lien Chan stated that after a comprehensive examination of party assets and commercial investments , it had been discovered that during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , when Liu Tai-ying was director-general of the KMT 's Investment and Business Management Committee , there were eight highly controversial investment cases with combined total losses of NT $ 9.8 billion .  
In the past , except for special industry databases , sources such as online news sites and all kinds of personal web pages provided an endless wealth of freely accessible information for people browsing the web , leaving little room for the survival of commercial web sites . Even portal sites such as Yam , and Yahoo 's Taiwan subsidiary Kimo , which claimed to have millions of subscribers , were frustrated by their lack of an " excuse " to charge fees .  
Every shot in A Journey of Impressions is like an individual photograph . The camera work has great feeling , and in concert with the relaxing and rhythmic musical soundtrack , it brought the documentary happily into the realm of reportage . The show also broke new ground for social-education programming by selling all of its commercial slots .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business . A more exciting question and one worth waiting for and answer is : Can the media culture fostered in the free environments of Hong Kong and Taiwan capable of stimulating mainland China in a positive way ?  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
" Although you could n't really say that the number of contracts actually signed is huge , we 're setting ourselves up for the future as a kind of consultant , helping integrate and strengthen each individual client according to their respective distribution weaknesses , " says Choice Group vice-chairman Jimmy Cheng . Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
Since economic reform began here in the 1990s , Shanghai has become China 's most dynamic boomtown , and today the main commercial districts are more glittering than ever before . Into this city have flooded the best Taiwanese restaurants of all types , offering everything from affordable day-to-day fare to recreational fashion cuisine to high-end gastronomic delicacies , forming a veritable " Taiwanese school " of no small weight and status .  
Lin Pen-hsuan , assistant professor at the Institute of Sociology at Nanhua University , reminds us that in this extremely commercialized world , people have moved from viewing the body as taboo , then opening up to an acceptance of it , to seeing that it can be manipulated and played around with . From beauty treatments and body sculpting to sexual promiscuity , the body is often packaged into a variety of discourses and commercial ends . Is there no escape from all of this , even in death ?  
Back in the days when cities relied on rail transport , train stations were catalysts for commercial development . But thanks to Changhua 's geography , while the nice plain to the east of the station became a thriving commercial and residential area , the western side stayed so quiet you can just about see tumbleweeds roll past .  
The Vice Premier noted that China and Nepal , as two developing nations , are economically complementary He hoped industrial and commercial circles of the two countries could work out more projects with less investment and quick results to benefit the peoples , and enhance a steady development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation  
iran and slovenia also agreed to establish air links between tehran and ljubljana , the slovenian capital , as well as + cultural , scientific , commercial and economic ties , + the radio said

Examples were given of independent oral undertakings established in the context of individual relationships of a commercial or noncommercial nature , which might be valid under applicable rules of national law .  
A specific aspect of this development especially worried the international community : the major troubled debtors were large , middleincome economies that owed the bulk of their debts to the top commercial banks of the key industrialized countries .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
During this year the international community has viewed with deep concern and alarm the approval by the United States Congress of legislative initiatives to move the economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba to unimaginable levels , particularly the new extraterritorial dimensions that the most conservative circles in the Congress want to give to a policy that , since its inception , has been designed to impose United States law on third States .  
On the contrary , in a wide range of forums we have rejected unilateral coercive measure that affect the well-being of peoples , hamper free trade , and are alien to universally recognized commercial practices .  
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .

The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
Unless women 's human rights , as defined by international conventions and standards , are fully applied , interpreted and enforced in civil , penal and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist only in name .

Travel costs for the military and civilian personnel have been calculated on the basis of the following travel rates : ( a ) for repatriation of military contingent personnel , by group travel arrangements , at a rate of $ 540 per person ; and ( b ) for international civilian personnel , by commercial arrangements , at a rate of $ 3,500 per person one way or $ 7,000 round trip , inclusive of the entitlement for excess unaccompanied baggage .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
The overexpenditure under this heading was a result of higher requirements for standard troop cost reimbursement ( $ 171,000 ) due to the delayed departure of the Finnish contingent in December 1993 , to additional ration costs ( $ 78,000 ) to replenish UNDOF 's provisions inventory to a level sufficient to sustain operations while newly sought commercial ration contracts were being established , and to slightly higher than anticipated travel costs ( $ 8,000 ) .  
Eight workshops on ( i ) application of commercial quality standards for perishable produce in countries in transition of central and eastern Europe ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) topics of interest to countries in transition of central and eastern Europe , as determined by the Timber Committee ( 4 ) ; and ( iii ) topics of interest to countries in transition of central and eastern Europe , as determined by the Joint FAO / ECE / ILO Committee on Forest Technology , Management and Training ( 2 ) .  
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
It includes extremist but none the less influential sectors which , for ideological as well as economic reasons , will be eager to employ this new weapon in their ongoing campaign to disrupt Cuba 's mutually beneficial commercial relations with third countries .  
With the institution of SICA , integration is no longer sectoral that is , commercial and economic but comprehensive , meaning that it extends to the economic , social , cultural and political spheres and seeks to promote their harmonious and balanced development .  
In assessing costs for example of human resource development investments , the family decision-making structure will take into account inhibiting as well as motivating factors affecting their decisions to invest time in the schooling of girls , the opportunity costs of lost household or other ( e.g . agricultural , smallholding or commercial ) labour , or cultural / psychological stress on individuals as a consequence of non-traditional occupational or " career " choices .  
I am pleased to annex hereto for your information the text of decision 360 , entitled " Rejection of renewed attempts by the Congress of the United States of America to tighten the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba " , which was adopted on 13 July 1995 at the twenty-first regular session of the Council of the Latin American Economic System , held at the ministerial level in San Salvador , El Salvador .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Unless the human rights of women , as defined by international human rights instruments , are fully recognized and effectively protected , applied , implemented and enforced in national law as well as in national practice in family , civil , penal , labour and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist in name only .  
Review national laws , including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family , civil , penal , labour and commercial law in order to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedures of all relevant international human rights instruments by means of national legislation , and revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice ;  
In line with its support for General Assembly resolution 49 / 9 , the Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba and considers it a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , lacking acceptable justification in current international affairs .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
NULLAlthough special programmes and specialized financial institutions are important , their limited coverage means that a sustained impact on the problem of underfunding of micro-enterprises and SMEs calls for more active involvement of commercial banks , which tend to exclude this portion of the population because of the conviction that it is too costly to service .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
That this serious problem should necessitate strengthened efforts on the international debt strategy was acknowledged at the mid-term review , and a number of actions were agreed upon in the areas of official bilateral debt , multilateral debt , and commercial debt .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 and 49 / 9 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
a similar vein , recognizing that information provided in notifications may , in certain instances , be proprietary and sensitive for commercial reasons , the information provided shall be treated as confidential and restricted to the Commission and IAEA , to the extent that this is consistent with their respective responsibilities under Security Council resolution 715 ( 1991 ) , other relevant resolutions and the plans .  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked . 
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

Suspiciously enough , these events come together at one point : the passing by the United States Congress of the infamous piece of legislation aimed at definitively blockading Cuba from the rest of the world , when over 35 years of a cruel and ever-worsening economic , commercial and financial blockade have failed and has been condemned year after year by this sovereign Assembly .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
In an international environment characterized by the exacerbation of commercial , financial and cultural competition , in which international aid is becoming scarcer , strengthening the endogenous capacities of Africa is a healthy imperative to allow our continent to take its destiny into its own hands .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Grave concerns have been expressed that despite the worldwide call for an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba , this embargo not only continues but has been further strengthened and extended since the Helms-Burton Act was promulgated in March this year .  
Russia , firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and international navigation , supports and intends to broaden normal economic and commercial ties with Cuba , based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage , and to put them into effect in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
Bangladesh welcomed the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action , which embodied practical commitments and priorities for action at the national , regional and international levels for preventing the commercial sexual exploitation of children , and for protecting and reintegrating the children who were its victims . 
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation . 
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
In particular , it established rules of substantive law governing two aspects that were of central importance to the commercial utility of those instruments : the independence of the undertaking from the underlying transaction , and the establishment of rules that would apply in instances of fraudulent calling of the undertaking .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
The continuing presence of the international civilian personnel and local staff in the mission area during the withdrawal period is required to provide uninterrupted administrative support to the contingents and to ensure the recovery , collection , disposal and shipment of the United Nations-owned and leased assets , hand-over of rented premises , and settlement of commercial contracts and agreements with the local vendors . 
To achieve broad-based cooperation against drug trafficking by sea , Governments were invited to encourage commercial carriers and professional groups active in maritime transport to become involved in the fight against illicit drug traffic , on the basis of voluntary cooperation and memoranda of understanding at the national and international levels , as well as through training to increase the awareness of maritime transport personnel with regard to illicit drug trafficking .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
On the contrary , this threat is an inevitable consequence of the activities of organizations that deny the State its legitimate monopoly of violence , corrupt State institutions , undermine the rule of law , threaten the integrity of financial and commercial sectors of society , contravene legal and social norms and conventions , transgress national sovereignty and violate national borders . 
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
A major objective of this subprogramme is to provide Governments and legislators with universally acceptable , modern and harmonized treaties and model laws in areas where harmonization of commercial law is desirable and feasible , and also to provide commercial parties with non-legislative texts ( e.g . model clauses , rules and legal guides ) to assist them in implementing international transactions . 
ECLAC studies in international trade , transportation and the financing of development focused on the design of policies and mechanisms to foster the continued expansion and improvement of the commercial linkages of Latin America and the Caribbean with the changing world economy , particularly in view of the current trends towards globalization in production and increasing liberalization of trade and finance .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
INFOTERRA , the Global Environmental Information Exchange Network , is operating through 171 government-designated national focal points ; a network of 8,000 sources of information , including national and international institutions , non-governmental organizations , industrial and commercial enterprises , academic institutions and experts ; 34 special sectoral sources , and 10 regional service centres .  
Economic and environmental questions : reports of subsidiary bodies , In decision 1996 / 305 , the Council decided to continue consideration of agenda item 6 ( i ) , including the draft resolution entitled " Corruption and bribery in transnational commercial activities " ( E / 1996 / L . 26 ) , at its resumed substantive session of 1996 , and also requested the President of the Council to continue to facilitate open-ended consultations prior to its resumed substantive session , with a view to enhancing the prospects for achieving consensus . 
On 2 November 1995 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 10 , entitled " Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba " , in which it requested the Secretary-General , in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system , to prepare a report on the implementation of the resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-first session .  
At the eleventh summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , the heads of State or Government " called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to the principle of neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage " .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
Under the new initiative it would be determined after the initial three-year period whether Naples terms , together with comparable relief by non-Paris Club bilateral donors and commercial creditors , would be sufficient to put the country in a sustainable debt-service position .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
The order covers basic , decentralized vocational training and education in Greenland in the following main areas : metalworking ; construction ; commercial and clerical trades ; food trades ; fisheries ; social services ; health services ; graphic trades ; service trades .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The effects on the mental and psychological health of children subject to commercial sexual exploitation are not easy to diagnose , and can be healed only through expensive and prolonged treatment .  
For while having children trapped in certain unhealthy working conditions may be far from ideal , simply closing this door to children without providing them with viable alternatives may drive them deeper underground into the much more hazardous world of commercial sexual exploitation ;  
It is noteworthy that , while some Member States may have expressed reservations with respect to this or other provisions of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States on a variety of grounds , they have nonetheless expressed through the European Community 's statements and elsewhere their objection to the Helms-Burton legislation , so extreme and unjustified is its interference with their sovereign decision to maintain normal economic and commercial relations with Cuba .  
Foreign proceeding means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in a foreign State in which proceeding the asset and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court or other competent authority , for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation [ provided that the debts were not incurred predominantly for household or other personal rather than commercial purposes ] ;  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .

These projects include the compilation , review and implementation of measures to facilitate trade flows , to promote national transport activities , to increase awareness on efficient commercial practices in international trade , as well as to provide Customs administrations with proper working tools designed to increase efficiency and transparency in Customs clearance time and revenue collection and to generate timely and reliable trade data .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of this Declaration ;  
The offer , promise or giving of any payment , gift or other advantage , directly or indirectly , by any private or public corporation , including a transnational corporation , or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official 's or representative 's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction ;

Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
As regards the prices charged by the project company , two basic approaches have been observed : in some cases the project company is free to determine its pricing and commercial policy , while in other cases the law subjects the initial price charged by the project company to some control mechanism ( e.g . approval by the competent regulatory body , or requirement that the prices be provided in the project agreement ) .  
An appropriate legal framework for the settlement of those disputes may be provided by means of special legislation , based on internationally accepted standards , governing international commercial arbitration and reflecting particular needs of international arbitration .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
Also to be considered is the expansion of United Nations efforts to achieve agreement on key issues required for a favourable environment for business , such as uniform commercial codes and intellectual property and accounting standards , and to deal with transnational problems , such as crime and corruption , which inhibit both good governance and good business .  
But would it be outrageous to say that it is not completely true either , because it is obvious that in Africa there exist countries whose development level is already allowing them to cherish some legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the international market as well as countries that still require assistance , at least in certain areas , and particularly in the social area . 
Linked to the creation of economic and commercial activities adapted to the various areas concerned , microeconomic and microfinance projects supported by the Agency and often carried out with the assistance of local bodies like Environmental Development Action in the Third World ( ENDA ) have had beneficial , rapid and lasting results . 
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .  
Non-governmental organizations provide a wide variety of services to help orient and settle new arrivals , including temporary housing , interpretation , accompanying individuals to governmental agencies , guidance in seeking employment and permanent housing , orienting family members to public and commercial services such as schools and stores , etc .  
After a three-year assessment period , countries for which existing debt-reduction mechanisms are considered insufficient for achieving sustainability would receive debt reduction of up to 90 per cent on eligible debt by Paris Club creditors , comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors , and reduction of claims by multilateral creditors .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
A prevalence of environmental inequities based on socio _ economic and racial factors has been reported : of the two factors , race appears to have both an independent and a more important relationship with the distribution of commercial hazardous waste facilities than income .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
The priorities pursued , which the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse , include a multidisciplinary approach , involving social services and mental health workers , to interviewing and investigation , special treatment in court settings which are child-friendly and appropriate to age and status , and continuing care in order to address the lingering effects of commercial sexual exploitation .  Measures are to be reinforced through education systems which provide children with skills and opportunities as a preventive strategy .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
In response it was noted that the adjective " financial " had a narrow meaning in a number of legal systems , as related to transactions with currency , securities or stocks in the financial market .  Also the adjective " commercial " , which was used in some legal systems to refer to transactions covered by a particular body of law sometimes referred to as " commercial law " , might be interpreted as excluding certain categories of debtors whose transactions were not qualified as " commercial affairs " in those legal systems .  
The third stage , once the crisis is contained , is to stimulate recovery , by recreating accountable systems of governance , reviving commercial and economic activity , promoting social cohesion , rebuilding infrastructure , restoring health and education services and encouraging individual enterprises .  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
It was said that it would be very important to direct such an effort towards the development of international norms and standards for commercial conduct in the field , with the intent of supporting trade through electronic media , and not have as a goal the establishment of a regulatory regime for service providers , or other rules which could create costs unacceptable for market applications of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) ( ibid . , para .  117 ) .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
[ 43 ] / The main conclusion reached in this study on income distribution at the international level is to signal the need to include cooperation agreements tied to commercial agreements on free trade and economic and commercial cooperation , whether at the international , regional or bilateral level . 
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
Our signature of the Convention and the subsequently active role we took in the joint endeavour to craft it into workable mechanisms reflect in general Israel 's vision of the world in which it wishes to exist and prosper _ in particular its continuing interest , which is shared by many other countries , to preserve the Convention 's core balance between a State 's duty to demonstrate compliance and its right to protect itself from intrusive and abusive encroachment on its security and its commercial and proprietary interests .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Subsequently , the importance of managing wildfire hazards became the dominant policy promoted through the collaborating interests of public authorities , commercial interests and local commitments driven by a combination of balanced economic , social and ecological values .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Invites the relevant international financial institutions to give appropriate consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
The potential danger posed by the frequent passage of commercial vessels , and on occasion vessels carrying hazardous , toxic and radioactive wastes through the high seas surrounding a number of small island developing States , continues unattenuated .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The earlier than anticipated departure , effective 2 February 1996 , of the key military logistic support unit provided to UNAMIR required that the functions of that unit be provided through commercial contractors .  
While repatriation travel of staff officers was arranged on commercial aircraft and reflected under other travel costs budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , other military contingent personnel departed on the UNAMIR-chartered aircraft , with respective costs absorbed under the fixed-wing aircraft heading , resulting in savings of $ 826,600 .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
While the United Nations has long experience in implementing humanitarian programmes during periods of peace , conflict and post-conflict situations , it should be emphasized that the humanitarian programme pursuant to resolution 986 ( 1995 ) is unique and is being implemented within the context of a sanctions regime with all its attendant political and commercial dimensions .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context , that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
This was done for practical reasons , including a desire to allow the Ministry a high degree of flexibility in securing numerous and diverse offers from a variety of sources , at competitive prices and on the customary commercial terms , and in order to avoid being restricted to a single brand name under which all our requirements for a particular item might not be available within the period the Memorandum of Understanding is in effect .  
Revised standards for dry and dried fruit ; United Nations / ECE standard for bovine carcasses and commercial cuts ; revised standards for Early and Ware Potatoes ; promotional brochures for UN / EDIFACT ; trade facilitation and UN / EDIFACT training manual ;  
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
As far as the Russian Federation directly is concerned , it is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation mentioned in the resolution and supports , and intends to continue to develop normal commercial and economic ties with Cuba based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage and put into practice in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms without any form of discrimination and on the basis of world prices .  
Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
One major initiative , of which UNDP was one of the main supporters , was the Micro-credit Summit held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 , which brought together 2,500 participants from more than 100 countries , including beneficiaries of micro-finance programmes , organizers of micro-credit projects , commercial and development banks , non-governmental organizations , multilateral and bilateral donors , as well as heads of Government and senior officials who were heads of small business promotional institutions . 
Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .  
The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the existence of commercial sexual exploitation of children , through loosely organized networks , in rich , private houses known as Mbwa kali , which refers to the Beware of fierce dog signs posted outside the gates .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .

At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
The major cost required for the rental of transmission and distribution facilities ( $ 5,948,000 per biennium ) is a recurring cost calculated at commercial prices and as such is not sustainable within existing resources .  
Despite economic hardships exacerbated by the illegal economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America , Cubas Government continued to devote a significant and growing proportion of its budget to social protection programmes .  
My Governments pattern of payments clearly reflects its unshakable determination to meet its budgetary obligations despite the extraordinary difficulties it is facing as a result of the rigid , irrational and inhuman economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on Cuba for more than three long decades .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Expresses its deep concern at the lack of progress in investigating the downing of the two aircraft chartered by the United Nations and the loss under suspicious circumstances of other commercial aircraft over UNITA controlled areas , and reiterates its call upon all concerned , especially UNITA , to cooperate fully with and to facilitate an immediate and objective international investigation of these incidents ;

At international level , our country is due to sign the Patent Cooperation Treaty , although alternative measures do exist to avoid the abuse of patents as well as monopolistic and anti _ competitive commercial practices on the part of patent inventors .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
The main objective of this measure is to maintain a modern legal framework which responds to the current economic and social situation by helping to consolidate our economic and commercial liberalization process , and thus facilitating investment and trade ;  
Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .

Child pornography means the conception , production , presentation , dissemination , whether or not on commercial basis , visual or audio , that constitute a real or simulated representation of a child engaged or depicted as engaged in sexual activity or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child for promoting or satisfying sexual purposes .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
In addition , it was observed that the result would rather be that the draft Convention validated such assignments , as a matter of civil or commercial law , while leaving to other law specific challenges to their validity ( e.g . , the invalidation of an assignment made within the suspect period before the opening of an insolvency proceeding as a fraudulent or preferential transfer ) . 
In other national laws a link is required between the property to be attached and the claim in that , for example , immunity can not be pleaded in respect of funds allocated for economic or commercial activity governed by private law upon which the claim is based or that immunity can not be pleaded with respect to assets set aside by the State to pursue its commercial activities .  
In order for space exploration and development to benefit all United Nations Member States more effectively , greater international cooperation will be needed , not only on specific projects such as environmental monitoring and protection , but also in ensuring that international regulatory structures encourage commercial space activities in ways that are predictable , transparent and effective .  
This does not fit in with the traditional concept of the commercial money market or purchasing flexibility , and constitutes a senseless waste of Iraqi funds , for reasons linked to the mechanism used by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for processing memorandum of understanding contracts .  
Once a junior company has identified a commercial deposit and carried out initial development work , the deposit is usually sold to larger corporations with better financial and technical resources .

During the period under review , the Government of Argentina maintained its position that the restoration of communications between the mainland and the Falkland Islands ( Malvinas ) continued to be a primary objective , since improved links would produce commercial and economic benefits for the entire region , by creating the necessary framework for achieving a greater understanding between the inhabitants of the region and for serving their interests .  
Abilities essential to the reduction of natural and similar disasters are increasingly being drawn from the public sector , professional and institutional organizations , commercial interests and local forms of community leadership . 
Since this was likely to prove particularly difficult at the international level and be of limited relevance to international commercial transactions , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be clarified .  
Comparisons with other regulatory mechanisms for analogous markets ( such as the transport of toxic wastes and hazardous products , the regulation of securities and financial markets and institutions , the marking and tracing of weapons and other commercial goods , and treaty instruments containing provisions for judicial cooperation or extraterritorial jurisdiction ) should also be examined .

The United States , which has continued to apply laws and measures affecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of other States and freedom of trade and navigation , as well as inflicting tremendous pain on the Cuban people , should , in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions of the United Nations , put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
That the United States of America continues to ignore the will of the international community , as embodied in the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly with a view to lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba , is to be regarded as a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations .  
On the basis of the foregoing , the Sudan opposes the economic and commercial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , which has caused great damage to the Cuban people and violated its legitimate rights and interests , being a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and showing disregard for their lofty and noble principles .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .

Mr . Mra ( Myanmar ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegations appreciation for the Secretary-Generals report contained in document A 54-259 , dated 18 August 1999 , on agenda item 33 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
In keeping with these positions and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and universally recognized principles of international law , Mali will this year again associate itself with the Member States calling for the lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of America .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban in September 1998 ; Malaysia strongly supported the final document of that summit , wherein the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries reiterated their call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial actions against Cuba .  
In this light , it is pertinent to note that the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement during the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly , held in New York on 23 September 1999 , once again called on the parties concerned to strictly comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions and emphasized the need to terminate the economic , commercial and financial sanctions against Cuba .  
We reaffirm our intention to continue to develop normal commercial and economic relations with Cuba , based on common interest and mutual benefit and implemented in strict accordance with our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and generally recognized principles and norms of international law , without any discrimination or jeopardy to the legal rights and interests of the parties .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Acknowledging that special attention must be given to the mental health needs of women , including those who are marginalized because of , inter alia , race , ethnicity , religion , age , social and economic status , physical and or mental disability , exploitative commercial sex , displacement , migration and human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV AIDS ) ,  
Among the cleaner transportation fuels , within a near-term horizon , natural gas appears to be the most likely and cost-effective significant alternative to motor gasoline and diesel , particularly for use in fleets , given its abundant resources , its possibilities as a high performance fuel , its clean burning qualities and its convenient commercial availability to end users , especially in the major transportation consumer nations .  
Reaffirms its resolve to establish the truth about the circumstances of and to determine the responsibility for the downing of the two aircraft chartered by the United Nations and the loss under suspicious circumstances of other commercial aircraft over UNITA controlled territory through an immediate and objective international investigation of these tragic incidents , and reiterates its call upon all concerned , especially UNITA , to cooperate fully with and to facilitate such an investigation ;

The Special Rapporteur attended the seventh session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 22 and 23 April 1998 and made a statement on 22 April 1998 , in which he said that crime prevention and bribery in international commercial transactions required the cooperation not only of the international community but the political will of Governments to organize their domestic systems of justice to meet the challenges . 
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms , as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
It is also one of the most effective tools to combat intolerance by opening the gateway to messages of mutual respect , enabling them to circulate freely worldwide , and by encouraging collective actions to oppose and bring to an end such phenomena as hate speech , racism and the sexual and commercial exploitation of , in particular , women and children .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Also noteworthy was another triangular initiative in support of Cuba ' s economic recovery , under which expertise was transferred from Brazil , Chile and Mexico , with triangular support provided by Norway , in macroeconomic policy formulation , national budgeting , central banking accounting , treasury functions , commercial banking and external debt management .  
The suggestion of the Commissions Working Group on the topic to delete any reference to the nature or purpose of State activities in determining whether the activities should be considered commercial transactions , and thus subject to the internal jurisdiction of another State , touched upon one of the most controversial points in the entire draft .  
In cases where public ownership and control is desired , direct private financing as well as infrastructure operation under commercial principles may be achieved by establishing a separate legal entity controlled by the Government to own and operate the project .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
It is advisable that statutory criteria for determining tariffs and fees take into account , in addition to social factors the Government regards as relevant , the concessionaires interest in achieving a level of cash flow that ensures the economic viability and commercial profitability of the project .  
While rules of private international law often allow considerable freedom to choose the law governing commercial contracts , that freedom is in some countries restricted for contracts and legal relationships that are not qualified as commercial , such as , for instance , certain contracts entered into by public authorities of the host country ( for example , guarantees and assurances by the Government , power purchase or fuel supply commitments by a public authority ) or contracts with consumers .  
It is instructive to conclude from it that the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is a unilateral action , whose extraterritorial effects have no validity in public international law .  
Determining actual and reasonable costs is often difficult for troop contributors to do , especially when they move matriel and personnel by military means and can not therefore easily provide documentary evidence of an acceptable national commercial rate .  
However , it was agreed that strong international support measures , including financial , technical and commercial assistance , are of critical importance in influencing the future growth and development of LDCs .  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
These measures have serious adverse impact on the overall economic , commercial , political , social and cultural life of the targeted countries , and intensify their challenges in this era of globalization and its concomitant traumatic transformations .  
In this regard , it recommended that creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions be encouraged to consider continuing the initiative and efforts to address commercial debt of heavily indebted African countries .  
Regarding commercial debt of LDCs , orderly and equitable workout procedures should be established , with explicit responsibilities of creditors and debtors and clearly defined roles for the public and private sectors .  
No less than some thirty conventions , multilateral agreements , uniform model laws or standard rules relating to international commercial dealings or international carriage are involved .  
From the viewpoint of international commercial operators , the question is considered in its traditional private law aspect : evidential rules are of key importance in contractual matters and in the settlement of disputes between commercial parties .  
The view was expressed that a single issue / item for discussion should be included in the agenda of the forty-first session of Legal Subcommittee on international cooperation in limiting obtrusive commercial space advertising that could interfere with astronomical observations , as had been proposed by the delegation of the United States .  
In support of this affirmation , I should merely like to draw attention to the meeting to be held tomorrow , in a room adjoining this one , where the Economic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions will come together to design a new worldwide financial architecture which will be based on the social issues which were stressed by our heads of State at the Millennium Summit , and not merely on economic and commercial profit .  
Acknowledging the host countrys position that it was not in a position to interfere with personal and commercial transactions in the free market , he expressed the view that the foregoing must be considered in the light of the host countrys obligations vis - - vis the permanent missions and their staff , including their housing .  
To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety , international civil servants must not accept , without authorization from the executive head , any honour , decoration , gift , remuneration , favour or economic benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations ; it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and other entities .  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
The development of a comprehensive convention on international space law with due regard for the sovereign rights of States could help to resolve such difficult issues as the delimitation and definition of outer space , control of space pollution , management of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , registration of space objects , protection of intellectual property , responsibility and the settlement of disputes .  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
Representatives of national space agencies , foreign and defence ministries , academies of science , leading outer-space-related scientific and research centres , commercial and industrial companies , international and non-governmental outer space organizations , universities , scientific and education centres , insurance companies and banks engaged in outer-space-related activities , and also cosmonauts and astronauts have been invited to attend the forum .  
Given that the forthcoming conference is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of Yury Gagarins flight , considerable attention will be paid to the issues of the peaceful use of outer space and international - including commercial - cooperation in its exploration as a real alternative to the militarization of outer space .  
In view of the unstable security situation in the country and in order to avoid potential security gaps related to the continuing repatriation of ECOMOG troops , significant resources were utilized for the transportation by air of contingent-owned equipment , stores and supplies , as well as for the strengthening of UNAMSIL air operations capability by enhancing its helicopter fleet with armed military helicopters and commercial heavy-lift rotary aircraft .  
The view was expressed that the initiative held considerable potential for facilitating the development of commercial activities in outer space , to the benefit of countries and in all economic spheres .  
In order not to stifle those potential economic benefits , that delegation stressed the need to ensure that the final texts of those instruments satisfied the requirements of financial markets to overcome existing commercial risks associated with financing of space projects .  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
The view was expressed that the proposal by the delegation of the United States regarding international cooperation in limiting obtrusive commercial space advertising concerned a matter of relatively little importance when considered alongside many of the other potential issues for consideration by the Legal Subcommittee .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
No matter how valuable a particular item of property may be to a commercial enterprise , it will have little or no value to a creditor as collateral for a loan unless the creditor is able to obtain a security right in the property that has priority over other creditors and remains effective in insolvency proceedings and that is capable of being enforced by the creditor in a predictable and timely fashion .

Urge States to foster the creation , growth and expansion of minority-owned businesses by increasing access to capital through , inter alia , community development banks , work with the private sector to create jobs , help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas ;  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
FAO also assists in the development of institutions for the management of common pool natural resources oriented towards reconciling conflicting interests in watersheds between upstream and downstream water users or in fish-producing areas between artisanal and commercial fishermen . 
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
The qualifications would specifically need to embrace : general management ( setting targets and milestones , planning strategic measures by which to achieve targets , estimating costs and design budgets , finance , implementation and control ) ; pedagogics ( theoretical formation as well as skills in the design and delivery of courses , adequate knowledge of educational and training policies and regimes ) ; substantive experience and knowledge ( trade and commerce , business and global logistics , technologies , operation , organization , economics and commercial processes of maritime transport ) .  
Since industrial environments such as shipping and ports undergo continuous technological , organizational and commercial change in a world which is changing continuously in respect of social and political structures , the evaluation and validation of courses - as well as the updating of instructors - must also be continuous .  Otherwise , an admirable system may end up teaching the wrong things !  
Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
The harm done to the Cuban people has been established before competent judicial authorities and abundantly documented in the reports submitted to the General Assembly each year by the Secretary-General under the item Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
At the national level , three distinct but complementary institutional structures are emerging to reflect the expanding role of the private sector as the main provider of transport and related commercial services .  
First , as the public sector retreats from commercial services , allowing the private sector to take the leading role , the public sector is assuming the role of regulator to ensure fair competition among service providers , protecting the consumer against monopoly abuse and enforcing quality and safety standards to protect the consumer .  
In preparing and adopting model legislative provisions on international commercial conciliation , the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL or the Commission ) was mindful that such provisions would be a more effective tool for States modernizing their legislation if accompanied by background and explanatory information .  
In the current conducive environment , such measures contravene all laws , principles and norms governing international relations in the field of global trade and directed towards the enhancement of extensive commercial and economic interactions among countries .  
Bridges should be built in the political , economic , financial , commercial , technical and social realm , and institutions should be strengthened at all levels , to facilitate such integration in a just and equitable process .  
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
The problems created by globalization could provoke a genuine crisis of confidence among the worlds people as they saw poverty worsening , income unequally distributed within and among countries and international financial and commercial markets prey to instability at a time when the international community had never had such economic and technological means at its disposal .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to submit , when practicable , for the consideration of the General Assembly , a comprehensive report on : the outcome of the schematic design ; options for deciding on the final scale of the project ; projected revenues and the cost of operating and maintaining the new visitors experience ; proposals for expanded commercial activities ; options for operating methodologies ; means of adjusting to changing situations ; procedures for the operation of the proposed capital improvement fund ; and a time-line for implementation . 
A range of interests needs to be accommodated by that legal mechanismthe debtor , the owners and management of the debtor , the creditors who may be secured to varying degrees , employees , fiscal creditors , guarantors of debt and unsecured creditors , as well as government , commercial and social institutions and practices that are relevant to the design of the mechanism and to the institutional framework required for its operation .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
His delegation welcomed the efforts of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) with regard to a draft convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property ; given the growth in commercial use of outer space and the increasing role played by the private sector , further work was necessary to develop legal instruments and regulations to deal with matters such as financing , mortgages and guarantees . 
The system supported domestic applications in areas such as crop forecasting , ground and surface water harvesting , forest surveying , wasteland and potential fishing-zone mapping , urban planning and environmental monitoring ; and the data from those satellites was being shared with several countries under commercial agreements .  
Within the framework of a comprehensive convention , complex issues such as the delimitation and definition of outer space , the monitoring of pollution by man-made debris , the regulation of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , the protection of intellectual property rights and the settlement of disputes could be resolved in a mutually acceptable manner .  
Experts mentioned the following as being among the specific difficulties faced by SMEs : demand volatility , and the consequent lack of transparency and predictability in the business environment ; large capital requirements ; weak linkages with international markets ; scarce information about commercial opportunities abroad ; and the difficulty in finding highly trained personnel .  
The key activities undertaken by the Government in 2001 included the finalization of the space safety regime , finalization of regulations to facilitate the operation of the commercial space industry ( the Space Activities Regulations 2001 ) , issuing the first instrument under the Australian Space Activities Act 1998 , signature of a major international agreement on space cooperation with the Russian Federation , facilitation of several major commercial launch projects , the completion of a future plan for the Australian spatial information industry , as well as extensive remote sensing and meteorological science and technology activities .  
Promoting an open , inclusive and participatory approach to setting standards , regulatory frameworks and governance mechanisms for ICT-related activities , inter alia , in areas such as privacy , cyber-crime and commercial and financial transactions drawing on the work under way in a number of international bodies and industrial consortia aimed at developing solutions to regulatory issues ;  
The increasing availability of courses offered through national training institutions , universities and faculties of law in dispute settlement law for students at the graduate level and for specialized degree programmes for expert trainers in dispute settlement and international commercial arbitration ;  
The following may not be protected by patents : diagnostic , therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals ; an invention whose use would be contrary to public order or morality , it being understood that such use will not be considered contrary to public order or morality solely because it is prohibited , limited or made subject to conditions by a legal or administrative provision and an invention whose commercial use is necessary to preserve the health of humans , animals , plants or the environment ;

According to regulations by the National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau , international commercial loans indicate loans raised and borrowed by domestic institutions from financial institutions , enterprises , individual or other economic organizations abroad , and from foreign-funded financial institutions within China 's border , whose contractual repayment obligations are in foreign currency .  
Export credits , international financing leaseholds , compensation trades with foreign exchange repayment methods , overseas institution 's and individual 's foreign exchange deposits ( excluding foreign exchange deposits in banks approved for offshore operations ) , project financing , financing under trade projects over 90 days and other forms of foreign exchange loans will all be treated and managed as international commercial loans .  
The National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau clearly stipulated in the new method that , domestic institutions borrowing international commercial loans externally are only limited to : China-capital financial institutions approved by the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau to operate foreign exchange loan business ; juridical people of non-financial corporations approved by the State Department 's Authorization Department .  
Article 41 Those that violate article 13 of these regulations should be given a warning by industrial and commercial administration organs and other organs of administrative law enforcement .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
Article 44 Those that violate articles 25 , 26 , and article 27 , clause 1 , items 2 and 4 should be given a warning by the industrial and commercial administration organs and other relevant administrative law enforcement organs .  Their illicit gains and illegal properties should be confiscated , and a fine equivalent to between one and three times the illicit gains should be imposed .  
What is more serious is that the funds had been raised at the expense of the bank 's legitimate status and reputation among the enterprises and the public in the society .  As the Beijiao Office of People 's Construction Bank of China , which should also be held responsible for the case , also sustained heavy losses , the state-owned commercial banks have naturally seen their reputation compromised to a serious extent .  
He Guoqiang , secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee , answered : Chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region .  The Chang Jiang golden waterways have linked Chongqing to both eastern and western regions .  Thus , Chongqing should serve as a bridge linking the east with the west and making them promote each other .  
While creating a model street for the " no fake goods in malls and shops " activity , Hunan Road of Gulou District in Nanjing City incorporated ideological and political work as well as spiritual civilization construction into commercial enterprise management and business operation in a lively and tangible manner , producing a set of experiences in double civilizations construction and turning a shabby , cluttered , and unknown street into a golden business location , a shopping paradise , and a national model street of no fake goods in just a few years .  
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
Hong Kong itself has an excellent environment for business operations , as demonstrated in its world-class commercial and financial services , the complete and efficient trade supplementary services , the modern infrastructure facilities , and the perfect system of rule by law ;  
The meeting held : Since a similar national televised and teleconference was held last year , most central and local media units have striven to separate news-reporting activities from commercial activities , and to separate news-covering and editing personnel from commercial departments , and attained remarkable results in this regard .  
Various news propaganda units should seize opportunities , and strive to explore and establish work mechanisms which are conducive for us to uphold the party 's basic principle and fundamental nature governing journalistic work , and which suit the market economy .  They should also establish effective mechanisms to ban the practice of journalists getting personal gains in the guise of making journalistic reports so as to truly fundamentally separate news-covering , editing , and reporting activities from commercial activities .  
criminal activities are on the rise in financial computer systems and e-commerce systems ; the CIH virus , BO hacker procedures , and other harmful databases have been spread far and wide .  Some hackers at home and abroad illegally intruded into information systems in important areas of China , attacking websites and stealing state or commercial secrets .  
A People 's Bank official spoke today in Beijing on cracking down on unauthorized fund gathering activities .  He said People 's Bank would take further steps to join with the industrial and commercial as well as the judicial departments and adopt stern measures to resolutely ban , investigate , and crack down on unauthorized fund gathering activities in an effort to preserve the stability of socioeconomic order .  
Those who hand in false documents or use other deceptive means to fraudulently obtain their registration , once discovered , must be promptly punished , to the point of having their business licenses suspended , by the industrial and commercial administrative organ .  
Currently China 's foreign bond issues are regulated primarily under the pertinent State Council regulations on further strengthening the macro control over the use of international commercial loans , the State Development Planning Commission 's circular on comprehensive planned management of foreign debts , and the People 's Bank of China 's " Measures Controlling the Internal Institutions ' Issuance of Foreign Currency-based Bonds , " and so on .  There is no systematic law or regulation controlling the issuance of debt instruments overseas , and we urgently need to improve the relevant laws and regulations .  
In the course of this reform , the position and role of commercial banks in the economic operation have been substantially elevated .  Meanwhile , the adequacy and accumulation of capital funds in the commercial banks seem to lag behind the rapid growth of their operational scale , so that the situation that the capital adequacy ratio is on the low side and fails to reach the appropriate level has emerged .  
Third , in April 1999 , the state decided to establish Xinda Assets Management Company , and in October the same year , three more assets management companies , Huarong , Changcheng , and Dongfang , were established .  They took over a considerable portion of bad assets formed by policy-related loans and those formed during the track-changing period so that the capital burdens of bad assets , which the state-owned commercial banks should write off or prepare to write off , have been lessened .  
Second , reform has led to the monetization of economy and the deepening of finance , the former distribution in kind was gradually changed to distribution in money at real market prices ( the recent reform to suspend welfare housing distribution is an example ) , and the simple and unitary financial product previously provided by commercial banks has become complex and diversified .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
Second , we should formulate scientific and rational policies to guide foreign commercial investment industries , enhancing foreign economic policy coordination , integrating the attraction of foreign capital with the readjustment of the industrial structure and with expanding exports and improving the level of technical development , and improving the nation 's overall competitiveness .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
The Changzheng rockets independently developed by China have attained the advanced level in the world in the aspects of technical functions and practicability .  Apart from meeting the demands of domestic clients , it has also entered the international commercial market for rocket launching and attained remarkable social and economic effectiveness .  
In particular , the several prohibitions laid down by the central authorities must be carried out .  That is , spouses and children of leading cadres at the provincial ( ministerial ) and prefecture ( bureau ) levels are prohibited from engaging in any commercial and business activities that may cause conflicts with the public interests within the scope under the administrative jurisdiction of those leading cadres ;  
Some Arab countries even appealed for halting diplomatic , economic , and trade relations with Israel or discontinuing the process of normalizing relations with Israel .  A few days ago Oman decided to shut down its commercial representative 's office in Tel Aviv and Israel 's commercial representative 's office in Muscat ;  
Since Chen Shui-bian took office , Taiwan 's economic environment has been worsening every day .  The outflow of large amount of capital and the " shifting " of industrial and commercial enterprises one after another to other countries have consumed more than half of the economic achievements painstakingly accumulated by the Taiwan people over the past 30-plus years .  On improving the cross-strait relations , Chen Shui-bian has only given some ambiguous remarks .  
State-owned enterprises in cities must transfer all primary and secondary schools , hospitals , and other social service organizations to unified planning and management by local governments .  For some time , funding needed for this purpose will be jointly shared by both the enterprise and the government before it is gradually transferred in its entirety to the government .  Some of the organizations can be transformed into commercial operations .  
In the past five years our army has completely fulfilled the strategic task of reducing its personnel by 500,000 , totally ceased all commercial activities of the armed forces and armed police , won great victory in the fight against floods in 1998 , organized with high standards the parade for the 50th anniversary of the PRC , defended national sovereignty , security , and the unity of the motherland , and preserved social stability , and thus provided a reliable guarantee for China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
The Consulate General of the People 's Republic of China Consulate in Chicago and the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , the largest independent , non-profit international affairs organization in the Midwest , recently held a joint reception at the Chinese consulate , which was attended by nearly one-hundred persons including members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , as well as persons from political , commercial , academic and media circles . 
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
Hong Kong holds a very favorable geographical position in the Asia-Pacific region .  While facing such an important business opportunity at present , if we neglected effective operation , become less insensitive to changes in surrounding areas , and weaken the commercial and trade activities , then Hong Kong 's economic strength will not be able to display its prominent role and Hong Kong may gradually decline in the tides of the times .  
Qian Qichen said : " During my visit , I also had the chance to have extensive contact and exchange with personalities from various circles , such as the US Congress , industrial and commercial enterprises , media , ethnic Chinese community , and community of Chinese people residing in the United States . They all expressed the wish to see China and the United States friendly to each other and that the bilateral relations between the two countries can develop steadily . " 
Dai Xianglong said : Deepening the reform of wholly state-owned commercial banks is key to the reform of China 's financial system .  In the next five years or so , China 's four commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state should be reformed into modern , large-scale commercial banks that are quite competitive in international financial markets .  
An analysis by a military expert of Taiwan Gao Xiongbo says : " Arms race is very costly .  Because Taiwan 's enterprises have a special background of relationship between the government and the commercial sector , most of them are leaning toward shortsightedness for immediate gain .  Taiwan 's industry is narrow and shallow and is fundamentally insufficient to support a wide-ranging and a long-term arms race .  
As the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are expecting to further open up economic and trade exchanges on both sides of the strait , a public figure of the Taiwan authorities recently issued a thought-provoking statement that the continued rising unemployment rate on the island and the unfavorable economic situation would affect the time to relax restrictions on the implementation of the " no haste , be patient " policy and the extent of implementing this policy .  
We must improve the administrative structures of legal entities in state-owned commercial banks , appoint supervisory councils , establish supervisory mechanisms in accord with the market economy , set up business associations in various financial sectors , and implement prudent accounting systems in conformity with international practices .  
At present , Taiwan is engulfed in political turbulence and continuous economic depression .  Large numbers of businesses have closed down or suspended operations , the unemployment rate is climbing higher and higher , and the people 's " pain index " continues to rise .  There is a universal call from various social circles on the Taiwan authorities to abandon the " Taiwan independence " ideology , stop political in-fighting , improve cross-strait relations , open three direct links [ postal , commercial , and air and shipping links ] , and concentrate on revitalizing the economy .  
Those ranked at the lowest level are novices , made up mostly by students .  They are considered a bit immature in terms of their skill , and they are inexperienced in warfare .  They need guidance from experienced members ; however , they are the most active and energetic ones .  They are suitable for attacking ordinary commercial websites when provided with technical guidance .  
tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , and smuggling activities have continued despite repeated attempts to prohibit them ; the phenomena of commercial fraud and debt evasion are becoming increasingly serious ; false financial statements and other behavior that violates financial and economic discipline are quite common ;  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Qian Qichen said : Developing cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and cooperation and materializing direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links suit the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the compatriots on both sides of the strait .  Striving to attain such objectives has become the common understanding of most parties , groups , and people on Taiwan .  
Judging from the surface , cross-strait relations remain calm and stable ; moreover , thanks to the hard efforts of the public as well as the industrial and commercial circles on the island who have been imposing pressure on the authorities , many man-made restrictions in Taiwan are forced to be relaxed , thus giving rise to an unprecedented upsurge of economic , trade , and cultural exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
Under the tidal wave of economic globalization , in order to become a financial and service center , Hong Kong must have a vast economic hinterland , an extensive commercial network , the richest business information in Asia , and a large number of qualified personnel ready to provide services to international investors .  
Meanwhile , various social circles also proposed ways to shake off Taiwan 's economic predicament , and urged the authorities to discard their " no haste , be patient " policy , and to open up the direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links at an early date .  They hope : The urgent problems of enhancing Taiwan 's economic development can be resolved through cross-strait exchanges and cooperation .  
At present , the people and the industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan are still restless and dissatisfied .  The principal reason is that the will of the people has been distorted and their confidence has been broken .  There are three specific manifestations of this situation :  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .  He hoped that Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles would play a greater role in developing the motherland 's western region and in promoting the common development of Hong Kong and the interior .  
The MAC also analyzed the obstacles to the operation of the three mini links .  It listed the following major factors leading to the failure in starting scheduled flights , in the normal operation of the commercial mechanism for commodity imports and exports , and in allowing mainland tourists into Kinmen and Matsu .  
On this basis , our party seized the opportune moment to creatively realize the socialist transformation of individual farming , handicraft industry , as well as capitalist industrial and commercial industries , destroyed the exploiting system and the exploiting class , and established the socialist system .  
In today 's world , the relationship between scientific discoveries , technological innovation , and commercialization and industrialization is increasingly close , and the period of time for transforming scientific achievements to real productive forces has become increasingly short .  Scientific and technological progress and innovations are increasingly critical factors in the development of a commercial society .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
In carrying out such special campaigns , quality inspection , industrial and commercial administration , public security , customs , and other relevant departments should coordinate closely with one another , work in cooperation , and make every possible effort to achieve major results .  
For instance , gratifying changes have emerged in the problem of commercial banks ' bad debts , which had been regarded as a " time bomb " by many financial experts at home and abroad : The central bank has announced that the rate of bad debts of state-owned commercial banks has started to fall since the fourth quarter of last year , and on average it dropped by 2.1 percentage points during the first six months of this year .  
In regard to the petroleum , coal , fireworks , small arms ammunition enterprises and other companies engaged in production of easily combustible and dangerous products ; in regard to the airport , train station , wharf , fuel reserve , and other large scale commercial markets , as well as theaters and other public sites ; and in regard to aircraft , trains , passenger automobiles , cargo ships , and other critical installations , we must strengthen investigation and supervision , formulating a truly feasible incident response plan .  
Industrial and commercial enterprises engaged in development projects in the agricultural sector are urged to adopt the industrialized management method of using companies to bring along the growth of rural households , while the practice of developing a modern agriculture by industrial and commercial enterprises through a large-scale " land encirclement " is not encouraged at the present stage .  
An informed person in Beijing said that because of weak foreign demand , the State Council has decided to continue the policy of expanding domestic demand in the second half of the year .  The Ministry of Finance will apply to the National People 's Congress next month for an additional issue of 50-billion yuan of constructive treasury bonds , and plans to distribute them to commercial banks in late October after the approval .  
He demanded that the broad ranks of cadres and employees working in the industrial and commercial administration sector nationwide perform their duties conscientiously , reinforce regulation and law enforcement , bravely act as defenders of the market , strive to open up a new prospect in industrial and commercial administration , and make new contributions to the establishment and maintenance of a good order of market economy and the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
While performing their duties , industrial and commercial administration personnel must be impersonal and incorruptible and enforce the law bravely .  They should be brave to make arrests , fulfill their regulatory function , and handle tough cases , waging a relentless war against all lawbreaking and criminal behavior .  
Overall , the contingent of staff of industrial and commercial administration departments we have today is good and a batch of excellent law enforcers who are brave to enforce the law , defy violence and brute force , and do not hesitate to lay down their lives have come to the fore .  
All industrial and commercial law enforcers must be faithful to their duty , be brave to take responsibility , and remain upright and incorruptible .  They should make a good job of market regulation and law enforcement by presenting a clean , honest , and lofty image ;  
On this occasion , on the issue of biological weapons , the Bush Administration uses the excuse that the stipulations of the draft agreement of the protocol , regarding verification and inspection , might threaten US commercial and military secrets , leading to the adoption of an opposition standpoint , in total disregard for the appeals and great efforts of the international community ; this has once again demonstrated that the Bush Administration is determined to obstinately cling to its course and disregard the opposition of the international community .  
It was learned that over the past 23 years , the PLA ocean-going space survey unit has completed a total of 39 ocean-going space survey missions , with its accident-free voyages accumulating to more than 620,000 nautical miles , and has successfully conducted a series of major national-level scientific experiments as well , aside from conducting ocean-going space survey and control for various commercial satellites launched by China for foreign clients .  
This is especially true following China 's entry to the WTO , when foreign agricultural produce of high quality will be entering the market at a much lower price , thus threatening the existence of traditional agriculture .  More farmers should be given the opportunity to engage in industrial and commercial undertakings .  
In accordance with the Regulations Governing the Administration of Recreational Establishments and on the basis of the principle of " protecting what is legitimate , cracking down on what violates the law , and banning what is illegal , " cultural , public security , industrial and commercial departments at all levels , as well as other functional departments , must resolutely ban recreational establishments that are engaged in illegal operations without a license or a complete license .  
The offshore organizations of commercial banks mentioned in the " Guide " refer to commercial banking organizations set up or acquired outside the border by wholly state-funded commercial banks and shareholding commercial banks .  They include organizations of commercial banks , banks subordinate to wholly state-funded banks , and shareholding and mutual shareholding banks listed in consolidated accounting statements .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
Starting from the fourth quarter of this year , the state-owned commercial banks are expected to increase consumption credit and loans , including those for purchasing residential units and cars .  The authorities hope that the purchases of residential units and cars will become one of the internal driving forces behind China 's steady and accelerating economic growth in the future .  
This method of getting enmeshed in a web of one 's own spinning has muzzled Taiwan 's economic vitality and competitiveness , with the result that Taiwan industrial and commercial enterprises have missed good opportunities for coming to the motherland to invest and run businesses , and the upgrading of Taiwan industries and change of economic pattern have been delayed , and this has also become one of the main reasons for Taiwan 's rapid and serious economic recession in the past year .  
The idea of establishing " three links " across the Taiwan strait , namely direct transport , postal , and commercial links , has been the urgent demand of the nongovernment public in Taiwan for many years , and it has now become an important variable for the candidates in influencing people 's voting trends in Taiwan 's presidential election , and affecting the overall situation in the election .  
At the same time China Airlines has established an office in Beijing through its US-registered " Sino-US Investment Company , " and it is now planning to set up offices in Shanghai , the main commercial city of central China , and Guangzhou , south China 's biggest window on the world , as its main bases for advancing on the mainland after direct flights commence .  
Therefore , China 's relevant departments have stipulated that in order to protect national interest and economic security , China 's companies are forbidden to buy products with encryption software designed by foreign countries and no domestic organization or individual shall sell foreign commercial encryption products .  
Ye Xuanping said that in the past year , the CPPCC National Committee has strengthened ties with personalities in various circles in Taiwan , made extensive contacts with people of the industrial and commercial circles there , and tried in all possible ways to solve problems and do solid work for Taiwan businessmen .  Besides , it has also severely repudiated the " two-state theory " dished out by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] and strongly condemned the Taiwan authorities ' acts of trying in vain to split up the motherland .

With regard to the grain varieties excluded from the scope of purchases at protective prices , grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises will be allowed to purchase grain in the rural areas after the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at prefectural ( city ) or county level .  
As to the grain varieties still within the scope of purchases at protective prices , the purchasing channels should also be appropriately widened to allow and encourage the grain consuming enterprises and marketing enterprises to directly purchase grain , subject to the examination and approval of the industrial and commercial administrative departments at provincial level , according to the state policies .  
2 .  It has vigorously developed multiple forms of commercial personal insurance as a major supplement for social security , which has played an important role in raising the social security level , and instituting and perfecting a social security system in China .  
Taiwan 's industrial and commercial circle , political sphere , scholars , and media were all disappointed , and even foreign businessmen also indicated their dissatisfaction .  Taiwan 's stock market continued to fall for straight five days .  The general index fell from 9,119 points on 19 May to 8430 points on 25 May , a fall of almost 700 points .  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
The four major economic trends to emerge in China pointed out by Premier Zhu made the patriots see the broad prospect of having opportunities to serve the motherland , made industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong grasp the endless business opportunities , and made the broad masses of compatriots in Hong Kong see the brilliant future of economic cooperation between Hong Kong and the hinterland .  
Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the positive role played by friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles in promoting economic cooperation between China 's interior and Hong Kong and common prosperity of the two places .  He expressed his appreciation for friends of Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles , who have the tradition of loving the country and Hong Kong by consistently putting the interests of the country and the nation before anything else .  
He hoped that friends of the industrial and commercial circles will continue to exert a positive influence , support the administration of the government of the special administrative region headed by Mr . Tung Chee-hwa , and further play their role in maintaining long-term stability and prosperity of the society in Hong Kong and further supporting the modernization drive in China 's interior .  
As an international financial , trade , and commercial center , the Hong Kong SAR has also covered a rough and rugged path in its economic development .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
Following the international custom , the PBOC branches organized more than 50,000 man-trips to inspect the quality of assets and genuine profit and loss of more than 38,000 financial institutions ( including branch offices ) in order to promote the improvement of internal management of commercial banks .  
The PBOC and the State Economic and Trade Commission recently issued a joint circular demanding that all commercial banks limit or halt loans to obsolete and backward production capacity , crafts , and products , and to duplicate construction projects .  
He said : Because China will soon join the WTO , is carrying out the strategy of large-scale development of western regions , and , in particular , has registered sustained and steady economic development , Japanese industrial and commercial circles have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for investment in China .  
Today 's video and telephone conference emphasized that from now on , the industrial and commercial administration departments at all levels should keep a tight control on the issue of licenses and turn down all applications from units and individuals who are actually involved in illegal MLM and disguised MLM activities in the name of sole distribution , agency marketing , authorized partnership , direct marketing , chain marketing , or network marketing .  
A person in charge of the Guangdong provincial industrial and commercial administration bureau said : From January to July this year , the industrial and commercial administration departments across the province listed a total of 37 cases of illegal MLM for investigation and handling and dispersed 3.28 million people involved in MLM .  
The fourth civil division has been set up to counter the situation that maritime cases and the commercial cases involving foreigners as well as Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots have increased by a large number along with the constant expansion of opening-up .  With this division , the trial work will take up the challenge from economic globalization .  
According to the demands of the CCDI and the Central Commission for Judicial , Procuratorial , and Public Security Work , as revealed by people in the know , after September there will be a cleanup and rectification of the law enforcement contingent aside from the successive announcement of the outcome of major and important cases with an impact .  A large number of discipline violators and unqualified personnel in industrial and commercial administration , taxation , customs , and other departments will be dismissed or laid off .  
In October the same year , the Bank of China promulgated the " Notice Concerning Risk Control by Commercial Banks While Handling International Settlement of Forward Letters of Credit . " It provides that " commercial banks , in handling their forward letters of credit business , must strictly follow state policies for foreign exchange control and the use of foreign capital , and they must have a genuine background of commodity trade . "  The notice also requires commercial banks to establish sound mechanisms for internal management and control .  
Chen Guangyi said : While constantly deepening reform and accelerating restructuring , we should now continue to implement the proactive fiscal policy and maintain the necessary efforts .  The State Council has proposed that 50 billion yuan of additional long-term treasure bonds for raising construction funds be issued by the Ministry of Finance through commercial banks in the second half of this year , and the central budget be readjusted accordingly .  The proposed measures are necessary .  
Commenting on the issues of direct cross-strait postal , commercial , and transport links [ hereafter termed as the " three links " ] during a meeting with a Taiwan Lien-Ho Pao delegation in Beijing in late August , Qian Qichen , vice premier of the State Council , pointed out : So long as Taiwan authorities acknowledge that cross-strait exchanges of air and shipping services will be conducted within the domestic flight and shipping routes of a single country , relevant concrete problems can be easily resolved .

People from points south flocked there to do business , making it second only to P'ingtung itself as a commercial center . The town became the central market for farmers to sell their red beans , betel nuts , coconuts , and other local specialities , from where they were sold wholesale to other markets .  
In the late 1970 ' s the local film scene acquired a new look . The Motion Picture Development Foundation film library , founded in 1978 with the support of the Government Information Office , began to systematically introduce famous European films and top-notch local works to its members . And starting in 1980 , an international film festival has been held every year in conjunction with the Golden Horse Awards to show foreign art films ( together with some high-standard commercial films ) nominated for the awards .  
The " superstar " art objects that go for astronomical prices are almost all the focus of intense promotion by auction houses intended to stir up a competitive psychology among buyers . Many less ballyhooed works of nearly equal artistic value , overlooked in the commercial furor , sell for quite pedestrian prices .  
A total of 653 international direct-dial public telephones will be installed at a wide variety of locations , including airports , harbors , train stations , tourist hotels , airline companies , tourist spots , large hospitals , major streets in commercial districts , universities , highway rest stops , industrial science parks , foreign affairs and trade centers , international activity centers , and the directorate 's main business offices .  
It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
In time to come , it will be comparable in size to the central commercial sectors of Taichung and Tainan . And the volume of economic activity in Hsinchu 's commercial sector will increase more than threefold . ( 4 ) Hsiang Shan Mountain City will become a scenic residential district .  
In the process of moving from underdevelopment to prosperity , the simple , unspoilt Polynesians were not as good at business as the Chinese - - the French government helped them set up a consumer coop , but it had to shut down , while the Chinese were spread over all the islands , forming a broad commercial network that even the French themselves could n't compete with .  
Chinoiserie , the vogue for Chinese-style interior decoration , furniture , porcelain and textiles that swept Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries , has sometimes been explained as blatant imitation of Chinese products , as freely creative art with China as its inspiration , or even as the product of commercial protectionism aimed at keeping Chinese exports out of contemporary markets .  
According to research by Hsia Li-ming associate professor at Taitung Normal College , there is a marked difference between Chinese imperial maps , produced to meet the political and military requirements of the court , and European navigation charts of the same period , where the commercial interest is foremost .  
Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
Capt . Wang Feng-tien , chief of the supervisory office for second-generation warships says : " The weaponry and electronic warfare systems aboard a warship are varied and complicated . Everything has to be more precise than on merchant ships , from pipe-fitting to welding . There are two to three times the amount of welds , cabling and piping on a 4,000 tonne naval ship as on a 14O , 000 tonne commercial vessel . "  
At noon on May 15,1911 , a riot broke out in the Northern industrial city of Torreon . Three hundred Chinese - - about half the city 's Chinese community - - were killed ; in 1915 , there was a disturbance in another and the mad rioters looted the commercial district murdering over 200 Chinese . In July of the same year , Mexican revolutionary troops and their impoverished supporters pillaged 40 large-scale Chinese owned businesses in Cananea . According to statistics their losses amounted to US $ 5.3 million .  
What disturbed the Mexican people was the presence of another group who had entered the Northern Territory as common laborers on the newly opening land but who through their mutual aid and commercial savvy were able to shed their status as slaves and emerge as a class of " small capitalists " in little more than ten years . Starting with restaurants , laundry shops , and grocery stores and moving on to shoe factories , and garment factories , the Chinese carved out a definite niche for themselves in the economy of northern Mexico .  
With a simple and honest look of a farmer , matched with authentic Taiwanese and heavily accented Mandarin , he was extremely effective at using local flavor to add to the persuasiveness of the commercial . "  
Basically speaking , we use a collage or cut-and-paste postmodern method , using the technique to strengthen a consumer 's impression of a commercial , " explains Hsu Shun-ying , who is creative director at the Yi Shi Hsing Tai Agency , which is responsible for Stimoral 's ads . The choice of Taiwanese as a piece of the collage was done in the hope of fostering identification with the product through using the current way young people talk . " Are n't young people today all part of a bilingual Mandarin-Taiwanese generation ? "  
Pacific Construction , a real estate company chain that adopted a lot of parks , found itself scolded by some city council members as engaged in advertising and commercial activities , maybe because its signs were too conspicuous . " We thought we were going to raise our corporate image , and instead we spent all that money and wound up getting yelled at , " they say , feeling much abused .  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
Then there are those harshly judgmental types in " little theater " who feel the groups like Ping-Fong Acting Troupe and the Performance Workshop are practically commercial in nature and that they make use of superficial political clich ? s and catchwords to create an " overripe , saturated urban space " that 's pretty to look at and easy to digest but lacking in substance .  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
Some , holding that the many items relating to satellite communication technology involved national defense facilities , harbored suspicions that the Chinese communists had " evil intentions . " While economically there might be some small profits to be made , they feared that the national defense would be seriously damaged . Others thought that mainland research that had led to defense technology was far removed from commercial technology that could be profitably sold in the marketplace . They doubted whether Taiwan could use the Chinese communists ' strengths to improve R . O . C . technology .  
But placing so much importance on marriage and the family has n't made modern Chinese more willing to cleave together as couples . On the contrary , with the change from an agricultural society to a commercial and industrial one with an international orientation , more and more couples are living apart for the sake of pursuing a better future .  
Liang Chia-chen , a commercial secretary in the Ministry of Economic Affairs currently assigned to Belgium , is a female " single noble . " She does n't hide the fact that she 's never been very serious about getting married precisely because it might affect her chances of foreign assignments in the future .  
The problem of creativity in Taiwan films lies in the fact that the proletarian class is attached to Hong Kong and Hollywood films that are sensory stimulation , while elite culture is still separated by too large a gap . We have lost middle-of-the-road commercial entertainment , " argues Chiao . Ang Lee proves the potential of the middle road .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
When the government came to Taiwan over 40 years ago , power was in the hands of those labelled as being from " outside the province . " The main industrial and commercial businesses , and economic power , were also primarily " mainlander . " This meant that chairmen , directors and other important leadership posts were largely held by mainlanders , so as to establish good ties between business and the central government .  
In the 1983 elections to expand the Legislative Yuan , the Taipei branch of the KMT broke away from the former stereotyped dogmatic approach , and for the first time used the techniques of commercial advertising to present a packaged image in straightforward , accessible language . This also marked the first time that a commercial advertising agency was brought across the divide into political advertising .  
Luxe has a sixteen-year history of eel farming behind it , with the major market for that product being Japan . It was through familiarity with Japan that the company discovered that Japanese also are very fond of moth orchids . Given the definite market there , the company decided that moth orchids were suitable for large scale commercial production .  
Hoping to escape the growing vulgarization manifested in the spread of floats carrying electric organs and commercial bands playing Western music , and wanting to restore the simplicity of traditional belief , Chien Chin-hui broke away from the established way of doing things whereby everything was in the hands of the temple management committee , and instead commissioned Lin Teh-fu , director of the Ilan County Cultural Center , and Lin Mao-hsien , a scholar of folk customs , to assist in organizing the activities .  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition . Mainland manufacturers still offer too few styles , and use outdated materials . They are not like Taiwan firms , which can afford to bring in superior , more durable materials from abroad .  
Furthermore , deeper investigation is required into many questions , such as how many shark species are currently commercially fished and exploited , which commercial shark species ' populations are falling because of both shark meat and shark fin consumption and which purely due to demand for shark fins , and which real shark species ' fins are actually referred to by such shark fin market terminology as " white fin , " " black fin , " " Luzon yellow " or " tailhook . "  
Taipei is also a place where construction is crude and lacks any aesthetic sense , where the first ones to tear down historic buildings come out ahead , and where residential and commercial space is mixed together chaotically . Hsia Chu-joe , a professor in the Graduate Institute of Building and Planning at National Taiwan University , describes Taipei as " sticky cake " : Neither officials nor urban planners can do anything with it .  
Under these conditions , " Taipei 's urban policies bent to the prevailing winds , allowing commercial activities to spread into residential areas , turning a blind eye to illegal structures , and implementing the law ' flexibly , ' " says Deng Tsung-de , also at NTU 's Building and Planning school .  
The earliest Chinese urban plan , from the Zhou dynasty ( 1122 BC to 255 BC ) , states that cities should be square , have three gates on each side and nine main roads running parallel both horizontally and vertically , and provide key sites for various temples and a commercial district .  
Liang Kuo-lung feels that despite these disadvantages , as a small town photographer Wu Chin-miao was able to go beyond the level of a mere artisan . He showed imagination in composition and a keen feel for capturing the moment , and he left behind many photographs with an individuality of style , which although they were taken as commercial photographs , are moving and worth more than a passing glance .  
In Kaohsiung , factories in the industrial district begin spewing out smoke of a strange color . In office buildings in the city 's commercial district , air conditioning units large and small come to a halt . It becomes impossible for more than 300,000 households in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung area to generate the enticing smells of food being cooked . . . .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
It 's hard to know a dog 's heartHuang Hui-pi states emphatically that the entire process of managing street dogs , including sterilization , mercy killing and monitoring commercial breeders , requires the assistance of veterinarians . Nevertheless , the training process of veterinary medicine lacks a fitting understanding of canine population expansion .  
Income and independenceMany people think of taxi driving as an excellent " reception center for the unemployed and waystation for those changing jobs . " One just has to pass the test to get a commercial driver 's license and sign up with a cab company , and one can immediately get on the road and start earning money .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Quite the opposite from what outsiders suspected , the principal reason for prolonging talks was in fact claims of " unfair commercial advantages . " The seemingly sensitive questions of sovereignty and political rivalry were actually secondary .  
After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
However , the Japanese scholar " did not have any commercial interest , but on the contrary brought respect and affirmation to aboriginal culture . But the fact that Enigma earned huge profits from record sales-the album with Difag 's singing on it sold five million copies-has caused virtually everyone in Taiwan to think only in terms of what profit there is to be had . This seems to reflect some special feature of Taiwan 's culture , " Ming says , his voice tinged with regret . Return to innocence  
Frictional unemployment usually is voluntary . Just a few years ago , when the economy was bubbling and industries like commercial services , finance and insurance , information technology , construction , and national infrastructure were growing rapidly , they could absorb all the " floating " manpower , and frictional unemployment was not a serious problem .  
However , patriotic sentiment takes second place to commercial considerations . The NTU researchers successfully developed shoot tip culture and stem cutting propagation methods for Actinidia , but the dominant position which New Zealand had already established for itself was seen as leaving no opportunity for Taiwan to enter the market , so the idea of developing the kiwifruit as a commercial crop was abandoned . NTU has merely continued with variety collection and research .  
North-South cooperation But what of mainland China , the real homeland of the mihoutao ? Having woken up to the fact that what had been considered a very ordinary wild fruit actually has an export earnings potential far beyond what anyone could have imagined years ago , in recent years the mainland has started making strenuous efforts to make up lost ground by setting up research establishments and commencing commercial cultivation .  
But Legislative Yuan members , local politicians and landowners rushed en masse to intervene , and the plan to " resurrect " Shihmen 's water sources was thrown out by the Ministry of the Interior . In August this year , after the disastrous typhoon , the residential , commercial and recreational zones around the Shihmen Reservoir were finally reduced in size .  
In early December of last year , the Public Television Broadcasting Law was first placed on the Legislative Yuan 's agenda , and the legislators started discussing its every provision . Those legislators who support the law say that the TV programs we currently have are hardly up to snuff . The ones to be blamed for Taiwan 's questionable quality of culture are commercial TV stations . In order not to let Taiwan 's programming be devoured by alien pop culture , we need a public television station to produce high-quality shows .  
Yang Hsien-hung left PTV because of the perpetual delays in starting operation , and he is now serving as the news department manager at Formosa Television , Taiwan 's fourth broadcast TV station , scheduled to begin broadcasting next year . Yang believes that as long as it does not compromise with governmental or commercial forces , PTV news will be quite competitive , because " their rivals are very weak ! "  
As far as Hong Kong residents are concerned , the pragmatic approach typical of businessmen suits the colony 's long-established role as a commercial center . As for Taiwan , Tung 's family has long had connections with high-level political figures in the ROC , giving rise to some optimism about what will happen after he takes over the reins of officialdom in Hong Kong . It is believed that Tung understands Taiwan relatively well , a fact which should be helpful in future communication and compromise .  
But associate professor Wang Li-chih of National Taiwan University 's forestry department is not worried that introduced rhododendrons will become dominant species and squeeze out other plants . The hybrid rhododendron cultivars , in which particular features are developed for commercial purposes , actually have weaker constitutions than naturally occurring varieties , and rhododendrons generally choose land " abandoned " by other species : on fertile ground , rhododendron can not necessarily compete with other plants in the wild .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
Modern radio people are a diverse group : senior broadcaster Luo Hsiao-yun often hosts press conferences for pop stars ( top left ) ; Su Lai , who was originally a pop star himself , likes radio work because he gets to play music and talk about his emotions ( bottom left ) ; Li Ming-jou , a hot young radio show host , makes a commercial endorsement ( above ) .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total . The volume of imported materials and exported finished products will total 1.3 million tonnes per year , which will help Taichung Harbor develop into a major international commercial port .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
Li Yih-yuan has discovered that the logic of the almanacs-to seek safety through knowing when to act and when not to-has , in modern commercial society , been transformed . It has been adapted to daily life , especially to the pragmatic pursuit of profit .  
The post-martial-law atmosphere has formed the Taiwan alternative music we see today . Within the music industry system , Magic Stone Records , which used to be an alternative label , has chosen a path between underground and commercial record company operation . They have chosen the good and discarded the bad in both business modes and have carved out an alternative business path which is one of the phenomena worthy of note accompanying this wave .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
Serving cheap but generous portions of good-quality , simple food with the authentic flavor of back home became the forte of dependents ' village eateries . Compared with the fashion in today 's catering industry for creating a trendy marketing image through commercial design and advertising , they seem to give especially good value for money , which is why so many experienced eaters-out are always on the lookout for them . But with the march of time , many of these little eateries are closing down or moving .  
As written in Introduction to the Cultural History of China : " With the stability of centralized government and the establishment of civil administration , political problems were gradually resolved . But the end of equal distribution of wealth within farming settlements , and the burgeoning of commercial enterprise , led many people to focus on the issue of society 's widening economic gap . "  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them . The reason is very simple . " The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . " According to Liu , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
It is one a.m . and the rhythms of techno music pulsate through a pub in the Hsinyi commercial district . Young people , filled with perhaps more than simple youthful energy , some wearing white gloves or waving fluorescent light sticks , bop around on a tiny dance floor bathed in black fluorescent light . Waving their hands in time with the music , they look like they are conducting some sort of intense pantomime .  
Before Kaohsiung was founded , Tungkang was southern Taiwan 's primary commercial harbor . But World War II devastated the wealthy sections of the town . Tungkang was left a virtual ruin , and no trace of the town 's Japanese-occupation-era prosperity remains . Arriving from Pingtung or Kaohsiung , all one sees is a typical fishing village-a harbor populated by a few boats , a great deal of fishing tackle and betelnuts .  
She had been acting as if she had come down with Alzheimer 's after the earthquake , she recalls , drifting along dazed and confused . Her mind is much clearer these days . She used to be quite timid , she says , but upon seeing a television microphone now , she jokes , echoing a TV commercial , " I am not scared of that thing anymore ; you can bring it closer . "  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
As a matter of fact , after assuming the KMT chairmanship in March 2000 , Lien Chan stated that after a comprehensive examination of party assets and commercial investments , it had been discovered that during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , when Liu Tai-ying was director-general of the KMT 's Investment and Business Management Committee , there were eight highly controversial investment cases with combined total losses of NT $ 9.8 billion .  
In the past , except for special industry databases , sources such as online news sites and all kinds of personal web pages provided an endless wealth of freely accessible information for people browsing the web , leaving little room for the survival of commercial web sites . Even portal sites such as Yam , and Yahoo 's Taiwan subsidiary Kimo , which claimed to have millions of subscribers , were frustrated by their lack of an " excuse " to charge fees .  
Every shot in A Journey of Impressions is like an individual photograph . The camera work has great feeling , and in concert with the relaxing and rhythmic musical soundtrack , it brought the documentary happily into the realm of reportage . The show also broke new ground for social-education programming by selling all of its commercial slots .  
But commercial considerations aside , as mainland media professionals are hoping , media from outside the mainland should not just play the role of furthering business . A more exciting question and one worth waiting for and answer is : Can the media culture fostered in the free environments of Hong Kong and Taiwan capable of stimulating mainland China in a positive way ?  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
" Although you could n't really say that the number of contracts actually signed is huge , we 're setting ourselves up for the future as a kind of consultant , helping integrate and strengthen each individual client according to their respective distribution weaknesses , " says Choice Group vice-chairman Jimmy Cheng . Choice also plan to set up a new arm , providing specialist help to Taiwanese publishers through their in-depth knowledge of the particular political and commercial environment of the mainland .  
Since economic reform began here in the 1990s , Shanghai has become China 's most dynamic boomtown , and today the main commercial districts are more glittering than ever before . Into this city have flooded the best Taiwanese restaurants of all types , offering everything from affordable day-to-day fare to recreational fashion cuisine to high-end gastronomic delicacies , forming a veritable " Taiwanese school " of no small weight and status .  
Lin Pen-hsuan , assistant professor at the Institute of Sociology at Nanhua University , reminds us that in this extremely commercialized world , people have moved from viewing the body as taboo , then opening up to an acceptance of it , to seeing that it can be manipulated and played around with . From beauty treatments and body sculpting to sexual promiscuity , the body is often packaged into a variety of discourses and commercial ends . Is there no escape from all of this , even in death ?  
Back in the days when cities relied on rail transport , train stations were catalysts for commercial development . But thanks to Changhua 's geography , while the nice plain to the east of the station became a thriving commercial and residential area , the western side stayed so quiet you can just about see tumbleweeds roll past .  
The Vice Premier noted that China and Nepal , as two developing nations , are economically complementary He hoped industrial and commercial circles of the two countries could work out more projects with less investment and quick results to benefit the peoples , and enhance a steady development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation  
iran and slovenia also agreed to establish air links between tehran and ljubljana , the slovenian capital , as well as + cultural , scientific , commercial and economic ties , + the radio said

Lack of capital and technological capacities hinder the development of adequate commercial energy supplies , with consequent deleterious effects on economic and social development .  
Because of the widespread and increasing use of commercial energy in all economic sectors of modern societies , various concerns have often been expressed about the adequacy of reserves and resources to meet future demand .

Examples were given of independent oral undertakings established in the context of individual relationships of a commercial or noncommercial nature , which might be valid under applicable rules of national law .  
A specific aspect of this development especially worried the international community : the major troubled debtors were large , middleincome economies that owed the bulk of their debts to the top commercial banks of the key industrialized countries .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
During this year the international community has viewed with deep concern and alarm the approval by the United States Congress of legislative initiatives to move the economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba to unimaginable levels , particularly the new extraterritorial dimensions that the most conservative circles in the Congress want to give to a policy that , since its inception , has been designed to impose United States law on third States .  
On the contrary , in a wide range of forums we have rejected unilateral coercive measure that affect the well-being of peoples , hamper free trade , and are alien to universally recognized commercial practices .  
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .  
Building upon political and economic stability , ambitious mechanisms for integration have been designed that contribute to consolidating the opening of our economies , the transparency of our markets , and the growth of commercial exchange with other regions in short , the creation of the conditions necessary to secure a better future for our peoples .  
At the same time , the legal regime develops apace , as experts learn simultaneously to apply multiple sets of norms from such diverse areas as commercial law , civil law , environmental law , international economic law , the law of the sea , public and private international law and mining law .  
Developing industrial and non-industrial planted forests in order to support and promote national ecologically sound afforestation and reforestation / regeneration programmes in suitable sites , including upgrading of existing planted forests of both industrial and non-industrial and commercial purpose to increase their contribution to human needs and to offset pressure on primary / old-growth forests .

The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
Unless women 's human rights , as defined by international conventions and standards , are fully applied , interpreted and enforced in civil , penal and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist only in name .  
Conduct educational campaigns to encourage women to use their purchasing power as consumers to promote the production of environmentally safe products and encourage them to invest in environmentally sound and productive agricultural , commercial and industrial activities .  Strategic objective K . 3 .  Establish mechanisms at the national ,  
Despite encouraging progress achieved over the past two decades in energy efficiency , especially in industrialized countries , global demand for commercial energy is projected to continue to grow in the coming years , with the main momentum coming from developing countries .  
Travel costs for the military and civilian personnel have been calculated on the basis of the following travel rates : ( a ) for repatriation of military contingent personnel , by group travel arrangements , at a rate of $ 540 per person ; and ( b ) for international civilian personnel , by commercial arrangements , at a rate of $ 3,500 per person one way or $ 7,000 round trip , inclusive of the entitlement for excess unaccompanied baggage .  
The survey states , for example , that bilateral and multilateral aid agencies , international organizations , private foundations , universities and commercial companies and national Governments are involved in the financing of international biotechnology initiatives for developing countries .  
During its special session ( 6-17 February 1995 ) on energy for rural development , the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development noted that adequate energy inputs were required for increased standards of living and productivity of human labour and for income generation in rural areas in developing countries where , on the eve of the twenty-first century , 2.5-billion people still have little or no access to commercial energy supplies and electricity .  
The overexpenditure under this heading was a result of higher requirements for standard troop cost reimbursement ( $ 171,000 ) due to the delayed departure of the Finnish contingent in December 1993 , to additional ration costs ( $ 78,000 ) to replenish UNDOF 's provisions inventory to a level sufficient to sustain operations while newly sought commercial ration contracts were being established , and to slightly higher than anticipated travel costs ( $ 8,000 ) .  
Eight workshops on ( i ) application of commercial quality standards for perishable produce in countries in transition of central and eastern Europe ( 2 ) ; ( ii ) topics of interest to countries in transition of central and eastern Europe , as determined by the Timber Committee ( 4 ) ; and ( iii ) topics of interest to countries in transition of central and eastern Europe , as determined by the Joint FAO / ECE / ILO Committee on Forest Technology , Management and Training ( 2 ) .  
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
It includes extremist but none the less influential sectors which , for ideological as well as economic reasons , will be eager to employ this new weapon in their ongoing campaign to disrupt Cuba 's mutually beneficial commercial relations with third countries .  
With the institution of SICA , integration is no longer sectoral that is , commercial and economic but comprehensive , meaning that it extends to the economic , social , cultural and political spheres and seeks to promote their harmonious and balanced development .  
In assessing costs for example of human resource development investments , the family decision-making structure will take into account inhibiting as well as motivating factors affecting their decisions to invest time in the schooling of girls , the opportunity costs of lost household or other ( e.g . agricultural , smallholding or commercial ) labour , or cultural / psychological stress on individuals as a consequence of non-traditional occupational or " career " choices .  
I am pleased to annex hereto for your information the text of decision 360 , entitled " Rejection of renewed attempts by the Congress of the United States of America to tighten the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba " , which was adopted on 13 July 1995 at the twenty-first regular session of the Council of the Latin American Economic System , held at the ministerial level in San Salvador , El Salvador .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
Not only their population growth but also urbanization and other changes in living standards and lifestyles stimulate the shift of energy use from traditional to commercial fuels , particularly oil and electricity .  84 / None the less , in the developing countries as a whole , per capita consumption of commercial energy is expected to remain less than one fifth of that in the developed countries in 2010 : in sub-Saharan Africa it will be less than one thirtieth of the North American level .  
Unless the human rights of women , as defined by international human rights instruments , are fully recognized and effectively protected , applied , implemented and enforced in national law as well as in national practice in family , civil , penal , labour and commercial codes and administrative rules and regulations , they will exist in name only .  
Review national laws , including customary laws and legal practices in the areas of family , civil , penal , labour and commercial law in order to ensure the implementation of the principles and procedures of all relevant international human rights instruments by means of national legislation , and revoke any remaining laws that discriminate on the basis of sex and remove gender bias in the administration of justice ;  
In line with its support for General Assembly resolution 49 / 9 , the Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba and considers it a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , lacking acceptable justification in current international affairs .  
Some countries , such as Morocco , South Africa , Tunisia , Uganda and Zimbabwe , have seen an increased inflow of private capital ; in 1994 , for example , South Africa recorded the first net capital inflow since 1984 , comprising mainly commercial bank loans and public and private international bond issues . 
NULLAlthough special programmes and specialized financial institutions are important , their limited coverage means that a sustained impact on the problem of underfunding of micro-enterprises and SMEs calls for more active involvement of commercial banks , which tend to exclude this portion of the population because of the conviction that it is too costly to service .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
The growth of a dynamic private enterprise sector should be underpinned by an appropriate economic , fiscal and legal framework with the following essential features : stable and predictable policies ; tax , monetary and trade policies that ensure adequate incentives for investment ; and a legal system which protects property rights and commercial contracts .  
That this serious problem should necessitate strengthened efforts on the international debt strategy was acknowledged at the mid-term review , and a number of actions were agreed upon in the areas of official bilateral debt , multilateral debt , and commercial debt .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 and 49 / 9 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
a similar vein , recognizing that information provided in notifications may , in certain instances , be proprietary and sensitive for commercial reasons , the information provided shall be treated as confidential and restricted to the Commission and IAEA , to the extent that this is consistent with their respective responsibilities under Security Council resolution 715 ( 1991 ) , other relevant resolutions and the plans .  
The immediate effects of the beginning of the war in 1991 were as follows : the tourist market was depressed as a result of the lack of security ; many hotels and private accommodations were occupied by displaced persons and refugees ; commercial and communication links were immediately cut from the north ; and routes inland towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were blocked . 
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

Suspiciously enough , these events come together at one point : the passing by the United States Congress of the infamous piece of legislation aimed at definitively blockading Cuba from the rest of the world , when over 35 years of a cruel and ever-worsening economic , commercial and financial blockade have failed and has been condemned year after year by this sovereign Assembly .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
The strengthening of this protection in the form of a multilateral instrument , for instance , could permit judicial prosecution to go beyond national borders and for the illicit commerce in children and their commercial sexual exploitation to be categorized as crimes against humanity , that is , that they be considered indefensible under the Convention on the Non-applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity of 26 November 1968 .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
In an international environment characterized by the exacerbation of commercial , financial and cultural competition , in which international aid is becoming scarcer , strengthening the endogenous capacities of Africa is a healthy imperative to allow our continent to take its destiny into its own hands .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Grave concerns have been expressed that despite the worldwide call for an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba , this embargo not only continues but has been further strengthened and extended since the Helms-Burton Act was promulgated in March this year .  
Russia , firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and international navigation , supports and intends to broaden normal economic and commercial ties with Cuba , based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage , and to put them into effect in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
Since 1991 , official development assistance for Africa has been shrinking , and direct foreign investments remain weak in a very difficult international context that is marked by a fierce commercial competition that the Uruguay agreements have made even more onerous for the African countries .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
Each nation is responsible for itself and must create , through rigorous public management and compliance with its legislative rulings , optimum conditions for freeing private initiative , a factor in economic and commercial progress .  
Bangladesh welcomed the adoption of the Stockholm Declaration and Agenda for Action , which embodied practical commitments and priorities for action at the national , regional and international levels for preventing the commercial sexual exploitation of children , and for protecting and reintegrating the children who were its victims . 
The World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children , held in Stockholm in August 1996 , had greatly contributed to that awareness , as had the tragic deaths in Belgium the previous summer of young teenagers who had been sexually abused , which had shattered the myth that only children in developing countries fell prey to commercial sexual exploitation . 
Traditionally , non-governmental organizations have played an important role by providing information and services to those segments of society not addressed by official governmental programmes , such as the poor , adolescents , commercial sex workers , unmarried couples and men , or by focusing on sensitive or controversial issues , such as traditional harmful practices against women , violence against women and abortion .  
Perhaps 80 per cent of global exposure to particulate air pollution occurs indoors in developing countries and a disproportionate share of exposure to this serious health hazard is borne by women who do the cooking and by children who are indoors with their mothers .  This extremely difficult situation in the developing world is to a very large extent the result of relatively low consumption of modern commercial energy .  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Urges the international community , particularly the creditor countries and multilateral institutions , as well as commercial banks and other lending institutions , when continuing the implementation of various measures aimed at contributing to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as when exploring the need for additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the external debt and debt-service burden of developing countries , to ensure that the debt strategy evolved through the years is fully implemented and taken into account ;  
In particular , it established rules of substantive law governing two aspects that were of central importance to the commercial utility of those instruments : the independence of the undertaking from the underlying transaction , and the establishment of rules that would apply in instances of fraudulent calling of the undertaking .  
Additionally , at the international level , commercial private-sector efforts to follow up UNCED are promoted by such groups as the International Network for Environmental Management in Germany and the Business Council for Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) in Switzerland . BCSD has established task forces on , inter alia , internalizing social and environmental costs in prices , and conducting a global study on the environmentally sound production and use of paper .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
The continuing presence of the international civilian personnel and local staff in the mission area during the withdrawal period is required to provide uninterrupted administrative support to the contingents and to ensure the recovery , collection , disposal and shipment of the United Nations-owned and leased assets , hand-over of rented premises , and settlement of commercial contracts and agreements with the local vendors . 
To achieve broad-based cooperation against drug trafficking by sea , Governments were invited to encourage commercial carriers and professional groups active in maritime transport to become involved in the fight against illicit drug traffic , on the basis of voluntary cooperation and memoranda of understanding at the national and international levels , as well as through training to increase the awareness of maritime transport personnel with regard to illicit drug trafficking .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
On the contrary , this threat is an inevitable consequence of the activities of organizations that deny the State its legitimate monopoly of violence , corrupt State institutions , undermine the rule of law , threaten the integrity of financial and commercial sectors of society , contravene legal and social norms and conventions , transgress national sovereignty and violate national borders . 
During the consultations the following items proposed by some delegations in 1995 for possible inclusion in the agenda of the Subcommittee at its future sessions had been discussed : the status of the five outer space treaties ; commercial aspects of space activities , for example , property rights , insurance and liability ; a review of existing norms of international law applicable to space debris ; legal aspects of space debris ; and a comparative review of the principles of international space law and international environmental law .  
A major objective of this subprogramme is to provide Governments and legislators with universally acceptable , modern and harmonized treaties and model laws in areas where harmonization of commercial law is desirable and feasible , and also to provide commercial parties with non-legislative texts ( e.g . model clauses , rules and legal guides ) to assist them in implementing international transactions . 
ECLAC studies in international trade , transportation and the financing of development focused on the design of policies and mechanisms to foster the continued expansion and improvement of the commercial linkages of Latin America and the Caribbean with the changing world economy , particularly in view of the current trends towards globalization in production and increasing liberalization of trade and finance .  
In reporting the results of action taken pursuant to General Assembly resolution 50 / 223 , the Secretary-General is concerned principally to convey the fact that , as compared with the situation two years ago , it is now evident that the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peace-keeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  
INFOTERRA , the Global Environmental Information Exchange Network , is operating through 171 government-designated national focal points ; a network of 8,000 sources of information , including national and international institutions , non-governmental organizations , industrial and commercial enterprises , academic institutions and experts ; 34 special sectoral sources , and 10 regional service centres .  
Economic and environmental questions : reports of subsidiary bodies , In decision 1996 / 305 , the Council decided to continue consideration of agenda item 6 ( i ) , including the draft resolution entitled " Corruption and bribery in transnational commercial activities " ( E / 1996 / L . 26 ) , at its resumed substantive session of 1996 , and also requested the President of the Council to continue to facilitate open-ended consultations prior to its resumed substantive session , with a view to enhancing the prospects for achieving consensus . 
On 2 November 1995 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 10 , entitled " Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba " , in which it requested the Secretary-General , in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system , to prepare a report on the implementation of the resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-first session .  
At the eleventh summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , the heads of State or Government " called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to the principle of neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage " .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
Under the new initiative it would be determined after the initial three-year period whether Naples terms , together with comparable relief by non-Paris Club bilateral donors and commercial creditors , would be sufficient to put the country in a sustainable debt-service position .  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
The order covers basic , decentralized vocational training and education in Greenland in the following main areas : metalworking ; construction ; commercial and clerical trades ; food trades ; fisheries ; social services ; health services ; graphic trades ; service trades .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The effects on the mental and psychological health of children subject to commercial sexual exploitation are not easy to diagnose , and can be healed only through expensive and prolonged treatment .  
For while having children trapped in certain unhealthy working conditions may be far from ideal , simply closing this door to children without providing them with viable alternatives may drive them deeper underground into the much more hazardous world of commercial sexual exploitation ;  
It is noteworthy that , while some Member States may have expressed reservations with respect to this or other provisions of the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States on a variety of grounds , they have nonetheless expressed through the European Community 's statements and elsewhere their objection to the Helms-Burton legislation , so extreme and unjustified is its interference with their sovereign decision to maintain normal economic and commercial relations with Cuba .  
Foreign proceeding means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in a foreign State in which proceeding the asset and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court or other competent authority , for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation [ provided that the debts were not incurred predominantly for household or other personal rather than commercial purposes ] ;  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Furthermore , there was general agreement that the incentives regarding commercial value , contained in some national salvage law , should not be included in the future instrument ; that warships should be excluded from the scope of application of the instrument ; that an approach based on flag State jurisdiction , and port State jurisdiction , supplemented by existing coastal State jurisdiction , was the more acceptable solution for enforcement ;  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 7 of the report that , as compared with the situation two years ago , the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops has been met with a positive response by a number of insurers in the global market .  The Advisory Committee also notes that the willingness of insurers to offer coverage is based on the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations .  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
" Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

The Secretary-General had noted in his report that , because of the perceived reduction in risk level following the winding down of major peacekeeping operations in Cambodia , the former Yugoslavia , Somalia and Mozambique , a number of global insurers had responded positively to the possibility of developing a viable commercial insurance policy to cover accidental death and disability risks for peacekeeping troops .  
While it would now be possible to obtain commercial insurance coverage for contingent personnel assigned to United Nations peacekeeping operations if the Secretary-General were so authorized by the General Assembly , in view of the opinion provided by the Office of Legal Affairs , any compensation made for the death or disability of such military personnel could not be paid directly to disabled troops or dependent survivors , but rather to the national authorities , as was the current practice .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .

These projects include the compilation , review and implementation of measures to facilitate trade flows , to promote national transport activities , to increase awareness on efficient commercial practices in international trade , as well as to provide Customs administrations with proper working tools designed to increase efficiency and transparency in Customs clearance time and revenue collection and to generate timely and reliable trade data .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;

The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
As regards the prices charged by the project company , two basic approaches have been observed : in some cases the project company is free to determine its pricing and commercial policy , while in other cases the law subjects the initial price charged by the project company to some control mechanism ( e.g . approval by the competent regulatory body , or requirement that the prices be provided in the project agreement ) .  
An appropriate legal framework for the settlement of those disputes may be provided by means of special legislation , based on internationally accepted standards , governing international commercial arbitration and reflecting particular needs of international arbitration .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
Also to be considered is the expansion of United Nations efforts to achieve agreement on key issues required for a favourable environment for business , such as uniform commercial codes and intellectual property and accounting standards , and to deal with transnational problems , such as crime and corruption , which inhibit both good governance and good business .  
But would it be outrageous to say that it is not completely true either , because it is obvious that in Africa there exist countries whose development level is already allowing them to cherish some legitimate commercial and trade ambitions on the international market as well as countries that still require assistance , at least in certain areas , and particularly in the social area . 
Linked to the creation of economic and commercial activities adapted to the various areas concerned , microeconomic and microfinance projects supported by the Agency and often carried out with the assistance of local bodies like Environmental Development Action in the Third World ( ENDA ) have had beneficial , rapid and lasting results . 
In view of the special features of biological weapons and the complicated technical factors involved , efforts should be made to realistically formulate relevant definitions , criteria and lists ; clearly delineate activities prohibited and permitted under the Convention ; and , on this basis , explore effective and feasible verification measures , together with measures aimed at preventing abuse , protecting commercial secrets and reducing unnecessary interference in normal scientific research and industrial activities .  
When people talk of the increasing intangibility of the economy , they are speaking about developments in industrial production such as the rapid development of microprocessors for information-related products ; transactions such as communication over the Internet ; productive assets , such as software and research ; and commercial assets , such as patents , goodwill , corporate organization and skilled staff .  
Non-governmental organizations provide a wide variety of services to help orient and settle new arrivals , including temporary housing , interpretation , accompanying individuals to governmental agencies , guidance in seeking employment and permanent housing , orienting family members to public and commercial services such as schools and stores , etc .  
After a three-year assessment period , countries for which existing debt-reduction mechanisms are considered insufficient for achieving sustainability would receive debt reduction of up to 90 per cent on eligible debt by Paris Club creditors , comparable treatment by other bilateral and commercial creditors , and reduction of claims by multilateral creditors .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
The World Bank has estimated that electric power delivered to end-users equals only about 40 per cent of installed capacity in developing countries , compared to over 80 per cent of installed capacity in developed countries . 19 Establishing the principle of full ( or nearly full ) cost-recovery would permit much greater recourse to foreign financing as bond financing for either public or private national enterprises operating on fully commercial principles within an adequate regulatory environment . 
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
A prevalence of environmental inequities based on socio _ economic and racial factors has been reported : of the two factors , race appears to have both an independent and a more important relationship with the distribution of commercial hazardous waste facilities than income .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
The priorities pursued , which the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse , include a multidisciplinary approach , involving social services and mental health workers , to interviewing and investigation , special treatment in court settings which are child-friendly and appropriate to age and status , and continuing care in order to address the lingering effects of commercial sexual exploitation .  Measures are to be reinforced through education systems which provide children with skills and opportunities as a preventive strategy .  
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Space telecommunications , which are the primary field of commercial applications of space , involve major economic , political , cultural , strategic and industrial stakes .  
In response it was noted that the adjective " financial " had a narrow meaning in a number of legal systems , as related to transactions with currency , securities or stocks in the financial market .  Also the adjective " commercial " , which was used in some legal systems to refer to transactions covered by a particular body of law sometimes referred to as " commercial law " , might be interpreted as excluding certain categories of debtors whose transactions were not qualified as " commercial affairs " in those legal systems .  
The third stage , once the crisis is contained , is to stimulate recovery , by recreating accountable systems of governance , reviving commercial and economic activity , promoting social cohesion , rebuilding infrastructure , restoring health and education services and encouraging individual enterprises .  
The objective of structural adjustment programmes was to enable developing countries to have more normal commercial relations with other countries , since access to international capital and increased exports were essential for development and growth .  
It was said that it would be very important to direct such an effort towards the development of international norms and standards for commercial conduct in the field , with the intent of supporting trade through electronic media , and not have as a goal the establishment of a regulatory regime for service providers , or other rules which could create costs unacceptable for market applications of electronic data interchange ( EDI ) ( ibid . , para .  117 ) .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
[ 43 ] / The main conclusion reached in this study on income distribution at the international level is to signal the need to include cooperation agreements tied to commercial agreements on free trade and economic and commercial cooperation , whether at the international , regional or bilateral level . 
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
Our signature of the Convention and the subsequently active role we took in the joint endeavour to craft it into workable mechanisms reflect in general Israel 's vision of the world in which it wishes to exist and prosper _ in particular its continuing interest , which is shared by many other countries , to preserve the Convention 's core balance between a State 's duty to demonstrate compliance and its right to protect itself from intrusive and abusive encroachment on its security and its commercial and proprietary interests .  
A substantial part of the losses sustained by the Bulgarian economy resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and Western Europe , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
In close cooperation with the World Bank , the European Commission , the United States Treasury and the United States Agency for International Development , my office is focusing on getting the privatization process started , modernizing the framework for domestic and foreign investment , reforming the social security system as a prerequisite for easing the excessive burden of contributions , and approximating basic commercial laws to the standards of the European Union . 
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Subsequently , the importance of managing wildfire hazards became the dominant policy promoted through the collaborating interests of public authorities , commercial interests and local commitments driven by a combination of balanced economic , social and ecological values .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Invites the relevant international financial institutions to give appropriate consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
As concerns general operating expenses , the significant reduction is attributable in large part to several energy-saving measures undertaken , such as shutting down the internal air-conditioning fan supply after certain hours ; reduced communications requirements from favourable rates negotiated with and paid to commercial carriers ; and lower requirements for rental and maintenance of premises as a result of release of space , for new cleaning and other contracts and for rental and maintenance of furniture and equipment arising from such action as the move of the mainframe to the International Computing Centre in Geneva .  
New policy perspectives coordinating the commercial , consumer and strategic requirements on a national and international level needed to be established , and the dialogue between military , industry and civilian users needed to be extended .  
Expresses the conviction that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
While developing countries did not constitute a viable market for most of the large-scale satellite communication projects , they benefited from lucrative markets in the industrialized countries that lured international commercial programmes , and might be able to take advantage of the excess capacity of those programmes to satisfy their own communication needs .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
We believe that serious consideration must be given to the immediate cancellation of the bilateral , multilateral and commercial debts of the least developed countries , without imposing conditionalities that hurt the poor and vulnerable .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
The potential danger posed by the frequent passage of commercial vessels , and on occasion vessels carrying hazardous , toxic and radioactive wastes through the high seas surrounding a number of small island developing States , continues unattenuated .  
The social transition may be seen as the outcome of progress through the major transitions described so far : indicators of human development ( see table ) tend to rise with increasingly stable and healthy populations , rising per capita income , access to commercial energy and material goods , adequate nutrition and safe water and sanitation services . 2 At a global level , most indicators are improving significantly . 
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .  
It has been recognized that , during the reform programme leading to greater liberalization of trade in agriculture , least developed and net food-importing developing countries may experience negative effects in terms of the availability of adequate supplies of basic foodstuffs from external sources on reasonable terms and conditions , including short-term difficulties in financing normal levels of commercial imports of basic foodstuffs .  
These include not only technological progress , but also political , social and structural changes around the world and their impact on the liberalization of telecommunication services , the introduction of non-GSO satellite systems for commercial communications , growing market orientation , the change in the way this widening market is shared between private and public service providers and the general globalization and commercialization of communication systems .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order , inter alia , to promote economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment , that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance , economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries , and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
The net additional requirements of $ 536,400 for commercial communications were attributable to the satellite user charges from the previous mandate period ( $ 356,200 ) , recorded in the reporting period because of the late submission of invoices and the extensive use of satellite facilities by the military , civilian police and electoral observer components of the mission in November and December 1994 ( $ 626,000 ) . ( b ) Main trunking contract .  
The earlier than anticipated departure , effective 2 February 1996 , of the key military logistic support unit provided to UNAMIR required that the functions of that unit be provided through commercial contractors .  
While repatriation travel of staff officers was arranged on commercial aircraft and reflected under other travel costs budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , other military contingent personnel departed on the UNAMIR-chartered aircraft , with respective costs absorbed under the fixed-wing aircraft heading , resulting in savings of $ 826,600 .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
While the United Nations has long experience in implementing humanitarian programmes during periods of peace , conflict and post-conflict situations , it should be emphasized that the humanitarian programme pursuant to resolution 986 ( 1995 ) is unique and is being implemented within the context of a sanctions regime with all its attendant political and commercial dimensions .  
Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment , finance , technology , skills and other important resources across national borders , in order to promote growth and development , and recognizes in this context , that effective efforts at all levels to combat corruption and bribery are essential elements of an improved international business environment ;  
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
This was done for practical reasons , including a desire to allow the Ministry a high degree of flexibility in securing numerous and diverse offers from a variety of sources , at competitive prices and on the customary commercial terms , and in order to avoid being restricted to a single brand name under which all our requirements for a particular item might not be available within the period the Memorandum of Understanding is in effect .  
Revised standards for dry and dried fruit ; United Nations / ECE standard for bovine carcasses and commercial cuts ; revised standards for Early and Ware Potatoes ; promotional brochures for UN / EDIFACT ; trade facilitation and UN / EDIFACT training manual ;  
Four projects on formulation of technical assistance projects that can enhance economic cooperation among developing countries through the exchange of experiences and know-how and the sharing of methods of production , identification of technical assistance needs by integration groupings in the field and searches for practical and operational solutions , development of a cadre of trained negotiators in international commercial diplomacy and mobilization of funds for the financing of operational activities ; 
The latter provides an incentive to market-based forms of technology and skills transfer both for industrial / infrastructural projects and resource management / preservation ( e.g . enhancing the carbon sequestration service rendered by tropical forests , natural rubber plantations and other commercial tree crops ) in developing countries .  JI projects , in particular in technical infrastructure , may also improve the living conditions of the poor or other disadvantaged groups in developing countries .  
These conflicts have underlying causes which arise from a number of accumulated and complex political , commercial , socio-economic , ethnic , cultural and ideological factors .  
Thus , the strengthening of supply capabilities will have to be achieved much more through economy-wide approaches towards promoting savings and investment , research and technological development , a high level of educational attainment and professional training , the commercial banking sector , small - and medium-scale enterprises , regional development and the building of a modern physical infrastructure .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
As far as the Russian Federation directly is concerned , it is firmly guided by the principles of the sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and freedom of international trade and navigation mentioned in the resolution and supports , and intends to continue to develop normal commercial and economic ties with Cuba based on mutual interest and reciprocal advantage and put into practice in strict conformity with generally accepted international norms without any form of discrimination and on the basis of world prices .  
Other key problems for many SMEs are caused by inadequate management skills , especially those required to compete in the present-day globalized economy , lack of client orientation , limited access to relevant information , not being linked to commercial or productive networks and lack of knowledge and resources for incorporating innovation or quality improvement into production processes .  
One major initiative , of which UNDP was one of the main supporters , was the Micro-credit Summit held in Washington , D.C . , in February 1997 , which brought together 2,500 participants from more than 100 countries , including beneficiaries of micro-finance programmes , organizers of micro-credit projects , commercial and development banks , non-governmental organizations , multilateral and bilateral donors , as well as heads of Government and senior officials who were heads of small business promotional institutions . 
Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .  
The Special Rapporteur was also informed of the existence of commercial sexual exploitation of children , through loosely organized networks , in rich , private houses known as Mbwa kali , which refers to the Beware of fierce dog signs posted outside the gates .  
Still other cooperative mechanisms , such as the WMO World Weather Watch programme , support the coordination of global scientific activity for prompt and accurate weather information and other services for public , private and commercial use .  
That meeting intended to forge firm partnerships on five key issues : global economic commerce ; biotrade , for the benefit of indigenous and local communities ; commercial diplomacy ; risk management of commodities , and microcredit .  
The potential use of diamond and DLC films in electronic circuits , where their high thermal conductivity and electrical insulation make them unique , as well as in cutting and grinding tool surfaces has led to increased commercial interest and activity .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
The major cost required for the rental of transmission and distribution facilities ( $ 5,948,000 per biennium ) is a recurring cost calculated at commercial prices and as such is not sustainable within existing resources .  
Despite economic hardships exacerbated by the illegal economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America , Cubas Government continued to devote a significant and growing proportion of its budget to social protection programmes .  
My Governments pattern of payments clearly reflects its unshakable determination to meet its budgetary obligations despite the extraordinary difficulties it is facing as a result of the rigid , irrational and inhuman economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on Cuba for more than three long decades .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
Expresses its deep concern at the lack of progress in investigating the downing of the two aircraft chartered by the United Nations and the loss under suspicious circumstances of other commercial aircraft over UNITA controlled areas , and reiterates its call upon all concerned , especially UNITA , to cooperate fully with and to facilitate an immediate and objective international investigation of these incidents ;

At international level , our country is due to sign the Patent Cooperation Treaty , although alternative measures do exist to avoid the abuse of patents as well as monopolistic and anti _ competitive commercial practices on the part of patent inventors .  
While other agencies had long faced problems in choosing legitimate or representative partners in the private sector , those partners were usually non-profit bodies , whereas working on operational projects with profit-seeking partners was clearly more problematic ; association with the United Nations could be interpreted as giving an unfair commercial advantage over its competitors , national and international . 
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
The main objective of this measure is to maintain a modern legal framework which responds to the current economic and social situation by helping to consolidate our economic and commercial liberalization process , and thus facilitating investment and trade ;  
Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
The global seed trade is dominated by large private industry giants whose vast economic power and commercial control over plant germplasm is beginning to overshadow the role of the public sector in plant breeding and other agricultural research in many countries .  
Trade facilitation with the following objectives : ( I ) to develop and promote simple , transparent and effective processes for global commerce ; ( ii ) to manage the development and maintenance of the international standard , EDIFACT ( Electronic Data Interchange for Administration , Commerce and Transport ) ; and ( iii ) to develop , maintain and promote internationally accepted and harmonized standards and recommendations for the commercial quality of perishable produce ; 
Child pornography means the conception , production , presentation , dissemination , whether or not on commercial basis , visual or audio , that constitute a real or simulated representation of a child engaged or depicted as engaged in sexual activity or any representation of the body or part of the body of a child for promoting or satisfying sexual purposes .  
Encouraging States Parties also to take all reasonable steps to put in place effective bilateral , multilateral or regional arrangements for cooperation in the prevention , detection , prosecution and punishment of acts of tourism organized with the purpose of facilitating the effecting of a commercial sexual relationship with a child ,  
In addition , it was observed that the result would rather be that the draft Convention validated such assignments , as a matter of civil or commercial law , while leaving to other law specific challenges to their validity ( e.g . , the invalidation of an assignment made within the suspect period before the opening of an insolvency proceeding as a fraudulent or preferential transfer ) . 
In other national laws a link is required between the property to be attached and the claim in that , for example , immunity can not be pleaded in respect of funds allocated for economic or commercial activity governed by private law upon which the claim is based or that immunity can not be pleaded with respect to assets set aside by the State to pursue its commercial activities .  
In order for space exploration and development to benefit all United Nations Member States more effectively , greater international cooperation will be needed , not only on specific projects such as environmental monitoring and protection , but also in ensuring that international regulatory structures encourage commercial space activities in ways that are predictable , transparent and effective .  
This does not fit in with the traditional concept of the commercial money market or purchasing flexibility , and constitutes a senseless waste of Iraqi funds , for reasons linked to the mechanism used by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) for processing memorandum of understanding contracts .

The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
That the United States of America continues to ignore the will of the international community , as embodied in the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly with a view to lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba , is to be regarded as a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations .  
On the basis of the foregoing , the Sudan opposes the economic and commercial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , which has caused great damage to the Cuban people and violated its legitimate rights and interests , being a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations and showing disregard for their lofty and noble principles .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .

Mr . Mra ( Myanmar ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegations appreciation for the Secretary-Generals report contained in document A 54-259 , dated 18 August 1999 , on agenda item 33 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
In keeping with these positions and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and universally recognized principles of international law , Mali will this year again associate itself with the Member States calling for the lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of America .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban in September 1998 ; Malaysia strongly supported the final document of that summit , wherein the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries reiterated their call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial actions against Cuba .  
In this light , it is pertinent to note that the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement during the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly , held in New York on 23 September 1999 , once again called on the parties concerned to strictly comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions and emphasized the need to terminate the economic , commercial and financial sanctions against Cuba .  
We reaffirm our intention to continue to develop normal commercial and economic relations with Cuba , based on common interest and mutual benefit and implemented in strict accordance with our obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and generally recognized principles and norms of international law , without any discrimination or jeopardy to the legal rights and interests of the parties .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .  
International cooperation should be conducted in the modes that are considered most effective and appropriate by the countries concerned , including , inter alia , governmental and non-governmental ; commercial and non-commercial ; global , multilateral , regional or bilateral ; and international cooperation among countries in all levels of development .  
Acknowledging that special attention must be given to the mental health needs of women , including those who are marginalized because of , inter alia , race , ethnicity , religion , age , social and economic status , physical and or mental disability , exploitative commercial sex , displacement , migration and human immunodeficiency virus acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( HIV AIDS ) ,  
Among the cleaner transportation fuels , within a near-term horizon , natural gas appears to be the most likely and cost-effective significant alternative to motor gasoline and diesel , particularly for use in fleets , given its abundant resources , its possibilities as a high performance fuel , its clean burning qualities and its convenient commercial availability to end users , especially in the major transportation consumer nations .  
Reaffirms its resolve to establish the truth about the circumstances of and to determine the responsibility for the downing of the two aircraft chartered by the United Nations and the loss under suspicious circumstances of other commercial aircraft over UNITA controlled territory through an immediate and objective international investigation of these tragic incidents , and reiterates its call upon all concerned , especially UNITA , to cooperate fully with and to facilitate such an investigation ;

The Special Rapporteur attended the seventh session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on 22 and 23 April 1998 and made a statement on 22 April 1998 , in which he said that crime prevention and bribery in international commercial transactions required the cooperation not only of the international community but the political will of Governments to organize their domestic systems of justice to meet the challenges . 
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
Welcomes the implementation since 1994 by the Paris Club of the Naples terms , as well as the decision to go beyond the Naples terms to provide debt reduction for eligible countries , in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries , and invites all other bilateral , multilateral and commercial creditors to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability ;  
It is also one of the most effective tools to combat intolerance by opening the gateway to messages of mutual respect , enabling them to circulate freely worldwide , and by encouraging collective actions to oppose and bring to an end such phenomena as hate speech , racism and the sexual and commercial exploitation of , in particular , women and children .  
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
Also noteworthy was another triangular initiative in support of Cuba ' s economic recovery , under which expertise was transferred from Brazil , Chile and Mexico , with triangular support provided by Norway , in macroeconomic policy formulation , national budgeting , central banking accounting , treasury functions , commercial banking and external debt management .  
The suggestion of the Commissions Working Group on the topic to delete any reference to the nature or purpose of State activities in determining whether the activities should be considered commercial transactions , and thus subject to the internal jurisdiction of another State , touched upon one of the most controversial points in the entire draft .  
In cases where public ownership and control is desired , direct private financing as well as infrastructure operation under commercial principles may be achieved by establishing a separate legal entity controlled by the Government to own and operate the project .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
It is advisable that statutory criteria for determining tariffs and fees take into account , in addition to social factors the Government regards as relevant , the concessionaires interest in achieving a level of cash flow that ensures the economic viability and commercial profitability of the project .  
While rules of private international law often allow considerable freedom to choose the law governing commercial contracts , that freedom is in some countries restricted for contracts and legal relationships that are not qualified as commercial , such as , for instance , certain contracts entered into by public authorities of the host country ( for example , guarantees and assurances by the Government , power purchase or fuel supply commitments by a public authority ) or contracts with consumers .  
It is instructive to conclude from it that the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is a unilateral action , whose extraterritorial effects have no validity in public international law .  
Determining actual and reasonable costs is often difficult for troop contributors to do , especially when they move matriel and personnel by military means and can not therefore easily provide documentary evidence of an acceptable national commercial rate .  
However , it was agreed that strong international support measures , including financial , technical and commercial assistance , are of critical importance in influencing the future growth and development of LDCs .  
Although confidencebuilding measures whether they be military , political , economic , commercial , cultural or humanitarian are no substitute for concrete disarmament measures , they can play an important role in progress towards disarmament .  
These measures have serious adverse impact on the overall economic , commercial , political , social and cultural life of the targeted countries , and intensify their challenges in this era of globalization and its concomitant traumatic transformations .  
In this regard , it recommended that creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions be encouraged to consider continuing the initiative and efforts to address commercial debt of heavily indebted African countries .  
Regarding commercial debt of LDCs , orderly and equitable workout procedures should be established , with explicit responsibilities of creditors and debtors and clearly defined roles for the public and private sectors .  
No less than some thirty conventions , multilateral agreements , uniform model laws or standard rules relating to international commercial dealings or international carriage are involved .  
From the viewpoint of international commercial operators , the question is considered in its traditional private law aspect : evidential rules are of key importance in contractual matters and in the settlement of disputes between commercial parties .  
The view was expressed that a single issue / item for discussion should be included in the agenda of the forty-first session of Legal Subcommittee on international cooperation in limiting obtrusive commercial space advertising that could interfere with astronomical observations , as had been proposed by the delegation of the United States .  
In support of this affirmation , I should merely like to draw attention to the meeting to be held tomorrow , in a room adjoining this one , where the Economic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions will come together to design a new worldwide financial architecture which will be based on the social issues which were stressed by our heads of State at the Millennium Summit , and not merely on economic and commercial profit .  
Acknowledging the host countrys position that it was not in a position to interfere with personal and commercial transactions in the free market , he expressed the view that the foregoing must be considered in the light of the host countrys obligations vis - - vis the permanent missions and their staff , including their housing .  
To protect the international civil service from any appearance of impropriety , international civil servants must not accept , without authorization from the executive head , any honour , decoration , gift , remuneration , favour or economic benefit of more than nominal value from any source external to their organizations ; it is understood that this includes Governments as well as commercial firms and other entities .  
The Committee learned that greater utilization of the two conference centres continued to be constrained by uncertainty about the appropriate use of the facilities , particularly as venues for private sector and commercial events ; limited opportunities for rerouting meetings from the calendar of conferences ; inadequate staffing structures for management of the centres ; lack of funds for marketing and promotional activities ; and regional instability .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
The development of a comprehensive convention on international space law with due regard for the sovereign rights of States could help to resolve such difficult issues as the delimitation and definition of outer space , control of space pollution , management of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , registration of space objects , protection of intellectual property , responsibility and the settlement of disputes .  
Member States should be invited to consider adopting at the national level such measures , including legislation , that would ( a ) discourage all actions and activities , commercial or otherwise , that could be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to self-determination and independence by the peoples of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories ; and ( b ) promote full respect for the human rights of peoples living under foreign domination and facilitate their recourse to judicial proceedings in order to gain economic and social restitution .  
Representatives of national space agencies , foreign and defence ministries , academies of science , leading outer-space-related scientific and research centres , commercial and industrial companies , international and non-governmental outer space organizations , universities , scientific and education centres , insurance companies and banks engaged in outer-space-related activities , and also cosmonauts and astronauts have been invited to attend the forum .  
Given that the forthcoming conference is being timed to coincide with the anniversary of Yury Gagarins flight , considerable attention will be paid to the issues of the peaceful use of outer space and international - including commercial - cooperation in its exploration as a real alternative to the militarization of outer space .  
In view of the unstable security situation in the country and in order to avoid potential security gaps related to the continuing repatriation of ECOMOG troops , significant resources were utilized for the transportation by air of contingent-owned equipment , stores and supplies , as well as for the strengthening of UNAMSIL air operations capability by enhancing its helicopter fleet with armed military helicopters and commercial heavy-lift rotary aircraft .  
The view was expressed that the initiative held considerable potential for facilitating the development of commercial activities in outer space , to the benefit of countries and in all economic spheres .  
In order not to stifle those potential economic benefits , that delegation stressed the need to ensure that the final texts of those instruments satisfied the requirements of financial markets to overcome existing commercial risks associated with financing of space projects .  
That delegation also raised concerns regarding the possible transfer of access codes and control of space objects to creditors in cases of default , in particular in cases where the facilities of a single satellite were being shared by multiple users , including States , or where satellites served governmental and public service functions in addition to those of a purely commercial nature .  
The view was expressed that the proposal by the delegation of the United States regarding international cooperation in limiting obtrusive commercial space advertising concerned a matter of relatively little importance when considered alongside many of the other potential issues for consideration by the Legal Subcommittee .  
As stressed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations at the opening meeting of the second session of the Committee , if the agreed objectives are to be attained , a large-scale , concerted effort must be made by the many different actors involved , including both rich and poor , the public and the private sectors , civil society , international institutions , and commercial and voluntary entities .  
The training and technical assistance programme carried out by the Secretariat under the mandate given by the Commission , in particular in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , encompasses two main lines of activity : ( a ) information activities aimed at promoting understanding of international commercial law conventions , model laws and other legal texts ; and ( b ) assistance to Member States with commercial law reform and adoption of UNCITRAL texts .  
No matter how valuable a particular item of property may be to a commercial enterprise , it will have little or no value to a creditor as collateral for a loan unless the creditor is able to obtain a security right in the property that has priority over other creditors and remains effective in insolvency proceedings and that is capable of being enforced by the creditor in a predictable and timely fashion .

Urge States to foster the creation , growth and expansion of minority-owned businesses by increasing access to capital through , inter alia , community development banks , work with the private sector to create jobs , help retain existing jobs and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas ;  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
FAO also assists in the development of institutions for the management of common pool natural resources oriented towards reconciling conflicting interests in watersheds between upstream and downstream water users or in fish-producing areas between artisanal and commercial fishermen . 
The world has witnessed significant changes during this period of time that have both direct and indirect implications for the Trainmar Programme : economic liberalization and privatization in many countries ; establishment of regional economic and political blocs ; globalization of economic activity ; consolidation of large companies into even bigger companies with extended control of the international supply chains ; technological and operational innovation in the maritime clusters ; advent of information and communication technologies that facilitate and necessitate new commercial organization .  
The qualifications would specifically need to embrace : general management ( setting targets and milestones , planning strategic measures by which to achieve targets , estimating costs and design budgets , finance , implementation and control ) ; pedagogics ( theoretical formation as well as skills in the design and delivery of courses , adequate knowledge of educational and training policies and regimes ) ; substantive experience and knowledge ( trade and commerce , business and global logistics , technologies , operation , organization , economics and commercial processes of maritime transport ) .  
Since industrial environments such as shipping and ports undergo continuous technological , organizational and commercial change in a world which is changing continuously in respect of social and political structures , the evaluation and validation of courses - as well as the updating of instructors - must also be continuous .  Otherwise , an admirable system may end up teaching the wrong things !  
Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
The harm done to the Cuban people has been established before competent judicial authorities and abundantly documented in the reports submitted to the General Assembly each year by the Secretary-General under the item Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
To promote and defend human rights it is essential , in this regard , to promote equitable trade among nations , to establish a minimum of control in commercial exchanges , to reorient globalization and focus more on the human being rather than on profit , to strengthen regional integration processes as a shield against the disastrous effects of globalization and to break the vicious circle of indebtedness of developing countries .  
A renewed commercial interest in biodiversity and indigenous plants and materials has created opportunities for rural women to utilize their traditional knowledge and experience and to take advantage of emerging national and global markets .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
At the national level , three distinct but complementary institutional structures are emerging to reflect the expanding role of the private sector as the main provider of transport and related commercial services .  
First , as the public sector retreats from commercial services , allowing the private sector to take the leading role , the public sector is assuming the role of regulator to ensure fair competition among service providers , protecting the consumer against monopoly abuse and enforcing quality and safety standards to protect the consumer .  
In preparing and adopting model legislative provisions on international commercial conciliation , the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law ( UNCITRAL or the Commission ) was mindful that such provisions would be a more effective tool for States modernizing their legislation if accompanied by background and explanatory information .  
In the current conducive environment , such measures contravene all laws , principles and norms governing international relations in the field of global trade and directed towards the enhancement of extensive commercial and economic interactions among countries .  
Bridges should be built in the political , economic , financial , commercial , technical and social realm , and institutions should be strengthened at all levels , to facilitate such integration in a just and equitable process .  
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
The problems created by globalization could provoke a genuine crisis of confidence among the worlds people as they saw poverty worsening , income unequally distributed within and among countries and international financial and commercial markets prey to instability at a time when the international community had never had such economic and technological means at its disposal .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to submit , when practicable , for the consideration of the General Assembly , a comprehensive report on : the outcome of the schematic design ; options for deciding on the final scale of the project ; projected revenues and the cost of operating and maintaining the new visitors experience ; proposals for expanded commercial activities ; options for operating methodologies ; means of adjusting to changing situations ; procedures for the operation of the proposed capital improvement fund ; and a time-line for implementation . 
A range of interests needs to be accommodated by that legal mechanismthe debtor , the owners and management of the debtor , the creditors who may be secured to varying degrees , employees , fiscal creditors , guarantors of debt and unsecured creditors , as well as government , commercial and social institutions and practices that are relevant to the design of the mechanism and to the institutional framework required for its operation .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
His delegation welcomed the efforts of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) with regard to a draft convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property ; given the growth in commercial use of outer space and the increasing role played by the private sector , further work was necessary to develop legal instruments and regulations to deal with matters such as financing , mortgages and guarantees . 
The system supported domestic applications in areas such as crop forecasting , ground and surface water harvesting , forest surveying , wasteland and potential fishing-zone mapping , urban planning and environmental monitoring ; and the data from those satellites was being shared with several countries under commercial agreements .  
Within the framework of a comprehensive convention , complex issues such as the delimitation and definition of outer space , the monitoring of pollution by man-made debris , the regulation of scientific research and commercial activities in outer space , the protection of intellectual property rights and the settlement of disputes could be resolved in a mutually acceptable manner .  
Experts mentioned the following as being among the specific difficulties faced by SMEs : demand volatility , and the consequent lack of transparency and predictability in the business environment ; large capital requirements ; weak linkages with international markets ; scarce information about commercial opportunities abroad ; and the difficulty in finding highly trained personnel .
