It was an exposition of great foresight made in consideration of the destiny of our country , national rejuvenation , the implementation of the strategy for rejuvenating the nation by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , and the development of socialist modernization .  
This time , in a seemingly serious manner , Cohen once again spread the word : " The Gulf area is confronted with the threat of ceaseless proliferation of massive antipersonnel biochemical weapons . "  The spearhead was directed at Iraq and Iran as though the Gulf countries ' urgent task were " to cope with biochemical-weapon attacks launched by Iraq and Iran , " and it would be too late if they did not buy American arms right now !  
Jiang Zemin stressed that , as two ancient civilizations of the East and West , cultural exchanges between China and Greece are very lively .  Last year the Greek national theater put on the Greek tragedy " Medea " in Beijing , and the same play has been done on the stages of both countries in the form of a Chinese local opera from Hebei directed by Chinese , which was warmly received by the audiences .  
Given the characteristics of modern wars , particularly the several limited wars over the past several years , warring parties without exception directed their primary attacks and their surgical strike targets at the enemies ' command centers .

On 29 June , Wang Han-ning , " deputy chief of staff and concurrently executive officer " , further pointed out at a news conference : The " Han Kuang-16 exercise " scheduled for mid-August is an annual training program which is directed at a possible enemy " attack on Taiwan " ; it is divided into three main parts : deduction from chessmen maneuvers ; simulated chessmen at and above battalion level in the combat theater , together with drills by a number of actual troops ;  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .

They have resolutely supported the Chinese Government 's solemn and just stance and directed their fervent patriotism into training and execution of duties .  
However , it is noteworthy that Taiwan political figures one after another have jumped forward to apply pressure to the Japanese side and asked for a visa for Lee Teng-hui .  This has fully exposed Lee Teng-hui 's complete ulterior motives in eagerly seeking to travel to Japan for " medical treatment . "  In fact , this is a political plot meticulously planned and directed by the " Taiwan independence " forces , with Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian as their representatives .  
During his 12 years in power , Lee Teng-hui played political trickery to the utmost , excluded those not agreeing with him , was tyrannical and domineering , and , mechanically copying the Western parliamentary democracy model , directed several " constitutional amendments " and elections , prompting Taiwan to become a place " filled with a sense of confrontation and hatred " and distorting all mechanisms of a modern democratic society .  
Under the conditions of socialism , reform is carried out in a peaceful and orderly form , it does not only resolve some minor problems , but is directed at the old economic structure as a whole .  Therefore it is arduous and complicated , and inevitably produces a strong impact that shocks society in may aspects .  
The officers and men of the rescue regiment began by studying actual international submarine rescue efforts in recent years , mobilized officers and men , organs , and key divers to conduct in-depth research at submarine forces to familiarize themselves with submarine structures and features , envisage various possible submarine accidents , formulate draft rescue plans directed at different situations and different sea areas , and conduct repeat training from the port to the sea and from above to below the water so as to continuously raise the troops ' rapid response capability in dealing with submarine accidents .  
They directed such popular feelings by means of populism and a so-called new Taiwan population doctrine .  Of course , they also called for " redressing the injustice and promoting justice , " and tried to turn people 's discontent and resentments accumulated in the past into a form of reinstatement .  However , we found that such democracy became more and more imperious , biased , fanatic , and extremist .

To propagate the " Falungong " cult , the two accused used the reason of correcting the so-called state 's " wrong definition " of " Falungong . " Through prior planning , they raised funds and illegally published and duplicated more than 75,000 copies of materials that publicized the " Falungong " cult and attacked state policies and laws .  They further directed other " Falungong " members to distribute some 50,000 copies in Zibo localities , causing adverse social influence and undermining the normal enforcement of state laws .  
They acted in cahoots with some organizations opposing the central government and harassing Hong Kong , worked in concert with the inland " Falungong " cult organization , and cooperated closely with foreign anti-China forces to do whatever they pleased by exploiting Hong Kong 's special political environment .  They directed the spearhead of their attack at the central government and the Special Administrative Region government , causing great worries and restlessness among the great majority of Hong Kong residents .  
This was the case especially during the " 96-2 " exercise , which was staged under clear-cut stress involving units from different services and arms .

In this way , we can create an atmosphere facilitating safety education .

Meanwhile ordinary farmers working smaller , weaker family farms will receive government aid , but this will be completely divorced from their production .

It is worthy of note that in recent years , German sinology has gradually turned away from " pure academic sinology " - research directed entirely at studying traditional China-and has incorporated such topics as modern politics , history , sociology , commerce , culture and education to examine practical issues in China .
