Starting from the reform and institutional building , we have put into practice the systems of operating land auction , " two lines of revenue and expenditure , " government procurement , and so on , opened tangible construction markets and property rights trading markets , vigorously carried out the measure of making the administrative affairs , the village affairs , the enterprise affairs , and the social public affairs known to the public and , through the amplification of the legal system , took great pains to check the breeding of corrupt phenomena from their sources .  
The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
It has accurately epitomized and given a high appraisal to the following three major changes in history .  Namely , the productive forces have been greatly intensified , and the people have generally attained a moderately high standard of living .  Also , three major changes have taken place in social and economic activities in market supply and demand , in institutional environment in economic development , and in economic relations with foreign countries .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must persevere in orienting ourselves to the market without wavering at all and ceaselessly eliminate the institutional impediments to the development of productive forces and improve the socialist market economy so as to provide a mighty driving force and institutional guarantee for national economic and social development .  
In order to provide market access opportunities for the undertaking of developing institutional investors on an usual scale and on the basis of strict self-discipline , the China Securities Regulatory Commission will adopt a series of measures including introduction of open-end fund , making preparations for and give approval to establishment of new fund companies , paying attention to relevant preparation work in terms of establishment of fund management companies of Chinese-foreign joint ventures , and conducting studies on proposals of innovation of various funding products which have been transformed from closed-end to open-end .  
We should do so by starting with leaders in various financial institutions .  We should uphold healthy trends , develop new practices , enhance institutional initiative and creativity , and carry out to the letter , the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council . We should make fresh , and greater contributions , through pushing forward a financial reform , rectifying financial order , stepping up financial supervision and control , and heightening operational efficiency , and should guard against and alleviate financial risks , and support national economic development as well .  
In March this year , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to rename the State Administration for Industry and Commerce as State General Administration for Industry and Commerce , upgrading it from the vice ministerial level to the ministerial level .  The purpose was to further strengthen its authority and status as a market regulation and law enforcement department , so that the government 's institutional setup could better meet the requirements of the socialist market economic system .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : Philosophy and social science workers must engage in theoretical studies in light of actual situations .  They should pay attention to studying those important issues that have a close bearing on the situation as a whole , issues that will appear in the future , and strategic issues so that theoretical , institutional , and scientific-technological innovations will proceed vigorously .  
Li Lanqing stressed : All enterprises must , on the one hand , have their eyes on the outside world , keeping abreast of the development trend of the advanced enterprises at home and abroad , and on the other hands , have their eyes on our own country , finding out the gaps , getting to know our deficiencies , and expediting institutional innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and management innovation around the enhancement of enterprises ' quality and competitiveness .  
In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
Meanwhile , the consumption structure of cars in China has gradually changed from mainly institutional purchase to mainly individual purchase to meet various demands .  The increasing rise in the ratio of individual purchase of cars has determined the pattern of China 's car market .  That is , economic cars and medium-class cars should be the leading car models in the market .

Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
He added that apart from the gradual improvement in material conditions , a good academic research environment should include an institutional environment for scientific research , a humanistic environment , a good atmosphere for academic discussion , and harmonious interpersonal relationships .  
As for the so-called administrative monopolies , precisely as analyzed by the scholars of the State Council 's Development Research Center , with the vigorous support by a series of preferential policies by the state and nurtured by enormous investments over a long period of time , China 's rail transport , communications , electric power , coal and gas , running water , and numerous other infrastructure industries grew rapidly , and furthermore they were mainly enterprises invested in by the central or local governments which were operated as institutional monopolies .  
Carrying out comprehensive institutional reform is a strategic task set by the 15th CPC Congress , is urgently required by the establishment of a socialist market economic system , and is an important part of political system reform .  
Our country is vast in territory , with uneven economic and social development across the localities and great regional differences in the level of market maturity and resource endowments .  All this has determined that in carrying out institutional reform in the localities , it is necessary to proceed on the basis of reality and to accommodate local conditions in accordance with the center 's requirements .  
In short , the work of institutional reform is proceeding in an orderly manner in various areas .  The focus of the next step of reform is to vigorously proceed with the institutional reform of the cities , counties , and townships , changing functions , optimizing personnel structures , reducing fiscal and peasant burdens , and improving work efficiency and service quality .  It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and study and to get well prepared for work in all areas .  
It is reported that Lee Yuan-tseh has lately been pondering deeply over cross-strait topics .  He understands that it will not be easy to synthesize differing views into a concrete conclusion , given the resistance from the major political parties and the wide political spectrum from which the task force 's members come .  However , he is still hopeful that the cross-party task force will present a set of recommendations that will get the two organizations across the Taiwan Strait to resume negotiations within the institutional framework .  
It is understood that in the current institutional reform , the State Economic and Trade Commission will adhere to the principles of further changing government functions , adjusting and reducing specialized economic departments , reducing government administrative interference in enterprises , streamlining administration , and improving efficiency .  
Wei Jianxing required that party committees at all levels effectively strengthen their leadership over procuratorial work , show a clear-cut attitude for supporting the procuratorial organs in performing their functions , greatly support the activities of being good among the grass-roots procuratorates , help them solve existing problems and difficulties , comprehensively strengthen basic construction at the grass-roots level , greatly promote the personnel and institutional reforms in procuratorial organs , optimize the structure of the procurator contingent , continuously enhance the overall quality of the procurator contingent .  
In order to boost economic development and restructuring , it is necessary to rely on institutional innovations and scientific and technological innovations .  The continuous improvement of the people 's material and cultural life is the ultimate goal of economic development .  
At present , we should conscientiously study the knowledge relating to the socialist market economy , transform our concepts on financial and economic work , quicken the pace of building the public finance suited to China 's national conditions , further adjust and optimize the financial revenue-expenditure structure , incrementally reduce investment in the profit-making and operational spheres , vigorously cut down the administrative and institutional spending , push the operational institutions into the market , and concentrate the use of financial resources mainly on the areas of social and public necessities and social security .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
Township and town enterprises should give prominence to the main theme of development , make effort to create a good public opinion , policy , and legal system environment , grasp the three key points of institutional innovation , structural adjustment , and technological progress , and effectively enhance their overall quality and efficiency .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
The transformation of government functions should be made properly so that the administrative organs concerned may effectively perform their administrative functions in law enforcement .  In the course of institutional reforms , it is necessary to reinforce the contingent of pharmaceutical supervision and management personnel , adjust the structure of the contingent , focus attention on enhancing the quality of the pharmaceutical supervision and law enforcement personnel , and build an open , fair , honest , authoritative , highly efficient , and incorrupt contingent of pharmaceutical supervisors and law enforcers .  
Responsible comrades of the organizational , institutional structuring , financial , and pharmaceutical supervision and management departments of the party committees and people 's governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities and responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the people 's governments of the cities with independent budgetary status and cities at the deputy provincial level , the Xinjiang Production Corps , and other relevant central and State Council departments attended the meeting .  
This round of institutional reform and reorganization in the State Economic and Trade Commission and its subordinate state bureaus is another major step for forming a streamlined , unified , and highly efficient administrative structure .  This step is of great significance for achieving the goal of completely separating government institutions from enterprise management , transforming government functions , establishing and improving the socialist market economic system , enhancing the work efficiency of the government institutions , and enhancing macroeconomic control .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .  
During the 10th Five-Year Plan period , Guangdong must continue to act on Comrade Jiang Zemin 's instructions , namely " creating new strengths and reaching a higher level . "  First of all , Guangdong must give play to its political , institutional , and geographical advantages and speed up changing the government functions and improving the market economic order so as to become the forerunner in establishing and improving the socialist market economic system .  
Deputy Li Rixu said : To deepen reforms in state-owned enterprises and really turn them into the main entities in the market competition , it is necessary to actively explore an effective form of managing the state-owned assets , deepen the three institutional reforms inside the enterprises , establish effective incentive and self-control mechanisms ; it is also necessary to more quickly advance various supportive reforms , thus creating a benign external environment for state-owned enterprises ' reform and development .  The work of separating the government from enterprises should be further advanced .  
CPPCC committee member Li Guozhang said : The forming of a benign investment environment in the western part of the country is subject to restraints in six aspects , namely , the institutional restraints , the policy restraints , the restraints from the backward conditions of science , technology , and education , the restraints from the slow advance of the economic restructuring , the restraints from the out-of-date ideas , and the restraints from the transformation of the government functions .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;  
In the course of deliberation , the deputies held that in the past year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate could actively advance institutional reforms and innovations in the judicial system , and played an important role in protecting the legitimate interests of the broad masses , safeguarding social stability , and guaranteeing the smooth development of economic construction .  
At the same time , we will rely on our own efforts , work hard and perseveringly , combine our own efforts with the solicitude of the central authorities and the support of people across the country ; we will emancipate our minds , adopt new ideas , and accelerate economic and social development in Tibet through ideological , scientific , technological , and institutional innovations .

Third , Hong Kong 's financial market has been very active in developing securities derivative products relating to mainland enterprises .  It has been able to provide a wide variety of financial products and make red chips and H-shares more attractive to institutional investors , thereby deepening the market for red chips and H-shares .  
The public sector , particularly the Government , must be prepared to make bold institutional changes to secure greater efficiency and improved services , even if that means upsetting long established practices .  
The overall business environment of an economy is constituted from a host of structural and institutional factors which in general tend to change only gradually .  It is therefore not easy to understand the sudden drop in ranking between the past and the coming five years , nor the wide fluctuations in future ranking between different rounds .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
He also pointed out four challenges that the new millennium would bring to the financial market : the advance of information technology and the proliferation of internet applications ; the growing importance of institutional investors that caused fundamental changes to many aspects of the capital market ; the growing demand for cross-border financial transactions that has raised challenges for market regulators everywhere ; the emergence of a globalised market place that are linked by ever-expanding telecommunications technology which led to ever-growing cross-border financing activities .  
Internally , the Government will maintain the bedrock of its economic and trade policies , viz low taxes , free trade , free flow of information and the rule of law .  Building on such fundamental principles , we will keep upgrading our hardware ( infrastructure ) and software ( human resources and institutional framework ) in the continuous strive to sharpen our competitive edge and make perfect our business environment .  
Because the severely disabled and the elderly infirm were considered to have extra needs , the original objectives of the scheme were to give some financial help to the families concerned and to reduce demand for institutional care for these two groups .  
He emphasised that , in achieving the elusive twin goals of financial and monetary stability , mutually reinforcing anchors as well as an enhanced appreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas would be required , regardless of the formal institutional division of responsibility .  
The challenges are tough , but we have great strengths : a sound and solid institutional framework , sophisticated and world class infrastructure underpinning our position as an international financial , trading , shipping , logistics and tourism centre , and a large pool of talents experienced in doing business in overseas markets and conversant with the Mainland developments . 
* second , our institutional strengths .  These include " One Country , Two Systems " , the rule of law , a level playing field , clean government , the free flow of information , a simple and low tax regime , and an efficient and effective market-regulatory system .

Let me emphasise the institutional strengths that Hong Kong enjoys .  These include " One Country , Two Systems " , the rule of law , a level playing field , clean government , the free flow of information , a simple and low tax regime , and efficient and effective market-regulatory systems .  
In the coming years , our elderly services will aim at providing better support to elders in need and co-ordinating community and institutional care services .  For example , public rental estates with a high concentration of older people will be provided with integrated care services .  We will also organise more intergenerational activities in communities to help our elders enjoy healthy and active ageing .  
But we should never underestimate our strengths .  Our confidence stems from our distinct geographic advantage as well as the institutional assets we have developed over the years , including the rule of law , a free and open economy , a level playing field , an uncorrupt and efficient government and our enterprising people .  
The Government will strive to provide an institutional environment that is conducive to market development , in particular , to reinforce Hong Kong 's institutional strengths , such as the rule of law , a level playing field , clean government , free flow of information , a simple and low tax regime , and an efficient and effective market-regulatory system .  
Mr Leung said that Hong Kong must maintain its institutional strengths , the unique advantage it has over its neighbouring cities .  These strengths are the rule of law , a level playing field , the free flow of information , a low and simple tax regime , and a clean and efficient government .

Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
Some donors stressed that the comparative advantage of UNDP lay in institutional capacity-building at the national level while others emphasized the role of UNDP in decentralization and capacity-building at the provincial level .  
To be efficient , public expenditure planning needs a coherent macroeconomic framework in which the institutional capability is shared between the ministries of finance and planning , the central bank and the statistical office .  
In this respect , the appropriate legal and institutional machinery has been established , with a view to promoting a political system based on consensus and the rule of the majority and on a transparent and effective public administration .  
To meet this ambitious agenda , in addition to national efforts in economic , social and institutional development , Central American Governments have continued to emphasize the strategic importance of greater regional cooperation and integration .  
They stressed the need for a multisectoral approach and for diagnostic assessment of the current institutional arrangements and human resources capacity at the national level as a basis for formulating strategies for the future .  
At the international level , a comprehensive and open dialogue and a record of experience between multilateral and bilateral organizations and representatives of civil society should be an integral part of the institutional arrangements .

Assistance to human resources development totalled US $ 56 million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) has been impeded by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , mainly at the local level , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
Accordingly , an international criminal court that rested on firm legal and institutional bases and enjoyed wide acceptance could serve as an effective instrument for bringing the perpetrators of such crimes to justice .  
Thus , despite the deep-rooted and persistent social and institutional factors that have long affected the country , there is reason to hope that in the not-too-distant future this situation which to a certain extent is a remnant of the cold war will be rectified , leading to the achievement of the permanent peace which remains the most fervent hope of the people of Guatemala .  
In our domestic policy we have had two main priorities : to develop and consolidate the legal and institutional framework of a State of law and the smooth functioning of institutions appropriate to a modern democratic society on the one hand , and , on the other , to ensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market economy .  
African countries have committed themselves repeatedly to carry out far-reaching economic and institutional reforms , on the express understanding that their efforts would be fully complemented by the requisite material support of the international community , particularly the advanced countries .  
Comprising some 200-million ethnically and culturally diverse peoples , the ACS will serve as a vehicle to promote the implementation of policies and programmes designed to harness , utilize and develop the potential of the Caribbean Sea , promote and enhance economic space for trade and investment opportunities , and establish and augment , as appropriate , institutional structures and cooperative arrangements responsive to the various cultural identities within the region .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
Indeed , the widespread desire to bring uniformity to international society in political and institutional terms , on the one hand , and economic and social terms , on the other , has led to an imbalance every bit as dramatic as the imbalance not so long ago when the world was bipolar .  
The commitment of resources at both the national and international levels ought to be focused on the development of programmes that place priority on the development of human capacities , and removing institutional and infrastructural impediments in order to facilitate sustained economic growth and sustainable development . 
We hope that the final outcome of this high-level meeting will give a strong impetus to developing such partnerships among the principal actors in this field so that the World Programme of Action will have sound institutional and political support at all levels international , regional and national .  
To this end , an institutional infrastructure was developed to promote economic and social development for our peoples through the establishment of a new international economic order , one that would generate more favourable conditions and opportunities for the developing countries to make progress , thus setting in motion a process of evening out the major imbalances between North and South .

We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
All of us here are aware that threats to international peace and security arise from the deterioration of the social , economic and institutional fabric of States , and that their worst effects , such as internal armed conflicts , drug trafficking , corruption and the inevitable sequel of those ills , poverty , are the seed-bed in which international conflicts tend to germinate . 
In this context , we call on the international community to support appropriately the commendable efforts of the Palestinian Authority for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories and to consolidate the institutional and socio-economic structures of the emerging Palestinian entity so that it will be able to fulfil its responsibilities in the best possible conditions . 
We should not lose sight of the efforts and activities by Africa to promote , enhance and achieve sustained economic growth and social development by addressing existing structural weaknesses , particularly building and expanding inadequate human , institutional and infrastructural capacities .  
This is being accomplished by means of a coordinated , innovative social policy strategy which , in the context of gradual institutional changes , sets aside the State as the sole centralizing entity .  
The New Partnerships Initiative ( NPI ) announced by the Vice-President at the Social Summit emphasizes work at the local level to build sustainable institutional capacity in three areas non-governmental organization empowerment across sectors , small - business partnerships and democratic local governance as well as efforts at the national level to ensure a supportive policy , regulatory and resource environment for private and community action .

Aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace in Central America , and bearing in mind that the Central American Integration System constitutes the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development can be promoted in an effective , orderly and coherent manner ,  
Demilitarization , the control of small arms , institutional reform , improved police and judicial systems , the monitoring of human rights , electoral reform and social and economic development can be as valuable in preventing conflict as in healing the wounds after conflict has occurred .

Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
All the main multilateral banks emphasize the need for forest-sector investment lending to be preceded by strong sectoral analysis , policy dialogue and institutional reform , including taking steps to improve regulatory and legal frameworks in forestry and to integrate sector aims and objectives with wider economic and environmental concerns .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .

Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
The Commission on Sustainable Development can play an important role in the coordination of bilateral and multilateral efforts to support institutional networking at the country level , with the objective of better enabling the utilization of expertise available in countries and international organizations or of developing approaches that have already been undertaken .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
The purpose of integrated plans and strategies is to develop a consensual vision for the future and to identify common priority issues and key activities within a framework that provides for consensus-building and planning and the creation of the institutional support required for sustainable development .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
In the view of the authors , the significant international financial support anticipated by the Programme of Action has not materialized ; the science and technology policies and programmes of the United Nations system are hardly coordinated around strategic goals ; institutional and programme adjustments are inadequate and a common operational science and technology framework is absent .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and that they are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .

See E / CN . 17 / 1994 / CRP . 2 .  
Based on the recognition that the TCDC mandate , as reflected in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action and reinforced by General Assembly resolution 33 / 134 of 19 December 1978 , which endorsed the Plan of Action , is an independent and clearly articulated imperative of international cooperation , supporting institutional arrangements will need to reflect this reality . 
At the same time , since ONUSAL will be withdrawing on 30 April 1995 , the Human Rights Division has been emphasizing the urgent need to implement those parts of the peace agreements concerning human rights which are still pending , a matter which is of the utmost importance if El Salvador is to complete the framework of legal and institutional safeguards required in order to achieve democracy and lasting peace .  
The main purpose will be to establish a system of coordination and operation which , within the existing level of institutional management capacity , would lead to better planning and operational management by the United Nations system as a whole , with the result that scarce human and material resources are utilized more appropriately in the provision and coordination of humanitarian assistance in the context of the overall work of the United Nations system .  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
To mitigate the heavy burdens of the poor , the Social Fund for Development ( SFD ) was established in 1991 as a temporary step to enhance structural adjustment programmes as well as to contribute to social well-being and protect vulnerable and low-income groups .  SFD executes six programmes , dealing with public works , community development , enterprise development , employment and retraining , institutional development and public transport .  
In 1994 , these activities included preparatory work - state-of-the-art surveys , definition of a conceptual framework and institutional linkages for future programme action - in two main areas : ethics and governance , and the interface between political , institutional and economic aspects of governance .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
This entails the need for modernized institutional mechanisms and processes to enable Governments to respond effectively to the complex and changing needs of societies , including demands for viable economic growth , efficient integration of social and economic policies and greater responsiveness and participatory processes .  
As a result , the Governments of Belarus , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Lithuania , Poland , the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic have requested UNDP and ILO to assist them in the development of institutions and human resources , and the strengthening of various skills such as managerial , educational , entrepreneurial , human and institutional structures at the local level .  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
Services on organizational and institutional issues affecting national statistical services ; implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts ; economic , social and demographic statistics ; electronic interchange and networking ; design and development of government information systems ; and technical and substantive support to the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific ;  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
In the Mission 's view , the National Police 's key role in fighting impunity calls for sweeping reforms of its institutional bases and of the process used to select and train its officers , in order to correct its structural and professional weaknesses and to supply it with new resources .  
The broad spectrum of activities of the countries covered above shows that the strategic planning initiative is not one specific blueprint but more of an agenda , an institutional vision which helps to direct , monitor and track performance to stated goals and objectives .  
With regard to the institution-building process , it was said that despite the many daily problems and challenges , the institutional development should not be carried out on an ad hoc basis , but be seen in its local , regional and national dimensions , which required strategic thinking and vision .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
It is India 's considered view that before the Security Council embarks on any action to formally give itself a " role in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction " , all substantive , legal and institutional issues , including the role of specific treaty bodies , must be addressed and resolved through an open and transparent debate among the full membership of the United Nations .  
The operational and administrative procedures that the ministries use to conduct their day-to-day business need to be improved , and there needs to be ( a ) a degree of decentralization of decision-making to qualified managers and technical specialists ; ( b ) a building up of a professional civil service based on merit ; ( c ) an improvement in communication flows within the ministries ; and ( d ) a procedure for record-keeping in order to establish a solid foundation for institutional memory . 
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
The international community has recognized that sustaining a secure and stable environment is essential to promote the economic , social and institutional development necessary for a lasting restoration of democracy in Haiti .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
Their outcome must be accepted and respected by all parties , and supported by a strong institutional framework which must be shaped , sustained and strengthened on a continuing basis .  
Political will , a flexible and gradual approach , a favourable economic environment , the involvement of the private sector and relevant sectors of civil society , appropriate institutional and physical infrastructure as well as creative networking were among the factors contributing to such success .  
The Organization also stated that its activities directly addressed , inter alia , such issues raised in the programme for the third term of the Decade as the problem of ILO Conventions that had not achieved wide ratification , institutional means of action regarding the implementation of international labour standards , the ILO programme of work relevant to the progressive development of such standards and future trends in this regard in ILO 's specialized field .  
The Consultative Committee also published the outcome and proceedings of the special meeting on developing legal and institutional guidelines for privatization and post-privatization regulatory framework , held at Tokyo in January 1994 , which included the draft text of such guidelines .  
Paragraph 38 ( b ) of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 specifically stated : " The United Nations system at the country level should be tailored , taking into account the views of the recipient Government , to the specific developmental needs of the country in such a way that they correspond to the ongoing and projected programmes rather than to the institutional structure of the United Nations " .  
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
Capital has become more mobile than ever across the world , owing to a combination of policies that encourage foreign investment in many developing economies with the rapid advance in computer-based telecommunication technology ; and the growth in the size of institutional investors ( mutual funds , pension funds , and so on ) .  
The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .

Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) was hampered by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
Besides being designed to update the existing 1963 data ( all information gathered from the country 's most recent census in 1971 was destroyed in the 1972 earthquake ; attempts to prepare a census since 1980 were suspended due to conflict ) , the census had as a subsidiary objective the institutional strengthening of the INEC .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
But a lot more needs to be learned : the numbers involved world wide , their geographical distribution , their precise needs , how they are being met and by whom , the status of the internally displaced in international law , and the adequacy of the coverage through existing international institutional arrangements for their protection and assistance .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
With the prospect of peace in sight , there was hope that the process of healing the wounds left by acts of unspeakable brutality could be successful if underpinned by firm institutional and legal guarantees and adequate rehabilitation efforts .  
the imbalance between the increasing responsibilities that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council had given that Branch and the institutional and financial means at its disposal could not be ignored , especially in the light of the growing crime rate , which was directly related to the tremendous corrupting power and the increasingly sophisticated methods of criminal organizations .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;

the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
We are eager for greater efficiency and competitiveness in the public sector , for ongoing improvement in the provision of services , for excellence in public services , for the application of the most modern managerial techniques , for social marketing and for ethics in public service , which requires respect for such specific values as institutional loyalty and transparency of procedures .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
The heads of Government adopted a package of recommendations aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the region to the impact of natural occurrences , improving and expanding the region 's risk acceptance capacity , the development of strong and effective insurance regulation and regulatory capacity , and at strengthening the institutional base for national disaster mitigation , forecasting and assessment .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
Enhanced international technical assistance and advisory services can decisively strengthen national capacities and the institutional bases for supporting national plans and strategies that are designed to bring about sustained and sustainable social development .  
The mid-term review of the implementation of this important political pact highlights not only the great sacrifices made by the African countries in introducing both structural and institutional reforms and the efforts of the international community to support economic recovery and social development in Africa , but also the long road that remains to be travelled to attain the main objectives of the programme .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
For decades , Central America has experienced repeated conflict and violence and has been afflicted by civil war and confrontation that left a well-known aftermath of social injustice , institutional fragility and economic disruption .  
The international community is aware that the Central American region is trying to lay to rest the painful process of internal conflict and is moving into a new stage of institutional and economic reconstruction .  
We are convinced that progress in the political and institutional areas in Central America can be consolidated only if they are accompanied by similar progress in economic development and by considerable reconstruction of the social fabric in those countries .  
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
But what is more important in the institutional and mechanism frameworks is that the first special session gave the United Nations , and especially the General Assembly , its primary deliberative body , a key role to play in disarmament and greater responsibility in the process of seeking general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
Particularly relevant were : the country 's limited economic capacities , depending on farm production which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Other recommendations included the need to identify pivotal countries to serve as catalysts for promoting and implementing TCDC , the promotion of triangular cooperation arrangements under which donors agreed to fund exchanges among developing countries , the identification of subject-specific TCDC products , the expansion of TCDC-INRES into a multidimensional database , including information on several relevant centres of excellence , expert services and project experiences , as well as supporting the already existing institutional capacities in the developing countries .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Responding to questions raised by the Committee with respect to article 1 , she noted that exemptions from the principle of equality were based on objective criteria and precise rules formulated as laws following broad consultations with institutional and other partners .  Their purpose was to permit certain territorial adaptations in the organization of the principles recognized in the Constitution ; the principles themselves could not be changed .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
However , the progress made towards establishing the institutional and physical infrastructure for the active involvement of the public and private sector in the economy , though notable , fell short of expectations , which appeared to have been overly optimistic .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
The project aims at identifying those criteria and indicators that can be considered objective , cost-effective and relevant in the assessment of the sustainability of prevailing forest management practices , taking into account parameters related to ecological , institutional , social and economic conditions and needs .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
Noting the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , concerning the problem of internal displacement ,  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
There is ample evidence that a weak bureaucracy , coupled with an ineffective judicial system , tends to generate an inefficient implementation of the formal institutional structure .  
The seminar , which will take place at Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan , from 10 to 12 June 1996 , will deal with the following issues : national reports on drugs and organized crime , including a review of existing legislative and institutional frameworks for prevention and control ; impact of drugs and organized crime on security , democracy and economic reform ; prevention and control of corruption ; money-laundering ; legal and institutional reform ; and regional and international cooperation : conclusions and recommendations .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Stressing the importance of an efficient and effective public sector as the basic framework for stable and sustainable institutional and human development in all countries ,  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
Typically , such a process should include ( i ) assessing the hydroclimatic , hydrographic and demographic conditions ; ( ii ) establishing water management objectives ; ( iii ) formulating and evaluating alternative resource management actions , implementation tools and institutional arrangements ; ( iv ) assessing the impacts of promising alternatives ; and ( v ) choosing and implementing the preferred course of action .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
The foreseeable developments in the international context - economic , political and institutional - following the Uruguay Round and the advance of regional and subregional integration agreements can offer some opportunities for countries whose productive and export-driven development has been retarded ; nevertheless , they also entail a significant erosion of the opportunities for implementing selective policies to promote such development .  
The fourth objective is to promote the establishment of regional institutional mechanisms to guarantee the full collaboration and participation of women in the main spheres of economic , political and social development .  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
To strengthen the institutional capacity of Governments and communities for the development , utilization and commercialization of new and renewable energy sources ; to develop national and indigenous capacity in assessment and management of energy resources and services ; to introduce changes in energy consumption patterns , focusing on conservation measures and demand-side management ; to facilitate international and interregional connections for the transmission of electric power and transport of natural gas ; and to promote technology transfer to different levels of government , civil society , community institutions and entrepreneurs .  
In relation to natural resources and energy , it focused on addressing issues of institutional management , defining the roles of the State , particularly in regard to privatization and regulation , contributing to the design and application of public policies for integrated natural resources management and providing support for the regional implementation of international environmental agreements that relate to natural resource management .  
A more systematic and sustained process of building and nurturing national human and institutional capacities is required , tailored to each country 's strengths and weaknesses , to help integrate the different dimensions of development , including that of economic and social rights , and to design , manage and execute complex programmes and projects .  
The project foresees technical assistance from UNCTAD , primarily in the establishment of institutional , operational and managerial capacities , and the necessary legal framework for the proper setting up and functioning of the port .  
In 1995 , in close collaboration with the Palestinian Authority , the Programme prepared the project entitled " Multi-sectoral drug control assistance to the Palestinian Authority " , which will provide technical assistance ( a ) to establish a drug control institutional framework ; ( b ) to reduce the illicit supply of narcotic drugs through improved detection , interdiction and prosecution capacities ; and ( c ) to prevent and reduce drug abuse through improved awareness , treatment and rehabilitation methods .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
Adopt measures , prior to the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace , and without detriment to the legal dissolution of the voluntary civil defence committees , to eradicate and put a stop to the establishment of organizations of varying names and origins , including some of those established to replace disbanded voluntary civil defence committees , which carry out State functions , such as security or public order , outside the institutional framework of the State .  
Adopt , within its sphere of competence , a set of measures to enable the Public Prosecutor 's Office to play the role assigned to it , with a view to : ( i ) establishing hierarchical supervision over the National Police and other security forces ; ( ii ) preventing interference from other State entities in the Office 's work ; ( iii ) providing the necessary institutional support to prosecutors who are responsible for cases involving human rights violations ; and ( iv ) protecting the physical integrity of the Office 's personnel ;  
The FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 1995 endorsed the creation of a Fisheries Technical Assistance Programme for small island developing States , focusing on the following priority areas , as identified by countries : institutional strengthening and capacity-building ; conservation and management of fisheries in the exclusive economic zone ; improved post-harvest management and marketing ; safety at sea ; strengthening the economic role of national fisheries industries ; and aquaculture and inland fisheries conservation and management .  
At national , subnational and local levels capacity-building is a key objective for several reasons : ( a ) forest management action is effected at these levels , ( b ) many countries do not have the institutional capacity to design and to implement strategies for the management of their forest resources , and ( c ) FAO and other international organizations concerned depend for their data collection on information that countries have already collected for their own purposes .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
This is a sign that confidence in at least the medium run is being restored and that key institutional reforms , as well as a reasonable degree of macroeconomic and political stability , are being attained .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
To urge donors and international organizations to support the establishment of regional and national institutional systems dedicated to undertaking systematic studies on TFRK and to promote its wide understanding and use .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .  
It called for an effective regional institutional mechanism to provide for a harmonized approach to transit transport matters , and it urged all concerned international and regional organizations to strengthen their activities which promoted regionally adopted legal and administrative solutions that facilitated regional and international transport and trade .  
The basic NFP principles recognize the following key elements ( see document E / CN . 17 / IPF / 1996 / 8 ) : national sovereignty ; integration with a country 's sustainable development strategy ; partnership ; participation ; a holistic and intersectoral approach ; a long-term iterative process ; capacity-building ; policy and institutional reforms ; consistency with national policy frameworks and global initiatives ; awareness-raising ; and harmony with national and international commitments .  
None of the existing international legal instruments , as they currently stand , may have the potential to fully ensure a coordinated approach in international policy , financial issues and integration at the institutional level regarding forests and forest-related activities .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
It requested the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly at its fifty-first session on further institutional developments related to the strengthening of international organizations in the area of multilateral trade and , in preparing that report , to solicit the views of all Governments , competent regional economic integration organizations and the executive heads of the competent specialized agencies and of other organizations and programmes of the United Nations system on this matter . 
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Furthermore , the provisions of the resolution should be taken fully into account and implemented in a comprehensive and integrated manner , comprising all the necessary elements at the national and international levels , particularly those related to technology transfer , financial resources and enabling international economic environment through new initiatives for strengthening institutional capacity for enhancing international development cooperation .  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
The project will assist Governments and regional institutions in strengthening capability for monitoring and analysing climate and sea level trends ; identify areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea level rise ; develop an integrated management and planning framework ; enhance regional and national capabilities through human resource development and institutional strengthening ; identify and assess policy operations and instruments ; and collect information for preparing national communications .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
With financial support from Germany , preparatory work is already under way on a high-impact programme for entrepreneurship development among women , under which 10 national programmes will be elaborated , each aimed at releasing the principal technical , managerial , financial , institutional and policy constraints affecting the development of women 's entrepreneurship .  
International strategies of cooperation and coordination are outlined in the Habitat Agenda , chapter IV , section E . The main strategic objectives and activities presented in that section cover the establishment of an international enabling environment ; issues of international finance , external debt and trade ; the promotion of the transfer of technology and exchange of information ; and the provision of support to technical and institutional cooperation .  
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
Section I contains information on the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council , which have been grouped , on the basis of their institutional status , into six categories : ( a ) functional commissions , ( b ) regional commissions , ( c ) standing committees , ( d ) expert bodies composed of governmental experts , ( e ) expert bodies composed of members serving in their personal capacity and ( f ) related bodies .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
For example , many countries have reported initiatives which have been taken in fields as diverse as information activities and awareness-building among different categories of actors ; creation of the institutional tools required for the follow-up of proposed activities ; and preparation for national forums by , inter alia , organizing the first decentralized consultations , conducting a number of thematic studies and strengthening the consultative processes aimed at the signing of joint venture agreements .  
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .  
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The Tunisian Government is convinced that scientific and technological progress constitutes a fundamental right of Tunisians and it intends by these institutional measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the national research system in order to promote rapid development of science and technology and their dissemination throughout Tunisia 's society and economy , thus binding Tunisia firmly to the world economy and preventing its marginalization from universal progress . 
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Such work may also require international support for related activities at the national level , including technical cooperation activities to strengthen national policy and institutional instruments , and the domestic capabilities needed for this purpose , in the specific areas concerned . 
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
Other issues that must be addressed included the problems faced by developing countries , particularly those in Africa , concerning access to markets , capital and technology , unfavourable institutional arrangements and inadequate capacity for their meaningful integration into the world economy .  
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
Special attention will be paid to measures designed to improve the whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  We believe , however , that it is crucial for the international community to provide these new institutions with sufficient resources to enable them to discharge their important functions .  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
His delegation was also encouraged by regional activities designed to implement Agenda 21 and by the fact that , at the national level , approximately 100 countries had reformed their institutional structures with a view to achieving sustainable development .  
Despite the economic and technological difficulties it faced , Colombia had introduced sweeping legislative , institutional and administrative reforms for environmental protection .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management ; the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
Also important is the fact that the United Nations Charter , which might be called an institutional pillar of the Organization , is a highly balanced document , free of any visible bias in one direction or another , and this has allowed it to become , one might say , a code of modern international relations that no civilized State has any right to ignore .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .  
Mr . Thiebaud ( France ) ( interpretation from French ) : The General Assembly is being asked today to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti ( MICIVIH ) to 31 December 1998 , in response to the wishes expressed by President Ren Pr � al in his letter dated 10 November 1997 to the Secretary-General , in which he requested the continued support of that Mission to carry out the institutional consolidation that is essential for a state of law and for the deepening of the democratic process in Haiti .  
The conditions that prevailed prior to the establishment of the zones included , inter alia , peaceful relations and mutual confidence , economic cooperation and a general belief in the enhancement of common interests through institutional regional frameworks .  
In the past five years , in line with this policy , Colombia has set up a regulatory and institutional framework , ranging from the establishment of the Ministry for the Environment to the creation of an environmental network enabling the authorities and the community to take part in the national and local decision-making process relating to the environment .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
Until waste management authorities overcome these institutional shortcomings and develop a more flexible management structure , responsive to the needs of public , private and community sectors , isolated schemes will remain good examples of " best practice demonstrations " and will not be incorporated into the overall waste management system .  
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
This national undertaking calls for an implementation strategy that sets realistic priorities for gradual fulfilment of the various aspects of the Peace Agreements as and when the political , institutional , financial and technical bases for their implementation are established ,  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .  A first step in that direction would be for Headquarters to provide urgent assistance by assigning to Nairobi for one month a senior administrator with proven experience in the establishment and functioning of United Nations common services outputs ( SP-96-001-19 ) .  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
The exercise will involve mapping poverty at district and subdistrict levels through an in-depth participatory poverty assessment survey nationwide ; the preparation of national guidelines for community involvement in development activities ; training and institutional strengthening for intersectoral coordination and articulation between central and local governments ; and revamping of the country 's poverty monitoring system for use in decentralized policy and programme evaluation on a continuous basis .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
FLNKS believes that the local partners in the Matignon Accords should also be in a position to resume bilateral discussions on the country 's institutional future before the whole range of political groups , social and professional categories , and traditional institutions is associated with the approach advocated by FLNKS .  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
There is a need for a broad spectrum of quantitative , qualitative and descriptive indicators covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional , legal and policy elements , including land tenure .  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
In part , this would be due to rising income and per capita consumption , overall export growth , moderate inflation and modest current account deficits projected for South , East and South-East Asian countries . 6 To some extent , it can be anticipated that there will be a further intensification of regional cooperation within the various institutional arrangements currently in existence .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
After extended discussions during which the relevant institutional and political actors sought to identify potential solutions to this problem , the Government decided to promulgate a decree establishing a temporary legal mechanism which would extend special documentation facilitating access to pension benefits .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
We are all aware that the Government and people of Haiti bear the principal responsibility for the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of the country , but we also know that , if long-term peace and stability are to be attained , it is indispensable that the international community make a sustained commitment to cooperation .  That is why we are present here today .  
Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
The Assembly also stressed that , in the light of the ongoing discussions on reform within the United Nations , international institutional arrangements in the area of sustainable development were intended to contribute to the goal of strengthening the entire United Nations system .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
The draft resolution was essentially a procedural document dealing with institutional links between the United Nations and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the necessary financial support , but listed in its preambular part the main events that had occurred during the year pursuant to the Convention , which was of crucial importance to many developing countries . 
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .

However , these improvements would remain transitory and frail unless accompanied by policies at both the national and the international levels favourable to strong institutional and technological capacity-building .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .

The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
In most cases , however , the growth processes remain fragile and the outlook is surrounded by considerable uncertainty . 4 While high inflation rates have been largely reduced to more manageable levels , prices still do not guide economic activity to the degree common in most market economies , as enterprise governance and institutional frameworks for business decision-making are still in transition .

From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .

The promotion of the Portuguese language , spoken today by more than 200-million people , the new modalities of institutional cooperation which have been established and the coordination of the diplomatic and political positions of the founder countries in the many international forums involved , have made this organization , despite its youth , an attentive participant within the international community .  The problems associated with the many components of the drug phenomenon are among the biggest challenges faced by our societies today .  
We agreed on the broadest possible review and modernization of our regional institutional framework , as we were convinced that the benefits of development to which our people are entitled can not be tapped by each country separately they are attainable only to a regional community , because of the dynamics of today 's increasingly interdependent environment .

Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .

Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .

The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
Indeed there is little evidence that Habitat has an institutional memory in the sense that it is capable either of presenting in a succinct form the essential lessons of working in the field of human settlements over the last 25 years , or that it would be possible to construct a computerized expert system based on the knowledge recorded and available within Habitat that could respond to basic randomly generated questions in this area .

Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
While consultation between the United Nations system and bilateral donors is generalized in all countries of the regions , there are cases where this consultation process is supported by special institutional arrangements , that is , donor contact groups , beyond the consultative group and round-table mechanisms , where the Government may request the United Nations system , or the resident coordinator , to support national efforts in this area .  
The lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with conditions of inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems , poses serious constraints on the trade and economic development of landlocked developing countries .  
Measures to deal with the transit problems of such countries have to address a broad range of factors , such as inadequate infrastructure , imbalance of trade , inefficient transport organization , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
Promoting the formulation , adoption and implementation of appropriate technical , institutional , administrative and legal measures contributing to improved protection of marine and coastal environment , including the rational use and conservation of their resources .  
Abilities essential to the reduction of natural and similar disasters are increasingly being drawn from the public sector , professional and institutional organizations , commercial interests and local forms of community leadership . 
In addition , it decided to appoint Mrs . Mara Concepcin Bautista to prepare a report on the application of international standards concerning the human rights of detained juveniles , in particular the separation of juvenile and adult offenders in penal institutions , detention pending trial , least possible use of institutionalization and the objectives of institutional treatment .  
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
Governments at local , regional and national levels should recognize the role of multiple identities in contributing to open communities and in establishing useful distinctions between public institutional structures and cultural identities ;  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time-frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
This plan revolves around seven priority areas : first , improvement of the living conditions of women ; second , improvement of the legal status of women ; third , development of female human resources in all the development sectors ; fourth , access by women to effective decision-making ; fifth , promotion and protection of the girl child ; sixth , combatting violence against women ; and seventh , improvement of the institutional framework .  
Noting the desire and ardent wish of all the political , economic and social actors in the Comoros to see the country return as early as possible to a normal and stable republican system capable of bringing about economic and social development through the establishment of a new institutional framework ,  
The programme it drew up is based on consciousness _ raising , the adoption of a common law against the practice , institutional capacity _ building in the national committees , which should , it is said , be attached to the departments in charge of the campaign against female genital mutilation , the conversion of female excisionists , and the formulation of a media plan .  
The General Assembly thus established both a clearly structured functional platform and institutional base , as well as a 10-year programme of action , guided by the overall objective as mentioned above , and built around the following main goals :  
Based on programme areas defined by the Scientific and Technical Committee and implemented through thematic and regional meetings , the plan of action was focused on concrete goals in the fields of ( a ) continued advocacy , ( b ) development of policies , and ( c ) coordination of institutional capacities .  
Strengthening and supporting the activities of the regional centres , established at the initiative of the United Nations pursuant to General Assembly resolution 45 / 72 of 11 December 1990 , calls for concerted effort by various agencies with a view to sustaining , inter alia , their educational activities , infrastructure development and the institutional and organizational framework .  
Finally , recent experience has demonstrated a fundamental problem of the global economy , namely the enormous discrepancy that exists between an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic international financial world , with rapid globalization of financial portfolios , and the lack of a proper institutional framework to manage it .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .  
A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
In assisting the PA to develop institutional and managerial capacities essential to sound policy-making , UNCTADs assistance to the Palestinian people also helps to enable Palestine to emerge as a distinct actor in the regional and global economic arenas .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
There needs to be a deepening of domestic capital markets , within an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and with the development of a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
On this basis , I am confident that an appropriate mechanism will be found to meet the aspirations of the Government of Haiti as well as the desire of the international community to elaborate a long-term , coordinated and well-managed plan for Haiti 's sustainable social , economic and institutional development .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
States in the region demonstrated their growing recognition that refugee problems need to be addressed through the creation of effective legislative and institutional frameworks that are consistent with international standards .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
Within its current severe financial and staffing constraints , the Institute has been able to implement a modest but promising substantive programme of work , thus demonstrating its institutional potential and proving its capability to fulfil its unique role in pursuit of the advancement of women and gender equality .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries , long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations , was the lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
It has established regular meetings with the Ministers of Justice in both entities to ensure that political , technical and institutional impediments to the proper functioning of the judiciary are being positively addressed .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Three in particular stand out : the return to stability and growth has not been the result of a unique formula ; the severe economic and social consequences of the crisis have highlighted the need to strengthen institutional structures at the international and national levels ; and corrective domestic policies have to be complemented by resolute international support measures .  
On a broader front , meaningful partnership requires more inclusive and democratic institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making which would ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
It agreed on the need for good governance , an efficient administrative and institutional support structure , adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors ( A / 54 / 316 , para .  44 ) .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
In furtherance of the aims of the World Programme of Action concerning disabled persons , ILO was seeking to equalize employment opportunities for persons with disabilities , by advising member States on developing appropriate legislative and institutional frameworks based on its Conventions , building a supportive environment for the social and economic integration of disabled persons , as well as a code of practice on managing disability and related matters in the workplace .  
In particular , small island developing States such as Fiji could not receive an equitable share of the benefits of the global trading system without improved market access , special and differential treatment of their products and enhanced institutional capacity to make the most of global trading opportunities .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security , often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
In keeping with that commitment , the countries of the Central American Group had established the legal and institutional framework for social development based on the principles of mutual cooperation , solidarity and realization of the full potential of men and women in the region as well as on overcoming the structural factors that gave rise to poverty in the subregion .  
Solutions to those complex environmental challenges required differentiated approaches that would place enormous demands on policy design and implementation at all levels and would require solid and concerted institutional responses .  
In addition , WIPO had established a specific institutional mechanism , the Worldwide Academy , which was dedicated to optimizing the use of intellectual property systems by enhancing human resources development programmes at the national and regional levels .  
Mr . Christian Tomuschat , the Commissions Coordinator , detailed its main conclusions and recommendations the fruit of a year and a half of work on the human rights violations and acts of violence which occurred during the internal armed conflict .  In its conclusions , the Commission stated that at least 83 per cent of the victims were Mayan and attributed institutional responsibility for 93 per cent of the violations to agents of the State , principally members of the army .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
MICIVIH currently has responsibility for providing institutional assistance ( with particular reference to the police , judiciary , the penal system , the Ombudsmans Office and civil society organizations ) , supporting the promotion and protection of human rights and verifying observance of individual rights , fundamental freedoms and due process requirements .  
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
The Registrys requirements for contractual services are estimated at $ 19,649,200 , reflecting an increase of $ 1,005,900 , owing to the revised detainee service agreements , the commencement of French verbatim reporting by an institutional contractor and increased requirements for contractual translation to meet urgent requirements caused by trial and appeal activities ( see A / 54 / 518 , para .  54 ) .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
I , General legislative and institutional framework , para . 25 ) , one of the initial steps that should be taken by the Government in relation to a proposed infrastructure project is to conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
A continuing debate on institutional issues was essential in order to promote a stable and equitable international financial system that was supportive of long-term development .  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
The creation of socialist systems appeared as a gigantic experiment in organizational and institutional innovation that met with significant initial success in achieving some important development targets set by communist regimes ( other objectives , like consumption increases or popular participation having early been deliberately sacrificed or postponed ) .  
A kind of systemic lock-in made itself increasingly felt , owing to the coherence of the classical system ( Kornai , 1992 ) and to the strong restraints set by the institutional base ( mono-party communist regime combined with domination of State ownership ) on genuine technological , organizational and institutional adaptive change .  
In these trajectories , interdependent phenomena of political change , institutional shift , macroeconomic trends and social tendencies have generally reinforced each other and produced specific configuration of cumulative causation processes .  
The diversity of national and regional paths of change , leading to a significant variety of post-socialist emerging capitalisms ( Magnin , 1999 ) , illustrates the role of idiosyncratic and evolving institutional configurations that represent the very content of systemic change .  
The Chinese trajectory , however , where these factors are absent , also points to the decisive role of State capacity in the virtuous growth path that accompanied gradual and uneven institutional reforms over a period of two decades ( as exemplified in the agricultural reforms , the open-door policy , the transitional dual-track regime in industry and the change in the fiscal system Chavance , forthcoming in 2000 ) .  
The change of rules in general institutional and organizational rules , constitutional and ordinary rules , and formal and informal rules represents the essential content of systemic change , hence the decisive role of law and the State in the process . 
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
In the social and economic fields , the United Nations plays a unique role in the development process on the African continent by continuously supporting the building of the OAUs institutional capacities to promote regional economic integration of the States of Africa and to enhance the continents ability to take advantage of international and bilateral initiatives to promote development .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
Create and or encourage the creation and strengthening of institutional mechanisms at all levels , including taking all measures to ensure that national machineries as well as focal points within specific institutions are not marginalized in the administrative structure but supported at the highest possible level of government and entrusted with clearly defined mandates which define their function as a policy advisory body ;  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
Such policies should be complemented by other measures for promoting efficient and clean energy that take into account the widely differing institutional , social , economic , technical and natural resource endowment in individual countries and regions .  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
In effect , the creation of secondary markets in mortgages is a subject to which increasing attention is being paid in the housing finance sector in the Latin American countries , where strong legislative , institutional and enabling initiatives are being taken towards that end.Indeed , various Latin American countries have been implementing or enhancing this mechanism .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The development of renewable energy sources will depend not only on the choice of appropriate technology but also on adequate development of managerial and technical expertise , careful financial management and adoption of appropriate institutional approaches .  
For small loads typical of rural households in remote areas with sufficient insolation , solar PV systems are proving to be economically and technically successful , when complemented by an institutional approach , including financial arrangements , that provides for the installation of the systems and maintenance on a fee-for-service basis .  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time _ frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
From a legislative perspective , it is important to devise institutional arrangements for the regulatory functions which ensure to the regulatory body an adequate level of efficiency , taking into account the political , legal and administrative tradition of the country .  
Thus , since 1995 , INDAP has explicitly mainstreamed a gender perspective in its regular institutional activities , meaning that a cross-cutting approach will be taken to each of its activities and measures , based on the recognition of rural families as a basic unit of the production process , with different requirements according to their composition and specific members ( men , women , young people , older persons , relatives , etc . ) .  
The more flexible and efficient work methods required by a closer association with private-sector and NGO partners will accelerate current efforts to modernize and adapt UNCTADs institutional and managerial culture to the realities of economic development , thus complementing recent structural changes in the organization .  
Since the sixth session of the Commission , a functioning prototype of the system has been developed , consisting of a revised international site and a demonstration national node , and mock-ups of regional and institutional nodes .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
An estimated amount of $ 152 , 000 , at the maintenance level , would be required for official travel of the staff of the Division to participate in global , regional , subregional and national conferences , meetings , seminars and symposia that call for coordination and the Divisions input for statistical development ; to assist Member States in institutional development in statistics ; and to ensure collaboration and liaison with the regional commissions on matters relating to statistical development .  
In this context , the programme will deal with electoral mechanisms and processes , parliaments and other representative bodies , institutional machinery designed to facilitate participation in the elaboration , implementation , monitoring and evaluation of public policies , management of diversity and consensus-building , judicial systems , legal and regulatory framework and establishing conditions of predictability about where businesses can operate productively and experience innovative growth .  
The proposals below seek to refine the institutional identity of ECLAC as the only regional institution that takes a systematic approach to the examination of development issues facing the Latin American and Caribbean countries from a regional perspective by combining analytical work with operational initiatives in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
This relates to issues of access where the potential of HDI projects is restricted by the physical deficiencies of infrastructure and the critical role played by access to and from villages in meeting HDI objectives ; the institutional arrangements under which HDI projects operates because of its special mandate ; and the short time-frame of two and a half years for the duration of HDI projects as compared to the normal UNDP country cooperation framework .  
Where BDS are strategically important but not yet adapted to local needs , joint efforts by public and private institutions have proven effective institutional responses .  
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
While control over the regulation of all aspects of the production and supply of drugs and psychotropic substances had been tightened in health care and scientific institutions and in the chemical industry , severely weakened institutional accountability , as well as an underdeveloped system for formulating and implementing regulations impeded control and oversight .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
From a legislative perspective , it is important to devise institutional arrangements for the regulatory functions that ensure to the regulatory agency an adequate level of efficiency , taking into account the political , legal and administrative tradition of the country .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , inter alia through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
This can be attained only through generous financial assistance from the industrialized world directed towards improving and enhancing weak infrastructures and augmenting national institutional capacities .  
However , the view was expressed that statutory language by itself was not sufficient to establish a functioning insolvency regime ; what was required was a strong institutional structure that was both accountable and transparent .  
While there was no single model to resolve the problem of underdevelopment , international cooperation was increasingly necessary for the strengthening and sharing of the human , institutional , economic and technical capacities of States .  
This new framework is a holistic and integrated approach to development strategies and programs that highlights the interdependence of all aspects of development strategy : social , human , institutional , environmental , economic and financial .  
Such partnership requires more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decisionmaking so as to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis .  
While convincing results have been achieved in building institutional memory in specific substantive subject areas , such repositories of knowledge remain compartmentalized , with crosscutting access either difficult or nonexistent .  
Inadequate budgetary allocations for the social sectors , slow disbursement of available funds , weak institutional and human resources capacities , and unreasonably low salary levels for civil servants are constraints common to all sectors .  
Governments need to develop a suitable legal and institutional environment to facilitate active partnerships with the private sector in a manner that ensures the provision of services to the urban and rural poor .  
In close coordination with local and national authorities , steps to promote social and institutional advances can help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
Mobilizing the skills and other resources of diverse global actors , therefore , may increasingly involve forming loose and temporary global policy networks that cut across national , institutional and disciplinary lines .  
There is however no easy fix for the institutional impediments in many developing countries , above all unsupportive regulatory environments and exorbitant charges imposed by national authorities .  
UNDP will work in close coordination with local and national authorities to take steps to promote social and institutional advances to help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
The objective is to enable African countries to achieve economic and social development through accelerated human and institutional capacity development as well as agricultural and private sector development .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
Reference should be made , for instance , to how the legal and institutional frameworks are geared to supporting or hindering private domestic and foreign investments .  
The establishment of pluralistic democracy has led to profound changes , both at the level of the legal and institutional environment and at the economic , social and cultural level .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
An institutional focal point at the national level , with its counterparts at decentralized levels , enables a country to evolve a coherent and coordinated approach with the involvement of relevant entities in the public and private sectors , and with NGOs .  
Policy and institutional reforms to create a sound socioeconomic and political environment to transform the social and productive basis for development into one in which sustainable , equitable and genderbalanced development can take place .  
In focusing on such key elements as promotion of awareness , advocacy and policy formulation ; connectivity ; institutional and human capacities ; and content and cultural diversity , UNDP currently operates global , regional and numerous countrylevel programmes .  
Three sets of factors can be proffered : the low savings base ( subsistence income levels ) ; weak institutional base for intermediation ( thin , fragile , fragmented financial system with limited financial instruments ) ; and decapitalization . 
Montenegro is shifting to transitional initiatives , for which the international community has deepened its support , including direct bilateral aid in the form of budgetary support and technical assistance for institutional reform .  
On the internal front , the continued institutional weakness of GuineaBissaus national police , including its chronic lack of adequate logistical support , has hampered its ability to deal effectively with the rising incidence of banditry .

Any such framework should reflect a comprehensive approach to development , geared to stimulating economic growth as a basic underlying factor for a sustained attack on poverty , and encompassing and integrating structural , social and institutional reform and pro-poor policies and programmes .  The sequencing of interventions in different areas and their timing will be critical to the effectiveness of the framework .

For their part , most LDCs have pursued economic reform programmes set out in the previous Programmes of Action , including eliminating or substantially reducing tariffs and other trade barriers , liberalizing currency regimes , privatizing public enterprises , establishing and strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks and adopting liberal investment policies .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .

Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
The institutional location of Trainmar centres is not generally relevant for an integrated approach to maritime transport and commerce , or to overall national interest : there is evidence that in some cases national authorities have not been given the opportunity of considering the most opportune institutional location of the Trainmar centres as among available educational and training institutions ; there is a heavy focus on locating Trainmar centres in ports or training facilities attached to ports .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .

On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
Poor management of finances and public corporations has not been conducive to the creation of a favourable macroeconomic and institutional environment for stimulating the economic and social activities of households and enterprises .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .

These responsibilities encompass the identification of requirements , the establishment of aircraft technical specifications , the evaluation of contractors technical compliance , the administration of air charters , the management of expenditures , the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , and the integrated use of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes ;  
The most important substantive issue was likely to be institutional , namely the creation of an integrated framework acting under the auspices of the United Nations to ensure coherence in the treatment of international economic questions , avoiding in this process any negative impact on the autonomy and individual mandates of specific organizations such as the Bretton Woods institutions or the different members of the United Nations family .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .

While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
He noted the Secretary-Generals recommendation that Governments should be urged to take steps to prepare a transparent , stable and predictable framework for investment and for building institutional infrastructures and that multilateral and bilateral donors should be encouraged to adopt suitable measures to permit faster and more extensive debt relief for poor countries .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .  
A range of interests needs to be accommodated by that legal mechanismthe debtor , the owners and management of the debtor , the creditors who may be secured to varying degrees , employees , fiscal creditors , guarantors of debt and unsecured creditors , as well as government , commercial and social institutions and practices that are relevant to the design of the mechanism and to the institutional framework required for its operation .

Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
The national focal points and national coordinating bodies can promote additional and parallel consultations with different institutional and social categories and / or in different provincial / local areas in order to ensure their greater participation in the process .  
In the light of the evolving nature of the institutional support provided for the regional action programme in Asia , the Asian national focal points may agree on the modalities of reporting at the regional level , on the understanding that the task managers and hosts of the thematic programme networks of the RAP would draft the chapters of the regional report corresponding to their respective fields of activites .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,

The establishment of the socialist system furthers the development of socialized production and also eliminates the root cause of the fundamental antagonism between collective interests and individual interests .  It lays a solid material foundation and provides a fundamental institutional guarantee for the rise of collectivism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
It has accurately epitomized and given a high appraisal to the following three major changes in history .

Li Lanqing stressed : All enterprises must , on the one hand , have their eyes on the outside world , keeping abreast of the development trend of the advanced enterprises at home and abroad , and on the other hands , have their eyes on our own country , finding out the gaps , getting to know our deficiencies , and expediting institutional innovation , scientific and technological innovation , and management innovation around the enhancement of enterprises ' quality and competitiveness .  
In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
Meanwhile , the consumption structure of cars in China has gradually changed from mainly institutional purchase to mainly individual purchase to meet various demands .  The increasing rise in the ratio of individual purchase of cars has determined the pattern of China 's car market .  That is , economic cars and medium-class cars should be the leading car models in the market .  
In short , with the phenomenon that " two parts out of three are missing " existing in the current management structure , even though the targets for preserving and increasing the value of state-owned assets have been set forth , the entire management structure is incomplete for lack of distinct institutional stipulations as to how the benefits of the investors , shareholders , and operators can be achieved to the maximum .  
Meanwhile , the consumption structure of cars in China has gradually changed from mainly institutional purchase to mainly individual purchase to meet various demands .  The increasing rise in the ratio of individual purchase of cars has determined the pattern of China 's car market .  That is , economic cars and medium-class cars should be the leading car models in the market .  
Gao cited the need for active research into the " qualified foreign institutional investor system " of certain countries and areas .  Combining such a system with the actual situation in China , the limited , gradual entry of foreign investors into China 's securities markets will be allowed , as will the use of foreign capital to purchase stock ownership in some enterprises in competitive industries .  This will gradually open China 's capital markets completely to foreign investors .  
He added that apart from the gradual improvement in material conditions , a good academic research environment should include an institutional environment for scientific research , a humanistic environment , a good atmosphere for academic discussion , and harmonious interpersonal relationships .  
As for the so-called administrative monopolies , precisely as analyzed by the scholars of the State Council 's Development Research Center , with the vigorous support by a series of preferential policies by the state and nurtured by enormous investments over a long period of time , China 's rail transport , communications , electric power , coal and gas , running water , and numerous other infrastructure industries grew rapidly , and furthermore they were mainly enterprises invested in by the central or local governments which were operated as institutional monopolies .  
Carrying out comprehensive institutional reform is a strategic task set by the 15th CPC Congress , is urgently required by the establishment of a socialist market economic system , and is an important part of political system reform .  
Our country is vast in territory , with uneven economic and social development across the localities and great regional differences in the level of market maturity and resource endowments .  All this has determined that in carrying out institutional reform in the localities , it is necessary to proceed on the basis of reality and to accommodate local conditions in accordance with the center 's requirements .  
In short , the work of institutional reform is proceeding in an orderly manner in various areas .  The focus of the next step of reform is to vigorously proceed with the institutional reform of the cities , counties , and townships , changing functions , optimizing personnel structures , reducing fiscal and peasant burdens , and improving work efficiency and service quality .  It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations and study and to get well prepared for work in all areas .  
It is reported that Lee Yuan-tseh has lately been pondering deeply over cross-strait topics .  He understands that it will not be easy to synthesize differing views into a concrete conclusion , given the resistance from the major political parties and the wide political spectrum from which the task force 's members come .  However , he is still hopeful that the cross-party task force will present a set of recommendations that will get the two organizations across the Taiwan Strait to resume negotiations within the institutional framework .  
It is understood that in the current institutional reform , the State Economic and Trade Commission will adhere to the principles of further changing government functions , adjusting and reducing specialized economic departments , reducing government administrative interference in enterprises , streamlining administration , and improving efficiency .

In order to boost economic development and restructuring , it is necessary to rely on institutional innovations and scientific and technological innovations .  The continuous improvement of the people 's material and cultural life is the ultimate goal of economic development .  
At present , we should conscientiously study the knowledge relating to the socialist market economy , transform our concepts on financial and economic work , quicken the pace of building the public finance suited to China 's national conditions , further adjust and optimize the financial revenue-expenditure structure , incrementally reduce investment in the profit-making and operational spheres , vigorously cut down the administrative and institutional spending , push the operational institutions into the market , and concentrate the use of financial resources mainly on the areas of social and public necessities and social security .  
a positive fiscal policy and a sound monetary policy will be implemented to ensure policy continuity ; institutional innovations and innovations in science and technology will be accelerated to facilitate strategic adjustments to the economic structure ; and efforts will be made to make a good start for the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
Township and town enterprises should give prominence to the main theme of development , make effort to create a good public opinion , policy , and legal system environment , grasp the three key points of institutional innovation , structural adjustment , and technological progress , and effectively enhance their overall quality and efficiency .  
Based on the need to attain the strategic objectives for the third stage of China 's socialist modernization drive and the need to win the competition in comprehensive national strength in the present-day world , we must seize the opportunity , bravely press ahead , always take institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation as the driving force , and step up the development of high-tech industry in our country .  
The transformation of government functions should be made properly so that the administrative organs concerned may effectively perform their administrative functions in law enforcement .  In the course of institutional reforms , it is necessary to reinforce the contingent of pharmaceutical supervision and management personnel , adjust the structure of the contingent , focus attention on enhancing the quality of the pharmaceutical supervision and law enforcement personnel , and build an open , fair , honest , authoritative , highly efficient , and incorrupt contingent of pharmaceutical supervisors and law enforcers .

This round of institutional reform and reorganization in the State Economic and Trade Commission and its subordinate state bureaus is another major step for forming a streamlined , unified , and highly efficient administrative structure .  This step is of great significance for achieving the goal of completely separating government institutions from enterprise management , transforming government functions , establishing and improving the socialist market economic system , enhancing the work efficiency of the government institutions , and enhancing macroeconomic control .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .

Deputy Wu Yousheng said : The next five to ten years will be extremely important for our economic and social development .  In order to catch up with the swift development of the new scientific and technological revolution in the world , we must be the acknowledged leaders in institutional , scientific and technological innovation and promote the strategic restructuring of the economy .  
To make development , it is necessary to further break through various institutional and functional obstacles through reforms and further emancipate the productive forces and arouse the people 's initiative and creativity and stimulate the dynamism of our society .  Without reform , it would be hard to further advance economic development and structural readjustments .  
Delegate Zhou Shulian said that in order to ensure the smooth completion of the tasks of structural adjustment , it is necessary to overcome all kinds of institutional obstacles and establish a protective mechanism for structural optimization and upgrading .  By this he meant a mechanism for protecting the effective raising , rational distribution and efficient utilization of funds , talent , technology and other resources .  This mechanism mainly includes a rational economic system , a community of excellent entrepreneurs , scientific development strategies and industrial policies , as well as a sound and effective legal system .

Deputy Li Rixu said : To deepen reforms in state-owned enterprises and really turn them into the main entities in the market competition , it is necessary to actively explore an effective form of managing the state-owned assets , deepen the three institutional reforms inside the enterprises , establish effective incentive and self-control mechanisms ; it is also necessary to more quickly advance various supportive reforms , thus creating a benign external environment for state-owned enterprises ' reform and development .  The work of separating the government from enterprises should be further advanced .  
CPPCC committee member Li Guozhang said : The forming of a benign investment environment in the western part of the country is subject to restraints in six aspects , namely , the institutional restraints , the policy restraints , the restraints from the backward conditions of science , technology , and education , the restraints from the slow advance of the economic restructuring , the restraints from the out-of-date ideas , and the restraints from the transformation of the government functions .  
According to actual conditions , we must understand and grasp the theme of accelerating development , actively make structural readjustment with the stress on development , do a good job in making institutional and scientific and technological innovations , two major driving forces , and eventually use these driving forces for improving the people 's living standards .  
To prefect the basic economic system with public ownership as the mainstay and with the common development of all economies in different ownership forms , to perfect the distribution system with the income earned from work as the main form and with the coexistence of diverse income forms , to perfect the structure of the socialist market system , and to carry out political institutional reform , we must all rely on institutional innovations .  " Without institutional innovations , there will be no solution for many issues . "  
deepen reforms , expand opening-up , strive to make the two fundamental changes , take the initiative in advancing in the front of institutional and technological innovations , actively make use of both domestic and overseas resources , open up both domestic and international markets , gather momentum and vigor of sustained development ;

The public sector , particularly the Government , must be prepared to make bold institutional changes to secure greater efficiency and improved services , even if that means upsetting long established practices .  
The overall business environment of an economy is constituted from a host of structural and institutional factors which in general tend to change only gradually .  It is therefore not easy to understand the sudden drop in ranking between the past and the coming five years , nor the wide fluctuations in future ranking between different rounds .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
He also pointed out four challenges that the new millennium would bring to the financial market : the advance of information technology and the proliferation of internet applications ; the growing importance of institutional investors that caused fundamental changes to many aspects of the capital market ; the growing demand for cross-border financial transactions that has raised challenges for market regulators everywhere ; the emergence of a globalised market place that are linked by ever-expanding telecommunications technology which led to ever-growing cross-border financing activities .  
Internally , the Government will maintain the bedrock of its economic and trade policies , viz low taxes , free trade , free flow of information and the rule of law .  Building on such fundamental principles , we will keep upgrading our hardware ( infrastructure ) and software ( human resources and institutional framework ) in the continuous strive to sharpen our competitive edge and make perfect our business environment .  
Because the severely disabled and the elderly infirm were considered to have extra needs , the original objectives of the scheme were to give some financial help to the families concerned and to reduce demand for institutional care for these two groups .

For example , public rental estates with a high concentration of older people will be provided with integrated care services .  We will also organise more intergenerational activities in communities to help our elders enjoy healthy and active ageing .  
But we should never underestimate our strengths .  Our confidence stems from our distinct geographic advantage as well as the institutional assets we have developed over the years , including the rule of law , a free and open economy , a level playing field , an uncorrupt and efficient government and our enterprising people .  
The Government will strive to provide an institutional environment that is conducive to market development , in particular , to reinforce Hong Kong 's institutional strengths , such as the rule of law , a level playing field , clean government , free flow of information , a simple and low tax regime , and an efficient and effective market-regulatory system .

But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .

Services on organizational and institutional issues affecting national statistical services ; implementation of the 1993 System of National Accounts ; economic , social and demographic statistics ; electronic interchange and networking ; design and development of government information systems ; and technical and substantive support to the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific ;  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
The Special Unit for TCDC of UNDP has extensive experience in the field of technical cooperation in Africa with activities such as capacities and needs matching ( CNM ) , subject-specific workshops focusing on interactive exchange and consultations designed for sharing experiences and know-how , and development of an information referral system ( INRES ) , a data bank on developing countries ' institutional capacities accessible to all potential users .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
In the Mission 's view , the National Police 's key role in fighting impunity calls for sweeping reforms of its institutional bases and of the process used to select and train its officers , in order to correct its structural and professional weaknesses and to supply it with new resources .  
The broad spectrum of activities of the countries covered above shows that the strategic planning initiative is not one specific blueprint but more of an agenda , an institutional vision which helps to direct , monitor and track performance to stated goals and objectives .  
With regard to the institution-building process , it was said that despite the many daily problems and challenges , the institutional development should not be carried out on an ad hoc basis , but be seen in its local , regional and national dimensions , which required strategic thinking and vision .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
It is India 's considered view that before the Security Council embarks on any action to formally give itself a " role in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction " , all substantive , legal and institutional issues , including the role of specific treaty bodies , must be addressed and resolved through an open and transparent debate among the full membership of the United Nations .  
The operational and administrative procedures that the ministries use to conduct their day-to-day business need to be improved , and there needs to be ( a ) a degree of decentralization of decision-making to qualified managers and technical specialists ; ( b ) a building up of a professional civil service based on merit ; ( c ) an improvement in communication flows within the ministries ; and ( d ) a procedure for record-keeping in order to establish a solid foundation for institutional memory . 
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
The international community has recognized that sustaining a secure and stable environment is essential to promote the economic , social and institutional development necessary for a lasting restoration of democracy in Haiti .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
Their outcome must be accepted and respected by all parties , and supported by a strong institutional framework which must be shaped , sustained and strengthened on a continuing basis .  
Political will , a flexible and gradual approach , a favourable economic environment , the involvement of the private sector and relevant sectors of civil society , appropriate institutional and physical infrastructure as well as creative networking were among the factors contributing to such success .  
The Organization also stated that its activities directly addressed , inter alia , such issues raised in the programme for the third term of the Decade as the problem of ILO Conventions that had not achieved wide ratification , institutional means of action regarding the implementation of international labour standards , the ILO programme of work relevant to the progressive development of such standards and future trends in this regard in ILO 's specialized field .  
The Consultative Committee also published the outcome and proceedings of the special meeting on developing legal and institutional guidelines for privatization and post-privatization regulatory framework , held at Tokyo in January 1994 , which included the draft text of such guidelines .  
Paragraph 38 ( b ) of General Assembly resolution 47 / 199 specifically stated : " The United Nations system at the country level should be tailored , taking into account the views of the recipient Government , to the specific developmental needs of the country in such a way that they correspond to the ongoing and projected programmes rather than to the institutional structure of the United Nations " .  
Recent efforts in the multilateral clearing and payments arrangements have focused on reviewing their role and functions from a long-term perspective in view of the growing current account convertibility in developing economies and against the backdrop of major institutional changes taking place in major subregional and regional integration organizations .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
A seminar was held in Indonesia ( December 1994 ) which identified concrete opportunities for Asian-African cooperation in such areas as improved agricultural productivity , human capital formation and institutional development .  
Capital has become more mobile than ever across the world , owing to a combination of policies that encourage foreign investment in many developing economies with the rapid advance in computer-based telecommunication technology ; and the growth in the size of institutional investors ( mutual funds , pension funds , and so on ) .  
The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV / AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
ECA has reported that it is in consultation with UNDP at the country level regarding possible joint activities to identify , through national workshops in the five African small island developing States , ways to build human and institutional capacities , as well as a possible joint regional workshop on current priorities under the Programme of Action .  
Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the enhanced activities of the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) have ensured that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a constant of Central American political life .  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
However , integral reintegration ( social , productive , political , etc . ) was hampered by diverse factors , including the institutional weakness of the Government , insufficient coordination of resources and economic stagnation .  
Besides being designed to update the existing 1963 data ( all information gathered from the country 's most recent census in 1971 was destroyed in the 1972 earthquake ; attempts to prepare a census since 1980 were suspended due to conflict ) , the census had as a subsidiary objective the institutional strengthening of the INEC .  
Assistance to human resources development totalled $ 64-million , and included school feeding at the primary and secondary levels , technical and vocational training and institutional feeding in social centres .  
But a lot more needs to be learned : the numbers involved world wide , their geographical distribution , their precise needs , how they are being met and by whom , the status of the internally displaced in international law , and the adequacy of the coverage through existing international institutional arrangements for their protection and assistance .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
With the prospect of peace in sight , there was hope that the process of healing the wounds left by acts of unspeakable brutality could be successful if underpinned by firm institutional and legal guarantees and adequate rehabilitation efforts .  
the imbalance between the increasing responsibilities that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council had given that Branch and the institutional and financial means at its disposal could not be ignored , especially in the light of the growing crime rate , which was directly related to the tremendous corrupting power and the increasingly sophisticated methods of criminal organizations .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement , and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , to the problem of internal displacement ,  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
We are eager for greater efficiency and competitiveness in the public sector , for ongoing improvement in the provision of services , for excellence in public services , for the application of the most modern managerial techniques , for social marketing and for ethics in public service , which requires respect for such specific values as institutional loyalty and transparency of procedures .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
The heads of Government adopted a package of recommendations aimed at reducing the vulnerability of the region to the impact of natural occurrences , improving and expanding the region 's risk acceptance capacity , the development of strong and effective insurance regulation and regulatory capacity , and at strengthening the institutional base for national disaster mitigation , forecasting and assessment .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Caught between seeking its future and reconciling the present with its past , Africa must , with universal support , find modern institutional means of curbing the political tension that frequently results from tribalistic or clannish view of power , which in turn results in the civil wars that so hamper the continent in its march towards peace .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
Enhanced international technical assistance and advisory services can decisively strengthen national capacities and the institutional bases for supporting national plans and strategies that are designed to bring about sustained and sustainable social development .  
The mid-term review of the implementation of this important political pact highlights not only the great sacrifices made by the African countries in introducing both structural and institutional reforms and the efforts of the international community to support economic recovery and social development in Africa , but also the long road that remains to be travelled to attain the main objectives of the programme .  
We also fully agree with the idea that pursuing and deepening economic reforms and improving the physical and institutional infrastructure for the purpose of attracting further domestic and foreign direct investment are crucial .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
For decades , Central America has experienced repeated conflict and violence and has been afflicted by civil war and confrontation that left a well-known aftermath of social injustice , institutional fragility and economic disruption .  
The international community is aware that the Central American region is trying to lay to rest the painful process of internal conflict and is moving into a new stage of institutional and economic reconstruction .  
We are convinced that progress in the political and institutional areas in Central America can be consolidated only if they are accompanied by similar progress in economic development and by considerable reconstruction of the social fabric in those countries .  
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
We view with appreciation and hope the fact that this interaction between Guatemala 's experience and the respectful participation of Governments and multilateral institutions is yielding modest but valid solutions , enabling us to envisage a simple , competent and less bureaucratic form of institutional structures , and a kind of cooperation that does not undermine the precarious living conditions of the poor majorities in our countries and that contributes ideas and technical skills with due respect for our population .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .  
This is being achieved through the pursuit of a sound and stable macroeconomic policy , supported by a prudent and disciplined fiscal and monetary stance , and the delivery of an investor-friendly institutional legal framework .  
But what is more important in the institutional and mechanism frameworks is that the first special session gave the United Nations , and especially the General Assembly , its primary deliberative body , a key role to play in disarmament and greater responsibility in the process of seeking general and complete disarmament under effective international control .  
The operative part of the resolution called on Israel to respect the relevant resolutions of the Security Council , declared invalid all Israeli acts in the occupied Syrian Golan , called on Israel to desist from attempting to alter the physical , demographic , institutional and legal character of the occupied Syrian Golan , and referred to the issue of settlements in that territory .  
30 ECA , through its education and training programme in 1996 and 1997 , will continue to focus on developing and strengthening institutional , technical and human capabilities in the application of cartography and remote sensing techniques in data collection for natural resource and environmental management , while organizing expert meetings to enhance policies and design legislative guidelines for the use of cartography and remote sensing in social and economic planning ( see also paragraphs 129-131 below ) . 
Particularly relevant were : the country 's limited economic capacities , depending on farm production which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Other recommendations included the need to identify pivotal countries to serve as catalysts for promoting and implementing TCDC , the promotion of triangular cooperation arrangements under which donors agreed to fund exchanges among developing countries , the identification of subject-specific TCDC products , the expansion of TCDC-INRES into a multidimensional database , including information on several relevant centres of excellence , expert services and project experiences , as well as supporting the already existing institutional capacities in the developing countries .  
Particularly relevant were the country 's limited economic capacities and its dependence on farm production , which had only very recently begun to be modernized ; high rates of poverty and marginalization among the population ; the institutional and cultural consequences of the prolonged dictatorship ; and the existence of a very traditional and hierarchical society .  
Responding to questions raised by the Committee with respect to article 1 , she noted that exemptions from the principle of equality were based on objective criteria and precise rules formulated as laws following broad consultations with institutional and other partners .  Their purpose was to permit certain territorial adaptations in the organization of the principles recognized in the Constitution ; the principles themselves could not be changed .  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
However , the progress made towards establishing the institutional and physical infrastructure for the active involvement of the public and private sector in the economy , though notable , fell short of expectations , which appeared to have been overly optimistic .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
There is a need for a better coordinated institutional approach to provide comprehensive scientific , technical and economic assessments of the major human activities contributing to atmospheric modification .  
The project aims at identifying those criteria and indicators that can be considered objective , cost-effective and relevant in the assessment of the sustainability of prevailing forest management practices , taking into account parameters related to ecological , institutional , social and economic conditions and needs .  
A forest inventory report prepared by FAO shows that in most developing countries the existing institutional capacity is either inadequate or too weak to collect and update basic information on the area and type of forests , species composition , existing growing stock and volume of harvest .  
At the domestic level , civil strife and recurrent natural disasters in some of the least developed countries and the resulting social economic burdens , macroeconomic imbalances and poor performance of the productive sectors , inter alia the lack of adequate physical and institutional infrastructures , have contributed to this deterioration .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
The services feature advice and assistance to adjust the role of Governments to ensuring adequate competition , promoting new investment , achieving quality standards , meeting environmental and social requirements and enabling more active participation of the private sector in the industrialization process , including policy formulation and institutional support .  
In order to strengthen institutional capacity-building and human resource development in the public sector , developing countries and countries with economies in transition should avail themselves of the mechanisms of technical cooperation among developing countries and of triangular cooperation , in which developed countries and international organizations should play a catalytic role .  
Noting the progress made thus far by the representative of the Secretary-General in developing a legal framework , studying the causes and manifestations of internal displacement and analysing institutional arrangements , undertaking dialogue with Governments , issuing a series of reports on particular country situations together with proposals for remedial measures , and raising the level of awareness , at both the national and international levels , concerning the problem of internal displacement ,  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
The mission prepared a diagnostic study on the current socio-economic and political atmosphere for rural and urban micro-enterprises and on the current support being given to this sector by assistance agencies ; a set of recommendations for political , institutional and legal strategies for assistance and an operational approach to coordinating and harmonizing assistance ; and proposals for support programmes for access to credit and for the institutions supporting this sector .  
The United Nations system , the World Bank and International Finance Corporation ( IFC ) system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have continued to provide invaluable support in the formulation of national mineral sector policies , in the enhancement of legal and fiscal systems , in facilitating forums for multi-disciplinary dialogue and in the deepening of necessary institutional infrastructure .  
The United Nations system , World Bank and the IFC system and other multilateral and bilateral organizations have provided invaluable assistance to industry and host Governments in respect of mineral resource technical support and advice ; training of national staff in all skills required in mineral resource development ; hosting of regional promotional round-table forums to facilitate dialogue between industry , Government and facilitating organizations ; institutional structuring and reforms ; capacity building ; provision of research on trends in mineral , fiscal and legal policies ; and for commodity supply and demand studies .  
There is ample evidence that a weak bureaucracy , coupled with an ineffective judicial system , tends to generate an inefficient implementation of the formal institutional structure .  
The seminar , which will take place at Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan , from 10 to 12 June 1996 , will deal with the following issues : national reports on drugs and organized crime , including a review of existing legislative and institutional frameworks for prevention and control ; impact of drugs and organized crime on security , democracy and economic reform ; prevention and control of corruption ; money-laundering ; legal and institutional reform ; and regional and international cooperation : conclusions and recommendations .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
Stressing the importance of an efficient and effective public sector as the basic framework for stable and sustainable institutional and human development in all countries ,  
96 Paragraph 233 ( d ) calls upon Governments and non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and other institutional organizations , to include , as appropriate , " information about international and regional instruments and standards in their public information and human rights education activities and in adult education and training programmes , particularly for groups such as the military , the police and other law enforcement personnel , the judiciary , and legal and health professionals to ensure that human rights are effectively protected " .  
Typically , such a process should include ( i ) assessing the hydroclimatic , hydrographic and demographic conditions ; ( ii ) establishing water management objectives ; ( iii ) formulating and evaluating alternative resource management actions , implementation tools and institutional arrangements ; ( iv ) assessing the impacts of promising alternatives ; and ( v ) choosing and implementing the preferred course of action .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
The foreseeable developments in the international context - economic , political and institutional - following the Uruguay Round and the advance of regional and subregional integration agreements can offer some opportunities for countries whose productive and export-driven development has been retarded ; nevertheless , they also entail a significant erosion of the opportunities for implementing selective policies to promote such development .  
The fourth objective is to promote the establishment of regional institutional mechanisms to guarantee the full collaboration and participation of women in the main spheres of economic , political and social development .  
Within the context of this 20 / 20 initiative , the meeting understood basic social services as comprising basic education and primary health care , including reproductive health and population programmes , nutrition programmes and safe drinking water and sanitation , as well as the institutional capacity for delivering those services .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
To strengthen the institutional capacity of Governments and communities for the development , utilization and commercialization of new and renewable energy sources ; to develop national and indigenous capacity in assessment and management of energy resources and services ; to introduce changes in energy consumption patterns , focusing on conservation measures and demand-side management ; to facilitate international and interregional connections for the transmission of electric power and transport of natural gas ; and to promote technology transfer to different levels of government , civil society , community institutions and entrepreneurs .  
In relation to natural resources and energy , it focused on addressing issues of institutional management , defining the roles of the State , particularly in regard to privatization and regulation , contributing to the design and application of public policies for integrated natural resources management and providing support for the regional implementation of international environmental agreements that relate to natural resource management .  
A more systematic and sustained process of building and nurturing national human and institutional capacities is required , tailored to each country 's strengths and weaknesses , to help integrate the different dimensions of development , including that of economic and social rights , and to design , manage and execute complex programmes and projects .  
The project foresees technical assistance from UNCTAD , primarily in the establishment of institutional , operational and managerial capacities , and the necessary legal framework for the proper setting up and functioning of the port .  
In 1995 , in close collaboration with the Palestinian Authority , the Programme prepared the project entitled " Multi-sectoral drug control assistance to the Palestinian Authority " , which will provide technical assistance ( a ) to establish a drug control institutional framework ; ( b ) to reduce the illicit supply of narcotic drugs through improved detection , interdiction and prosecution capacities ; and ( c ) to prevent and reduce drug abuse through improved awareness , treatment and rehabilitation methods .  
The major features of the strategy are to support private sector farming activities through improved legal , regulatory and institutional frameworks , to enhance the efficiency of traditional and domestic market-oriented agriculture , to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of intensive and export-oriented agriculture and to improve access to regional and international markets .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
Adopt measures , prior to the signing of the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace , and without detriment to the legal dissolution of the voluntary civil defence committees , to eradicate and put a stop to the establishment of organizations of varying names and origins , including some of those established to replace disbanded voluntary civil defence committees , which carry out State functions , such as security or public order , outside the institutional framework of the State .  
Adopt , within its sphere of competence , a set of measures to enable the Public Prosecutor 's Office to play the role assigned to it , with a view to : ( i ) establishing hierarchical supervision over the National Police and other security forces ; ( ii ) preventing interference from other State entities in the Office 's work ; ( iii ) providing the necessary institutional support to prosecutors who are responsible for cases involving human rights violations ; and ( iv ) protecting the physical integrity of the Office 's personnel ;  
The FAO Committee on Fisheries in March 1995 endorsed the creation of a Fisheries Technical Assistance Programme for small island developing States , focusing on the following priority areas , as identified by countries : institutional strengthening and capacity-building ; conservation and management of fisheries in the exclusive economic zone ; improved post-harvest management and marketing ; safety at sea ; strengthening the economic role of national fisheries industries ; and aquaculture and inland fisheries conservation and management .  
At national , subnational and local levels capacity-building is a key objective for several reasons : ( a ) forest management action is effected at these levels , ( b ) many countries do not have the institutional capacity to design and to implement strategies for the management of their forest resources , and ( c ) FAO and other international organizations concerned depend for their data collection on information that countries have already collected for their own purposes .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
This is a sign that confidence in at least the medium run is being restored and that key institutional reforms , as well as a reasonable degree of macroeconomic and political stability , are being attained .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
To urge donors and international organizations to support the establishment of regional and national institutional systems dedicated to undertaking systematic studies on TFRK and to promote its wide understanding and use .  
The greatest pay-off in terms of increases in efficiency and lowered real costs of transport is likely to come about from a full-scale effort to improve a whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory , managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods to and from markets in the region or abroad .  
It called for an effective regional institutional mechanism to provide for a harmonized approach to transit transport matters , and it urged all concerned international and regional organizations to strengthen their activities which promoted regionally adopted legal and administrative solutions that facilitated regional and international transport and trade .  
The basic NFP principles recognize the following key elements ( see document E / CN . 17 / IPF / 1996 / 8 ) : national sovereignty ; integration with a country 's sustainable development strategy ; partnership ; participation ; a holistic and intersectoral approach ; a long-term iterative process ; capacity-building ; policy and institutional reforms ; consistency with national policy frameworks and global initiatives ; awareness-raising ; and harmony with national and international commitments .  
None of the existing international legal instruments , as they currently stand , may have the potential to fully ensure a coordinated approach in international policy , financial issues and integration at the institutional level regarding forests and forest-related activities .  
The programme is designed to improve urban living conditions and strengthen municipal institutional capacities for the planning and operation of urban facilities and public services , including water supply and solid waste management .  
It requested the Secretary-General to report to the Assembly at its fifty-first session on further institutional developments related to the strengthening of international organizations in the area of multilateral trade and , in preparing that report , to solicit the views of all Governments , competent regional economic integration organizations and the executive heads of the competent specialized agencies and of other organizations and programmes of the United Nations system on this matter . 
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
Difficulties developed and delays again occurred in a number of areas , including the institutional consolidation of the public security sector ; the adoption of legal and constitutional reforms ; the reform of the judicial and electoral systems ; the transfer of land to former combatants ; and the transfer of rural human settlements to their current occupants .  
implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Furthermore , the provisions of the resolution should be taken fully into account and implemented in a comprehensive and integrated manner , comprising all the necessary elements at the national and international levels , particularly those related to technology transfer , financial resources and enabling international economic environment through new initiatives for strengthening institutional capacity for enhancing international development cooperation .  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
The project will assist Governments and regional institutions in strengthening capability for monitoring and analysing climate and sea level trends ; identify areas vulnerable to the effects of climate change and sea level rise ; develop an integrated management and planning framework ; enhance regional and national capabilities through human resource development and institutional strengthening ; identify and assess policy operations and instruments ; and collect information for preparing national communications .  
Much of sub-Saharan Africa suffers from severe shortages of technical , managerial and entrepreneurial skills , acute infrastructure bottlenecks , weak institutional capabilities , severe limitations in the capacity to import , and continued dependence on exports of a few primary commodities .  
With financial support from Germany , preparatory work is already under way on a high-impact programme for entrepreneurship development among women , under which 10 national programmes will be elaborated , each aimed at releasing the principal technical , managerial , financial , institutional and policy constraints affecting the development of women 's entrepreneurship .  
International strategies of cooperation and coordination are outlined in the Habitat Agenda , chapter IV , section E . The main strategic objectives and activities presented in that section cover the establishment of an international enabling environment ; issues of international finance , external debt and trade ; the promotion of the transfer of technology and exchange of information ; and the provision of support to technical and institutional cooperation .  
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
It will be recalled that , following the first United Nations Conference on Human Settlements , held in Vancouver , British Columbia , in 1976 , and deriving from its recommendations , a consensus developed on the need for institutional arrangements to provide a focal point within the United Nations system to promote and support a concerted and systematic effort by the international community for human settlements development .  
Section I contains information on the subsidiary bodies of the Economic and Social Council , which have been grouped , on the basis of their institutional status , into six categories : ( a ) functional commissions , ( b ) regional commissions , ( c ) standing committees , ( d ) expert bodies composed of governmental experts , ( e ) expert bodies composed of members serving in their personal capacity and ( f ) related bodies .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
For example , many countries have reported initiatives which have been taken in fields as diverse as information activities and awareness-building among different categories of actors ; creation of the institutional tools required for the follow-up of proposed activities ; and preparation for national forums by , inter alia , organizing the first decentralized consultations , conducting a number of thematic studies and strengthening the consultative processes aimed at the signing of joint venture agreements .  
A growing need for effective and timely measures to address urgent water problems that are often directly or indirectly related to agricultural water uses , such as water scarcity and environmental degradation , has increased the demands for improved decision-making , clear water policies , and adequate legal and institutional frameworks at the national level .  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .  
From the institutional standpoint , many different reforms have been introduced in order to restructure the scientific research sector as a means of improving its performance , developing scientific knowledge and facilitating its applications in the economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The Tunisian Government is convinced that scientific and technological progress constitutes a fundamental right of Tunisians and it intends by these institutional measures to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the national research system in order to promote rapid development of science and technology and their dissemination throughout Tunisia 's society and economy , thus binding Tunisia firmly to the world economy and preventing its marginalization from universal progress . 
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
Technical support and cooperation are provided in order to yield concrete results , with special attention being devoted to human resource development and institution-building designed to contribute better to the efforts of recipient countries to create an overall enabling environment at a policy and institutional level .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
For these countries , the main issue is how to speed up the creation of supply capacity through the mobilization of adequate resources , both domestic and foreign , for the development of productive capacity ( physical , human and institutional ) , a necessary first step towards building up export capabilities .  
Such work may also require international support for related activities at the national level , including technical cooperation activities to strengthen national policy and institutional instruments , and the domestic capabilities needed for this purpose , in the specific areas concerned . 
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
The representative of Ireland , speaking for the European Union , pointed out that , although the last few years had seen an extraordinary increase in FDI flows to developing countries , there were still countries where FDI was excluded from certain sectors of the economy or where inflows were inhibited due to shortcomings in the political , economic and institutional environment and a legacy of distrust towards FDI .  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
Other issues that must be addressed included the problems faced by developing countries , particularly those in Africa , concerning access to markets , capital and technology , unfavourable institutional arrangements and inadequate capacity for their meaningful integration into the world economy .  
Their major expected results are : the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks , of commercially viable reforms and instruments to foster efficient trade and transport operations ( with direct and active participation of concerned public and private agencies and operative Trade Points , and through National Trade and Transport Facilitation Committees representing all functional interests ) ; and the establishment of adequate training programmes .  
Special attention will be paid to measures designed to improve the whole range of institutional , procedural , regulatory managerial and other non-physical aspects of vital importance to the actual movement of goods .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  We believe , however , that it is crucial for the international community to provide these new institutions with sufficient resources to enable them to discharge their important functions .  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
His delegation was also encouraged by regional activities designed to implement Agenda 21 and by the fact that , at the national level , approximately 100 countries had reformed their institutional structures with a view to achieving sustainable development .  
Despite the economic and technological difficulties it faced , Colombia had introduced sweeping legislative , institutional and administrative reforms for environmental protection .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management ; the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management to effectively utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
Also important is the fact that the United Nations Charter , which might be called an institutional pillar of the Organization , is a highly balanced document , free of any visible bias in one direction or another , and this has allowed it to become , one might say , a code of modern international relations that no civilized State has any right to ignore .  
The European Union , wishing to respond to the challenges of the post-cold-war world , proposes to take up three major challenges over the years ahead : the establishment of an economic and monetary union ; the strengthening of its institutional base through the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty ; and preparation for further enlargement towards the eastern and southern Europe .  
Mr . Thiebaud ( France ) ( interpretation from French ) : The General Assembly is being asked today to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti ( MICIVIH ) to 31 December 1998 , in response to the wishes expressed by President Ren Pr � al in his letter dated 10 November 1997 to the Secretary-General , in which he requested the continued support of that Mission to carry out the institutional consolidation that is essential for a state of law and for the deepening of the democratic process in Haiti .  
The conditions that prevailed prior to the establishment of the zones included , inter alia , peaceful relations and mutual confidence , economic cooperation and a general belief in the enhancement of common interests through institutional regional frameworks .  
In the past five years , in line with this policy , Colombia has set up a regulatory and institutional framework , ranging from the establishment of the Ministry for the Environment to the creation of an environmental network enabling the authorities and the community to take part in the national and local decision-making process relating to the environment .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
Whereas the Constitution in force since 1986 sets forth the responsibility of the State , as the expression of the legal and political organization of society , for promoting the common good and the consolidation of the rule of legality , security , justice , equality , freedom and peace , and defines as a central concern the promotion of the full enjoyment of human rights within a stable , permanent and popular institutional order in which governed and government act with absolute adherence to the law ,  
Whereas the above-mentioned reforms also systematize and develop the spirit and the letter of the commitments signed on institutional , political , economic , social and ethnic issues , on human rights and their strict observance and on efforts to combat impunity ,  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
Until waste management authorities overcome these institutional shortcomings and develop a more flexible management structure , responsive to the needs of public , private and community sectors , isolated schemes will remain good examples of " best practice demonstrations " and will not be incorporated into the overall waste management system .  
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .  The representative of the National Observatory for Human Rights of Algeria advised that the Observatory was based on the principle of institutional and cultural pluralism .  
This national undertaking calls for an implementation strategy that sets realistic priorities for gradual fulfilment of the various aspects of the Peace Agreements as and when the political , institutional , financial and technical bases for their implementation are established ,  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
This should include appropriate delegation of authority , enhancement of the capacity of the staff through training and the provision of a stable resource base to ensure the continuous presence of an institutional critical mass .  A first step in that direction would be for Headquarters to provide urgent assistance by assigning to Nairobi for one month a senior administrator with proven experience in the establishment and functioning of United Nations common services outputs ( SP-96-001-19 ) .  
This programme is designed to enhance effective and efficient management capacities for the public and private sectors in the context of a market economy and a democratic society ; and initiate a programme of support to the Palestinian Authority in the area of governance and public administration with the overall aim of strengthening and improving its institutional capacity .  
The exercise will involve mapping poverty at district and subdistrict levels through an in-depth participatory poverty assessment survey nationwide ; the preparation of national guidelines for community involvement in development activities ; training and institutional strengthening for intersectoral coordination and articulation between central and local governments ; and revamping of the country 's poverty monitoring system for use in decentralized policy and programme evaluation on a continuous basis .  
That was how the transitional institutional order was established ; its main purpose is to indicate the way to the Third Republic by creating attitudes consistent with the democratic imperative of a State governed by rule of law , by instituting major political , economic , social , legal and cultural reforms with a view to creating an environment conducive to the establishment of a democratic State governed by the rule of law and by holding free , transparent and democratic elections from which no one would be excluded .  
FLNKS believes that the local partners in the Matignon Accords should also be in a position to resume bilateral discussions on the country 's institutional future before the whole range of political groups , social and professional categories , and traditional institutions is associated with the approach advocated by FLNKS .  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
There is a need for a broad spectrum of quantitative , qualitative and descriptive indicators covering social , cultural , economic , ecological , institutional , legal and policy elements , including land tenure .  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
In part , this would be due to rising income and per capita consumption , overall export growth , moderate inflation and modest current account deficits projected for South , East and South-East Asian countries . 6 To some extent , it can be anticipated that there will be a further intensification of regional cooperation within the various institutional arrangements currently in existence .  
It is against this background of societies repeatedly traumatized by economic , social , cultural and other factors that such extreme situations develop , in which the breakdown of the institutional order opens the floodgates to widespread violence and massacres of the civilian population , frequently leading in the end to actual genocide .  
In such cases , it is also common for the majority of the members of the judiciary to be removed from office and for the ordinary courts to be replaced by military courts to try people for alleged political offences , culminating in a Supreme Court of Justice that legalizes institutional acts or their equivalent , or confers a supra _ constitutional status on emergency rules adopted by the regime .  
After extended discussions during which the relevant institutional and political actors sought to identify potential solutions to this problem , the Government decided to promulgate a decree establishing a temporary legal mechanism which would extend special documentation facilitating access to pension benefits .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
The planning and implementation of national reconstruction and development have continued during the period under review in accordance with the national objectives and following the strategic options taken by the Government a few years ago : development of basic infrastructure and public services infrastructure ; creation and strengthening of legal frameworks , in particular for private sector development ; and rehabilitation and development of institutional frameworks .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The vulnerability of the Palestinian economy to the interaction of such factors has been compounded by a range of inherent weaknesses coupled with the absence of an adequate regulatory and institutional framework at the public and private sector levels .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
We are all aware that the Government and people of Haiti bear the principal responsibility for the political , economic , social and institutional reconstruction of the country , but we also know that , if long-term peace and stability are to be attained , it is indispensable that the international community make a sustained commitment to cooperation .  That is why we are present here today .  
Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
The Assembly also stressed that , in the light of the ongoing discussions on reform within the United Nations , international institutional arrangements in the area of sustainable development were intended to contribute to the goal of strengthening the entire United Nations system .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
In line with the objectives of the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa , the international community and the United Nations system must strengthen industrial development cooperation for African industrialization in the areas of industrial policy , investment , transfer of technology , institutional and human resource development , and the development of small - and medium-scale industry .  Support was also required for the promotion of regional and sub-regional cooperation as a practical means of enlarging markets and establishing multinational projects .  
The draft resolution was essentially a procedural document dealing with institutional links between the United Nations and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the necessary financial support , but listed in its preambular part the main events that had occurred during the year pursuant to the Convention , which was of crucial importance to many developing countries . 
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
Together with the agenda of social , economic and other reforms contained in the Alliance for Sustainable Development , the existing dynamic institutional framework within which these reforms may now be implemented and the support of the international community , including the United Nations system itself , these circumstances place the countries of Central America in a favourable position to pursue economic growth , social justice and further democratization .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Successful enterprise development is affected by a conducive economic environment in terms of the macroeconomic , regulatory and legal frameworks , the structural characteristics of the national economy , the degree of market development , the institutional framework , the infrastructural and human resource base and the quality and coherence of government policies .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
Besides promoting a dynamic and competitive domestic economy , based on comparative advantages , and providing physical and institutional infrastructures , domestic sectoral policies should also seek to integrate the protection and conservation of the environment and the achievement of social development objectives into sectoral development plans .  
These include the articulation of clear development goals , strategies and priorities that are nationally prescribed and supported , where necessary , by external partners ; effective performance of functions through a well-trained human resource base ; competent organizations and management effectively to utilize and retain skilled people ; a policy and institutional environment that can facilitate the performance and accountability of the public sector and other national institutions ; and sensitivity to the overall social , economic and cultural environment in which capacity development is to take place .  
The present legal and institutional framework through which legislative , executive and judicial powers continued to be exercised in Myanmar was not in conformity with established international norms governing human rights .  
This structured programme of technical cooperation in the field of human rights involves the principal elements of the administration of justice and legal reform ; penitentiary administration ; training and institutional support ; and genocide response and vulnerable groups .  
However , these improvements would remain transitory and frail unless accompanied by policies at both the national and the international levels favourable to strong institutional and technological capacity-building .  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
These existing arrangements demonstrate the feasibility of international and regional agreements to practical institutional arrangements , which could have wider application for the sustained monitoring of continuing natural hazard risks .  
Specialized knowledge and various organizational mandates have created gaps or unclear delineations of responsibility in current institutional abilities to address adequately early warning for technological hazards and issues of severe environmental degradation .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
This deepened understanding of the problem of internal displacement and of the existing international normative and institutional frameworks through which it is addressed has significantly enhanced the prospects of effective response to the needs of the internally displaced .  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Also stresses in this context the need for various measures to be taken by the international community , including increased trade-related technical assistance and human and institutional capacity-building for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services of developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , with a view to their full integration into the world economy ;  
In most cases , however , the growth processes remain fragile and the outlook is surrounded by considerable uncertainty . 4 While high inflation rates have been largely reduced to more manageable levels , prices still do not guide economic activity to the degree common in most market economies , as enterprise governance and institutional frameworks for business decision-making are still in transition . 
To that end , the Government is strongly encouraged to consider taking appropriate steps to develop a legal and institutional framework for public broadcasting to ensure that the State-financed broadcasting media can operate effectively as a public service broadcaster , with full guarantees of editorial and operational independence from Government and all other political influence on programming content .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
From this standpoint , the countries that are weakest in terms of economic , institutional , material and technological capacity are the most vulnerable developing countries in general and African countries in particular because the automatic effect of the activities of developed countries to prevent and combat organized crime is to condemn such countries to becoming new zones of expansion .  
We must therefore urgently find an effective response to this threat by defining a common objective based on a united stand and coherent action , by establishing or strengthening cooperation for exchanging experience and knowledge , by increasing our exchange of information and , above all , by actively promoting and supporting cooperation with international or regional forums so as to provide institutional technical assistance and logistical support .

The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .

A set of legal , institutional , managerial and procedural measures for follow-up have been outlined , including developing the technical capabilities of officials involved in the formulation of insurance policy and determination of premiums and their allocation . 
In assisting the PA to develop institutional and managerial capacities essential to sound policy-making , UNCTADs assistance to the Palestinian people also helps to enable Palestine to emerge as a distinct actor in the regional and global economic arenas .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
There needs to be a deepening of domestic capital markets , within an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and with the development of a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
The focus on human rights standards is further reflected in the technical assistance provided to Governments and in the strengthening of the institutional and legal environment ; in the drafting of new constitutions ; the reform of civil and penal laws and the establishment or rehabilitation of juvenile courts .  
On this basis , I am confident that an appropriate mechanism will be found to meet the aspirations of the Government of Haiti as well as the desire of the international community to elaborate a long-term , coordinated and well-managed plan for Haiti 's sustainable social , economic and institutional development .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on many fronts , notably , improvement of physical factors as regards inadequate infrastructure as well as trade balances , transport systems , better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations was lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
States in the region demonstrated their growing recognition that refugee problems need to be addressed through the creation of effective legislative and institutional frameworks that are consistent with international standards .  
The progressive narrowing of existing gaps between operational measures and corresponding enabling legislation and institutional frameworks is also being addressed through pilot border-management programmes that target the operational strengthening of immigration control as a practical means of bridging these gaps .  
The project will lead to the development or harmonization of relevant legal instruments and to improved coordination among the concerned institutions and , based on an analysis of the institutional capacity to respond to that form of crime , will contribute to the development of a national strategy and elements of a subregional strategy against trafficking in human beings .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
Within its current severe financial and staffing constraints , the Institute has been able to implement a modest but promising substantive programme of work , thus demonstrating its institutional potential and proving its capability to fulfil its unique role in pursuit of the advancement of women and gender equality .  
She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
He stated that the basic problem of landlocked developing countries , long recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations , was the lack of territorial access to the sea , aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets and by the prohibitive transport costs associated with an inadequate infrastructure , as well as trade imbalances , inefficient transport systems , poor utilization of assets and weak managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
It has established regular meetings with the Ministers of Justice in both entities to ensure that political , technical and institutional impediments to the proper functioning of the judiciary are being positively addressed .  
The independent expert encourages all the actors involved to pursue the political dialogue that they have already begun , but he can not insist enough on the current priority : the holding of free , democratic and transparent elections , without which it will be impossible to ensure the institutional stability that is essential if the innumerable challenges facing the Government and people of Haiti are to be met . 
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Three in particular stand out : the return to stability and growth has not been the result of a unique formula ; the severe economic and social consequences of the crisis have highlighted the need to strengthen institutional structures at the international and national levels ; and corrective domestic policies have to be complemented by resolute international support measures .  
On a broader front , meaningful partnership requires more inclusive and democratic institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making which would ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
It agreed on the need for good governance , an efficient administrative and institutional support structure , adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors ( A / 54 / 316 , para .  44 ) .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
In furtherance of the aims of the World Programme of Action concerning disabled persons , ILO was seeking to equalize employment opportunities for persons with disabilities , by advising member States on developing appropriate legislative and institutional frameworks based on its Conventions , building a supportive environment for the social and economic integration of disabled persons , as well as a code of practice on managing disability and related matters in the workplace .  
In particular , small island developing States such as Fiji could not receive an equitable share of the benefits of the global trading system without improved market access , special and differential treatment of their products and enhanced institutional capacity to make the most of global trading opportunities .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security , often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
In keeping with that commitment , the countries of the Central American Group had established the legal and institutional framework for social development based on the principles of mutual cooperation , solidarity and realization of the full potential of men and women in the region as well as on overcoming the structural factors that gave rise to poverty in the subregion .  
Solutions to those complex environmental challenges required differentiated approaches that would place enormous demands on policy design and implementation at all levels and would require solid and concerted institutional responses .  
In addition , WIPO had established a specific institutional mechanism , the Worldwide Academy , which was dedicated to optimizing the use of intellectual property systems by enhancing human resources development programmes at the national and regional levels .  
Mr . Christian Tomuschat , the Commissions Coordinator , detailed its main conclusions and recommendations the fruit of a year and a half of work on the human rights violations and acts of violence which occurred during the internal armed conflict .  In its conclusions , the Commission stated that at least 83 per cent of the victims were Mayan and attributed institutional responsibility for 93 per cent of the violations to agents of the State , principally members of the army .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
MICIVIH currently has responsibility for providing institutional assistance ( with particular reference to the police , judiciary , the penal system , the Ombudsmans Office and civil society organizations ) , supporting the promotion and protection of human rights and verifying observance of individual rights , fundamental freedoms and due process requirements .  
They should promote greater institutional convergence between developed and developing countries and assist the latter to establish the physical infrastructure necessary for their economic and social development , including by supporting social safety nets to protect the socially vulnerable and those marginalized by globalization and providing access to basic education , health and good drinking water .  
The WTO ( like other global governance institutions ) exists because the more sophisticated , internationalist currents in the leadership ( including both politicians and corporate managers ) of the United States and other developed countries realized that a global market requires a complex set of institutional underpinnings .  
This segment of the conservative political elite is completely supportive of free markets , but has little appreciation of the institutional infrastructure necessary to make such markets work , particularly at the global level .  
The Registrys requirements for contractual services are estimated at $ 19,649,200 , reflecting an increase of $ 1,005,900 , owing to the revised detainee service agreements , the commencement of French verbatim reporting by an institutional contractor and increased requirements for contractual translation to meet urgent requirements caused by trial and appeal activities ( see A / 54 / 518 , para .  54 ) .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
I , General legislative and institutional framework , para . 25 ) , one of the initial steps that should be taken by the Government in relation to a proposed infrastructure project is to conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility .  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
A continuing debate on institutional issues was essential in order to promote a stable and equitable international financial system that was supportive of long-term development .  
Adequate and timely information on the macroeconomic situation in different parts of the world was essential for early warning efforts , and sound macroeconomic policies to strengthen institutional capacity and regulatory frameworks , as well as domestic banking systems , were also essential .  
The creation of socialist systems appeared as a gigantic experiment in organizational and institutional innovation that met with significant initial success in achieving some important development targets set by communist regimes ( other objectives , like consumption increases or popular participation having early been deliberately sacrificed or postponed ) .  
A kind of systemic lock-in made itself increasingly felt , owing to the coherence of the classical system ( Kornai , 1992 ) and to the strong restraints set by the institutional base ( mono-party communist regime combined with domination of State ownership ) on genuine technological , organizational and institutional adaptive change .  
In these trajectories , interdependent phenomena of political change , institutional shift , macroeconomic trends and social tendencies have generally reinforced each other and produced specific configuration of cumulative causation processes .  
The diversity of national and regional paths of change , leading to a significant variety of post-socialist emerging capitalisms ( Magnin , 1999 ) , illustrates the role of idiosyncratic and evolving institutional configurations that represent the very content of systemic change .  
The Chinese trajectory , however , where these factors are absent , also points to the decisive role of State capacity in the virtuous growth path that accompanied gradual and uneven institutional reforms over a period of two decades ( as exemplified in the agricultural reforms , the open-door policy , the transitional dual-track regime in industry and the change in the fiscal system Chavance , forthcoming in 2000 ) .  
The change of rules in general institutional and organizational rules , constitutional and ordinary rules , and formal and informal rules represents the essential content of systemic change , hence the decisive role of law and the State in the process . 
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , including through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
The Secretary-Generals 1997 report , entitled Renewing the United Nations : a programme for reform , had stated that success required that the United Nations devise effective means by which to collaborate with other international organizations and institutions of civil society , thereby amplifying the impact of its own moral , institutional and material resources ( see A 51-950 , para . 22 ) , and thus reflected what was already to a large extent the reality of the current situation .  
There is no doubt that this report assumes special importance at a time when we are experiencing an increasing need to deepen and enhance cooperation between the two organizations in development , social , economic , military , political , diplomatic and other fields , all of which aim at serving the common interests of the African continent in general , and at upgrading the structure and institutional capacities of the OAU , in particular . 
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
In the social and economic fields , the United Nations plays a unique role in the development process on the African continent by continuously supporting the building of the OAUs institutional capacities to promote regional economic integration of the States of Africa and to enhance the continents ability to take advantage of international and bilateral initiatives to promote development .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
Create and or encourage the creation and strengthening of institutional mechanisms at all levels , including taking all measures to ensure that national machineries as well as focal points within specific institutions are not marginalized in the administrative structure but supported at the highest possible level of government and entrusted with clearly defined mandates which define their function as a policy advisory body ;  
The objectives of these conferences were to improve the scientific understanding of and the ability to predict the environmental and societal impacts of the phenomena , and to define improved operational and institutional approaches to reducing damage from future occurrences .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
Such policies should be complemented by other measures for promoting efficient and clean energy that take into account the widely differing institutional , social , economic , technical and natural resource endowment in individual countries and regions .  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
In effect , the creation of secondary markets in mortgages is a subject to which increasing attention is being paid in the housing finance sector in the Latin American countries , where strong legislative , institutional and enabling initiatives are being taken towards that end.Indeed , various Latin American countries have been implementing or enhancing this mechanism .  
Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
Currently , very few if any renewable energy sources are being developed on a commercial basis in small island developing States , and if the increased use of solar PV systems continues to depend on public funding and external assistance , effective institutional approaches must be developed . 
The development of renewable energy sources will depend not only on the choice of appropriate technology but also on adequate development of managerial and technical expertise , careful financial management and adoption of appropriate institutional approaches .  
For small loads typical of rural households in remote areas with sufficient insolation , solar PV systems are proving to be economically and technically successful , when complemented by an institutional approach , including financial arrangements , that provides for the installation of the systems and maintenance on a fee-for-service basis .  
A number of small island developing States have not yet accorded high priority to institution - and capacity-building ; some of them have had to deal with more pressing problems such as natural disasters and macroeconomic imbalances ; the recent economic crisis has had direct impact on some small island developing States where deteriorations in economic performance have further reduced scope for action for institutional and administrative capacity-building ;  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time _ frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
From a legislative perspective , it is important to devise institutional arrangements for the regulatory functions which ensure to the regulatory body an adequate level of efficiency , taking into account the political , legal and administrative tradition of the country .  
Thus , since 1995 , INDAP has explicitly mainstreamed a gender perspective in its regular institutional activities , meaning that a cross-cutting approach will be taken to each of its activities and measures , based on the recognition of rural families as a basic unit of the production process , with different requirements according to their composition and specific members ( men , women , young people , older persons , relatives , etc . ) .  
The more flexible and efficient work methods required by a closer association with private-sector and NGO partners will accelerate current efforts to modernize and adapt UNCTADs institutional and managerial culture to the realities of economic development , thus complementing recent structural changes in the organization .  
Since the sixth session of the Commission , a functioning prototype of the system has been developed , consisting of a revised international site and a demonstration national node , and mock-ups of regional and institutional nodes .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
An estimated amount of $ 152 , 000 , at the maintenance level , would be required for official travel of the staff of the Division to participate in global , regional , subregional and national conferences , meetings , seminars and symposia that call for coordination and the Divisions input for statistical development ; to assist Member States in institutional development in statistics ; and to ensure collaboration and liaison with the regional commissions on matters relating to statistical development .  
In this context , the programme will deal with electoral mechanisms and processes , parliaments and other representative bodies , institutional machinery designed to facilitate participation in the elaboration , implementation , monitoring and evaluation of public policies , management of diversity and consensus-building , judicial systems , legal and regulatory framework and establishing conditions of predictability about where businesses can operate productively and experience innovative growth .

This relates to issues of access where the potential of HDI projects is restricted by the physical deficiencies of infrastructure and the critical role played by access to and from villages in meeting HDI objectives ; the institutional arrangements under which HDI projects operates because of its special mandate ; and the short time-frame of two and a half years for the duration of HDI projects as compared to the normal UNDP country cooperation framework .  
Where BDS are strategically important but not yet adapted to local needs , joint efforts by public and private institutions have proven effective institutional responses .  
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
While control over the regulation of all aspects of the production and supply of drugs and psychotropic substances had been tightened in health care and scientific institutions and in the chemical industry , severely weakened institutional accountability , as well as an underdeveloped system for formulating and implementing regulations impeded control and oversight .  
Moreover , the essential prerequisites for the development of competitive service exports , such as adequate human resources , financing and technology , and an appropriate infrastructural , institutional , policy and regulatory framework , were lacking in most developing countries .  
To deal with the volatility of capital flows , developing countries needed to deepen domestic capital markets , institute an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework and develop a strong domestic institutional investor base .

Stresses the importance , at the national level , of maintaining sound macroeconomic policies and developing effective institutional and regulatory frameworks and human resources , so as to realize the mutually reinforcing objectives of poverty eradication and development , inter alia through national poverty reduction strategies and enhanced policy coherence ;  
This can be attained only through generous financial assistance from the industrialized world directed towards improving and enhancing weak infrastructures and augmenting national institutional capacities .  
However , the view was expressed that statutory language by itself was not sufficient to establish a functioning insolvency regime ; what was required was a strong institutional structure that was both accountable and transparent .  
While there was no single model to resolve the problem of underdevelopment , international cooperation was increasingly necessary for the strengthening and sharing of the human , institutional , economic and technical capacities of States .  
This new framework is a holistic and integrated approach to development strategies and programs that highlights the interdependence of all aspects of development strategy : social , human , institutional , environmental , economic and financial .  
Such partnership requires more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decisionmaking so as to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis .  
While convincing results have been achieved in building institutional memory in specific substantive subject areas , such repositories of knowledge remain compartmentalized , with crosscutting access either difficult or nonexistent .  
Inadequate budgetary allocations for the social sectors , slow disbursement of available funds , weak institutional and human resources capacities , and unreasonably low salary levels for civil servants are constraints common to all sectors .  
Governments need to develop a suitable legal and institutional environment to facilitate active partnerships with the private sector in a manner that ensures the provision of services to the urban and rural poor .  
In close coordination with local and national authorities , steps to promote social and institutional advances can help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
Mobilizing the skills and other resources of diverse global actors , therefore , may increasingly involve forming loose and temporary global policy networks that cut across national , institutional and disciplinary lines .  
There is however no easy fix for the institutional impediments in many developing countries , above all unsupportive regulatory environments and exorbitant charges imposed by national authorities .  
UNDP will work in close coordination with local and national authorities to take steps to promote social and institutional advances to help to keep preexisting tensions from developing into violent conflict .  
The objective is to enable African countries to achieve economic and social development through accelerated human and institutional capacity development as well as agricultural and private sector development .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
Reference should be made , for instance , to how the legal and institutional frameworks are geared to supporting or hindering private domestic and foreign investments .  
The establishment of pluralistic democracy has led to profound changes , both at the level of the legal and institutional environment and at the economic , social and cultural level .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
With the increased flow of private capital for energy financing to the developing countries , the multilateral institutions have focused more on technical , policy and institutional assistance than on direct lending in the liberalized energy market .  
An institutional focal point at the national level , with its counterparts at decentralized levels , enables a country to evolve a coherent and coordinated approach with the involvement of relevant entities in the public and private sectors , and with NGOs .  
Policy and institutional reforms to create a sound socioeconomic and political environment to transform the social and productive basis for development into one in which sustainable , equitable and genderbalanced development can take place .

While commending the spirit of international solidarity and partnership among States , civil society and the private sector manifested at the first meeting of the Global Ministerial Environment Forum , he stressed the need for a strong , financially secure institutional architecture , through which the worlds States and their peoples could develop a coherent international environmental policy .  
By decision 21 / 21 , the Council decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental group of ministers or their representatives , with the Executive Director as an ex officio member , to undertake a comprehensive policy-oriented assessment of existing institutional weaknesses as well as future needs and options for strengthened international environmental governance , including the financing of UNEP , with a view to presenting a report containing analysis and options to the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum .  
Recalling the recommendations from the Malm Ministerial Declaration 2 / that the 2002 World Summit should review the requirements for a greatly strengthened institutional structure for international environmental governance based on an assessment of future needs for an institutional architecture that has the capacity to effectively address wide-ranging environmental threats in a globalizing world , and that United Nations Environment Programmes role in this regard should be strengthened and its financial base broadened and made more predictable ,  
We should like to stress once again that responsible political management , combined with an absolute and immediate determination to implement institutional , legal and economic reforms in full , are essential prerequisites for speedy integration into European Union structures .

Government , the business community and individual businesses should cooperate in their respective ways so that HRD policies use the role of the private sector as a motor for their implementation , bearing in mind the need for regulatory and institutional change to make training and HRD effective .  
That the status of the practices of democracy , rights and freedoms in the French-speaking community over the past 10 years reflects undeniable progress : the constitutional recognition of the importance of human rights , the establishment of the institutional framework for democracy and human rights , the existence of checks and balances , progress in establishing multiparty systems in many French-speaking countries and in holding free , credible and transparent elections , the contribution of the opposition to the working of democracy , the promotion of local democracy through decentralization ;  
As indicated in last years report , although the major task of studying the global crisis of internal displacement and existing legal and institutional frameworks for addressing it is largely complete , there nonetheless remain issues on which additional research and consideration are required .

The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
The review sought to examine programme objectives and strategies aimed at reducing social disparities and gaps in basic human development , through integrated demonstration programmes , including basic social services ( primary education , health , water and sanitation ) , and to assess the institutional capacity-building for local management and decision-making , as well as community participation .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
Referring to State and institutional violence against children , which he understood to involve torture and maltreatment inflicted upon children by members of the police and security forces , especially during preventive detention , he appealed to States to punish those responsible for such violations and to take tangible measures to protect the rights of children suspected , accused or found guilty of violations of criminal law .

Taking note of the Bangkok Declaration adopted at the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( TD / 390 ) which asserted that solidarity and a strong sense of moral responsibility must be the guiding light of national and international policy and that more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making are required to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis ,  
Global Education Associates ( GEA ) is an association of individual and institutional associates in more than 90 countries , working to advance global systems that will ensure ecological integrity , peace , human rights , economic and social well-being , and democratic participation , with special care to include the voices and perspectives of poor and marginalized people of diverse cultural and religious traditions . 
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
Taking note of the Bangkok Declaration adopted at the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( TD / 390 ) which asserted that solidarity and a strong sense of moral responsibility must be the guiding light of national and international policy and that more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making are required to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis ,  
How to continue to benefit from the technical and logistical advantages of ad hoc groupings and limited representation forums , while ensuring that decisions with global repercussions are taken in forums that are more inclusive and that have clearly defined and broad-based intergovernmental mandates , such as the International Monetary and Financial Committee , the Development Committee and the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council ?  What would be the most appropriate form for an enhanced institutional relationship between WTO and the United Nations ?  
Apart from the advisory services provided by the Cooperative Branch specialists at Headquarters and ILO specialists in the field , the interregional COOPREFORM programme provides assistance in cooperative development policy , cooperative legislation , and cooperative support services , thus addressing the need to create a favourable legal , institutional and administrative environment for the development of genuine , viable cooperatives .  
Any such framework should reflect a comprehensive approach to development , geared to stimulating economic growth as a basic underlying factor for a sustained attack on poverty , and encompassing and integrating structural , social and institutional reform and pro-poor policies and programmes .  The sequencing of interventions in different areas and their timing will be critical to the effectiveness of the framework .  
The objectives of the workshop were to provide information on the occurrence , technical parameters , economic interest and potential resources contained in mineral resources other than polymetallic nodules , to identify existing institutional factors that have contributed to the discovery of such resources and continuing research on them and to provide information which would assist in drafting rules , regulations and procedures for prospecting and exploration for these mineral deposits , in particular deep sea polymetallic sulphide deposits and cobalt crusts .  
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .  
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
However , efforts to develop agricultural , livestock , fishery and forestry production as well as Guineas rural sector , have been plagued by several obstacles , such as poor rural infrastructure and facilities , the low technical level and poor management of farms and institutional weaknesses of State services , the private sector as well as of farmers organizations .  
The UNMIBH police commissioner project remains an essential institutional initiative for creating an apolitical police service , shielded from direct political interference from the ministries by functioning under a single chain of command led by an experienced police professional , designated Police Commissioner or Director of Police .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
These countries are characterized by their exposure to a series of vulnerabilities and constraints such as limited human , institutional and productive capacity ; acute susceptibility to external economic shocks , natural and man-made disasters and communicable diseases ; limited access to education , health and other social services and to natural resources ; poor infrastructure ; and lack of access to information and communication technologies .  
For their part , most LDCs have pursued economic reform programmes set out in the previous Programmes of Action , including eliminating or substantially reducing tariffs and other trade barriers , liberalizing currency regimes , privatizing public enterprises , establishing and strengthening institutional and regulatory frameworks and adopting liberal investment policies .  
This implies an increased focus on issues like good governance at national and international levels and the fight against corruption , respect for all internationally recognized human rights , gender issues , capacity and institutional building , social services supply and environmental concerns .  The majority of the poor live in rural areas .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Critical factors to stimulate productive capacity include : stable macro-economic conditions , a conducive legal and regulatory framework , adequate institutional , physical and social infrastructure and a vibrant private sector .  
While we strive our best to mobilize domestic resources and to learn from best practices , the global community must help us with increased flows of official development assistance , better trading opportunities , expanded debt relief and support for institutional development so that our people , living in urban and rural areas alike , can lead a decent and productive life .  
We have identified considerable obstacles associated with limited economic , technological and institutional capacities at all levels of government , particularly in the developing and the least developed countries .  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .

[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
Because of common purposes and objectives ( education and training ) , similar geographic and human target areas , similar operational modes and strategies and a common institutional location , there are large areas of synergetic opportunity between the programmes : funding , management and execution , cost rationalization - let alone the added value of a comprehensive and integrated approach to commercial and logistic manpower requirements .  
The institutional location of Trainmar centres is not generally relevant for an integrated approach to maritime transport and commerce , or to overall national interest : there is evidence that in some cases national authorities have not been given the opportunity of considering the most opportune institutional location of the Trainmar centres as among available educational and training institutions ; there is a heavy focus on locating Trainmar centres in ports or training facilities attached to ports .  
The framework law should include provisions on its purpose ; the targets or goals to be achieved and the time frame to be set for the achievement of those targets ; the means by which the purpose could be achieved described in broad terms , in particular the intended collaboration with civil society and the private sector and with international organizations ; institutional responsibility for the process ; and the national mechanisms for its monitoring , as well as possible recourse procedures .  
The following actions are being implemented : developing CMCs in poor communities ; obtaining from regulatory and political levels better frameworks and technical infrastructures to guarantee access to new technologies ; ensuring a necessary linkage between grass-roots development operations and regional / national authorities , providing adapted institutional information , freeing the airwaves and allowing favourable broadcasting licensing .

In 43 countries , integrated programmes address poverty alleviation through industrial development by improving industrial governance and institutional infrastructure , strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises , upgrading technological capacities , skills and access to modern technology , export and trade capabilities , and adopting energy efficient and cleaner productive measures .  
In keeping with its aim of overcoming economic , social and institutional obstacles that prevent the population from enjoying decent living conditions , the Government of the Republic is promoting a poverty-reduction strategy that includes short - , medium - and long-term goals .  Areas of action have been identified that call for both the State and society at large to work to reduce the magnitude of poverty , which affects the majority of the population .  
On the second challenge or the soft infrastructure , managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional transit systems needed for effective utilization of assets , landlocked and transit developing countries should create an even stronger partnership with each other .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional level should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
Poor management of finances and public corporations has not been conducive to the creation of a favourable macroeconomic and institutional environment for stimulating the economic and social activities of households and enterprises .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
The actions to be undertaken by least developed countries focus , inter alia , on : strengthening efforts to integrate trade policies into national development policies towards poverty eradication , improving economic openness and policy predictability , as well as sound macroeconomic policy , and developing human and institutional capacities for effective and informed participation in the multilateral trading system and for effective negotiations on trade , finance , technology transfer and related areas .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
The promotion of a conducive macroeconomic environment , good governance and democracy , as well as strengthening structural aspects of the economy and improved institutional and human capacities , was regarded as important also in the context of attracting FDI and other private external flows .  
In addition to its traditional responsibility for identifying requirements , establishing aircraft technical specifications , evaluating technical compliance , administering air charters , and managing expenditures , its responsibilities now include the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , such as the operation of aerodromes , and the integrated employment of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes , to ensure that peacekeeping air operations always comply with international standards regardless of the condition of the aeronautical infrastructure within the mission areas .  
These responsibilities encompass the identification of requirements , the establishment of aircraft technical specifications , the evaluation of contractors technical compliance , the administration of air charters , the management of expenditures , the development and promulgation of institutional standards and operating guidelines for all types of aeronautical activities , and the integrated use of civil and military aircraft from diverse regulatory regimes ;  
The most important substantive issue was likely to be institutional , namely the creation of an integrated framework acting under the auspices of the United Nations to ensure coherence in the treatment of international economic questions , avoiding in this process any negative impact on the autonomy and individual mandates of specific organizations such as the Bretton Woods institutions or the different members of the United Nations family .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade result in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
Regulatory and institutional reforms undertaken to modernize and improve the efficient working of transit transport systems at the national and regional levels should be maintained by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned .  
Many landlocked and transit developing countries have also accepted that the changing structure of transit trade results in demands for more efficient institutional arrangements at the national and regional level .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
At the national level , three distinct but complementary institutional structures are emerging to reflect the expanding role of the private sector as the main provider of transport and related commercial services .  
The international community should continue to support policy , legislative , regulatory and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , establishing autonomous accountable transport authorities , strengthening private sector associations and promoting modalities for fostering effective dialogue between the public and private sectors .  
He believes that a critical objective of the entire process of institutional reform must be an effective separation of legislative , executive and judicial powers with human rights and the rule of law as its foundation .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
He noted the Secretary-Generals recommendation that Governments should be urged to take steps to prepare a transparent , stable and predictable framework for investment and for building institutional infrastructures and that multilateral and bilateral donors should be encouraged to adopt suitable measures to permit faster and more extensive debt relief for poor countries .  
With these political and institutional developments in place , and with a growing understanding of the nature and scope of the mine problem taking root , the international mine action community is ready to move ahead from an approach that reacts to problems as they arise , to one in which mine action issues are addressed strategically at the national and global level .  
Human rights must be respected and an adequate legal framework developed ; there was a need to apply sound macroeconomic policies , combat corruption and strengthen human and institutional capacities , both nationally and on the basis of international cooperation .  
A range of interests needs to be accommodated by that legal mechanismthe debtor , the owners and management of the debtor , the creditors who may be secured to varying degrees , employees , fiscal creditors , guarantors of debt and unsecured creditors , as well as government , commercial and social institutions and practices that are relevant to the design of the mechanism and to the institutional framework required for its operation .

A national system includes all institutional , legal and procedural arrangements made within a Party included in Annex I for estimating anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , and for reporting and archiving inventory information .  
The Government also reported that a supreme decree of June 2001 established the Truth Commission , whose mandate is to help shed light on the crimes and human rights violations committed by terrorist organizations and State agents , to prepare proposals on moral and material reparations for victims and their families and to recommend legal and institutional reforms as preventive guarantees .  
Also recognizes the critical need for countries to undertake economic , institutional and regulatory reforms to support wide trade liberalization and to create an enabling environment in which trade can truly serve as an engine for economic growth and development and , in this regard , calls upon the international community to continue to support the capacity-building efforts of developing countries , taking into account their national circumstances ;

The objectives of the plan include improving police competency and integrity , organizational capacity , institutional integrity and cooperation between civilian police and the judiciary ; fully establishing the State border service ; enhancing cooperation among law enforcement institutions ; and increasing police and public awareness of their respective rights , duties , and role as members of the international community .  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
The national focal points and national coordinating bodies can promote additional and parallel consultations with different institutional and social categories and / or in different provincial / local areas in order to ensure their greater participation in the process .  
In the light of the evolving nature of the institutional support provided for the regional action programme in Asia , the Asian national focal points may agree on the modalities of reporting at the regional level , on the understanding that the task managers and hosts of the thematic programme networks of the RAP would draft the chapters of the regional report corresponding to their respective fields of activites .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Although the database could be expanded in the future to include additional substantive or institutional data , at this point it is necessary to concentrate on data that can easily be transmitted and integrated given the limited resources and time available to the secretariat .  
On the contrary , international cooperation must be strengthened through increased development of institutional and human capacity , a more dynamic transfer of technology and know-how and adequate financing .  
Mexico was taking an active part in the work of the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group of Ministers or Their Representatives on International Environmental Governance , whose work , which consisted of making a detailed analysis of current institutional weaknesses and future needs and options in terms of strengthening international environmental governance , would contribute significantly to the Summits preparatory process . 
Tunisia also attached great importance to the transparency of the Rio + 10 process , which , after assessing progress over the past 10 years , should develop specific action for the future and establish a detailed schedule for implementation of the Rio commitments , particularly those involving human and institutional capacity-building , the transfer of ecologically rational technologies and the provision of financial resources . 
Tunisia was a signatory of most of the international conventions on environmental protection and had been among the first countries to implement the Rio Summit recommendations at the national level by setting up an institutional and legal framework for protection of the environment , establishing a national sustainable development committee , developing a national Agenda 21 programme and mainstreaming environmental protection into the various economic and social plans . 
Globalization and its consequences , which may limit the possibility of achieving sustainable development in the Arab region , and the need to set up the Arab region in line with its own economic and institutional conditions and create a strong Arab regional bloc based on the regions cultural , civilizational and economic constituents ;
