A new round of structural adjustment is being carried out throughout the world ; new - and high-technology industry and newly emerging industry are developing robust ; intellectual economy has raged like a storm , and world economic competition has become increasingly intense .  
Zhu Lilan said , the future development of the high-tech zones will be linked to state economic restructuring , the expansion of domestic demand , and the development of west China , and will be aimed at the requirements of the state 's medium and long-term development strategy ; we will make all-round plans and rational distribution and concentrate forces on cultivating projects with their own intellectual property rights .

The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .

During the 1996 consultations between China and the United States on negotiations on intellectual property rights , China 's fight against copyright piracy in the illegal manufacture of sound and video recordings had an irrefutable record of glorious achievements .  This was powerful proof of the huge effort China has put forth in protecting intellectual property rights .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .

To wallow in heresy will make a person lose his will and freedom , one will be susceptible to hallucination , panic , schizophrenia , guilty feeling , self-doubt about one 's status which eventually will lead to one 's inability to establish mutually accommodating and close relations with others , deteriorating intellectual power and sense of humor , weakening fitness and power of judgment , and disruption of ethical family relations and economic loss .  
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
Deputy Ren Shimao , Secretary of the Huangshi municipal party committee , noted : those enterprises that intend to go abroad must upgrade their business management concepts , which include : taking the initiative in striking out on the international market , being prepared for surviving and growing amid fair competition in the international and domestic markets , attaching great importance to information collection both at home and abroad , and respecting others ' intellectual property rights while safeguarding ours . 
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
This is so because , first , radical and emotional nationalism directly appeals to " first principles of survival " and attacks all dissenting voices as threats to national survival ; in this way , it attempts to exclusively occupy intellectual and public opinion commanding heights , so as to become the dominant speech prevailing over all other human values and the virtual " supreme command . "  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Over the last 20 years , the intellectual property system has become a basic legal system and major policy means of various countries to give impetus to technological innovation , and has played a significant role in invigorating economy and enhancing international competitiveness .  
At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .  
We are willing to strive hard , together with all countries in the world , for the institution of a fair and rational intellectual property system favorable to promoting scientific and technological as well as economic development in various countries , and for the creation of a fine environment of respecting knowledge , advocating science , and protecting intellectual property rights for all humanity .

The massive utilization of high-tech equipment has established a firm material foundation for joint combat , and at the same time it is giving an increasingly stronger intellectual and knowledge orientation to logistical support .  The contradiction between the lack of enough skilled specialists and the growing quantities of new and high-tech equipment will become more pronounced .  
In general , our township enterprises know little about promoting exports , improving and relying on themselves , making policy decisions based on information , and respecting intellectual property .  They are void of ideals about observing international practice , placing emphasis on production quality , running business according to law , and encouraging innovations .  They pay little attention to credit and people with special skills and ideas to reduce investment risks .  
Fei Xiaotong , honorary chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Democratic League and a famous socialist , made a speech at the meeting .

Over the past century and half , it has kept advancing continually in practice , developing continually in practice , studying new situations , answering new questions , and continually incorporating , borrowing , and integrating various outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , thereby enabling Marxism to always maintain its vitality and to continually open new realms .  
Therefore , upholding Marxism 's guidance position will not only not stop it from incorporating and borrowing other outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , but also enable us to more scientifically distinguish the real from the fake and the correct from the wrong , to incorporate good elements , to reject bad elements , to have a broader field of vision , and to become even broader minded , a situation which will be more conducive to creating and enriching the new culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .

In recent years , the new international trend is to integrate technical specifications and intellectual property rights protection to form a new alliance of monopoly in technologies .  It makes use of the unique status of technical specifications to strengthen the relevant intellectual property rights protections and makes use of the exclusive ( or monopolistic ) nature of intellectual property rights to gain de facto monopoly in certain kinds of technical specifications as a way to maximize economic profit .  
Based on this , we need to start from structural reform , reactivate our existing scientific and technological resources , strengthen our market-oriented research and development , vigorously spread the use of new and high technologies as well as applied technologies , step up the transformation of scientific and technological advances , accelerate the industrialization process of new and high technological achievements , and give shape to a number of new and high technological industries that enjoy independent intellectual property rights .  
A batch of large corporations and enterprise groups with great strength should be fostered and developed in major industries .

"

The trends of international development in recent yeas show that as the funds needed for investment in research and development have been doubled and redoubled , enterprises have been unable to innovate in products alone and that with the rapid renewal of knowledge and technology , it is difficult for enterprises , although with patents and intellectual property rights , to recover their investments in research and development in a short period of time before the appearance of other newer technologies .  
All of the original civil , economic ( intellectual property ) , and communications divisions applied the civil procedure law when trying cases , and all the cases they tried were related to the legal relations between equal and civil entities .

Q : It is hard to escape the conclusion that in the past the government 's attitude toward the protection of foreign intellectual property rights has been " whether or not this is beneficial for us or harmful for us .

"  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common .

True , in The End of the Century she still shows an intellectual 's contemplative acuity , but is that gentle and kind glowing mother of Children the same woman who wrote Wild Fire , a collection of critical political and social writings , ten years ago ?  
In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society .

As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people .

One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education .

In the industrial age , enterprises had to sell a physical product to make a buck . But now that we have entered the information age and acceptance of the idea of intellectual property rights has become widespread , firms have begun to view things as intangible and abstract as technical know-how and business acumen as their most valuable money-making tools .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
As early as 1975 , brain specialists had discovered that the cerebral cortex , unique to primates , was responsible for intellectual activities such as language and reasoning . The limbic system lies below the cortex and pre-dates it . Sometimes called the " mammalian brain , " it is involved in the expression of emotions . On the lowest level lies the brain stem , sometimes called the reptilian brain .  
His father was a traditional intellectual deeply committed to the time-honored ideal of contributing to the welfare of the nation . All his life , he has maintained an austere devotion to the straight and narrow . What he values is loyalty , continuation of the family line , parental benevolence toward children , and respect and devotion in return . All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .  
In the 1980s , in a China undergoing reform and liberalization and stressing intellectual liberation and the May Fourth spirit of enlightenment , eminent mainland scholar Wang Yuanhua responded to an overseas scholars ' assertion that the radical thinking of May Fourth Movement figures was expressed in " all-round rejection of tradition " with the following words : " What the May Fourth Movement was up against was a feudalism which had been the ruling ideology for thousands of years . . . . Hence to rebel against it required a much greater effort . "  
That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam .

As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .

Despite this association and the new intellectual , political and economic trends brought about by the changes , the structural notions of the international system have not developed in tandem with the requirements of human development , as manifested by the communications revolution , the exchange of ideas , the flow of information and the technological applications that have influenced international relations in various ways . 
This interrelatedness of interests has formed a sort of common culture among nations and has created a favourable climate for the exchange of ideas and the tools of knowledge , thus enabling cultural and intellectual interaction among peoples of the world and enhancing a deeper understanding of the bases of world peace and security , an objective which the United Nations has sought to achieve over the past five decades .

Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
This includes the right to maintain , protect and develop the past , present and future manifestations of their cultures , such as archaeological and historical sites , artifacts , designs , ceremonies , technologies and visual and performing arts and literature , as well as the right to the restitution of cultural , intellectual , religious and spiritual property taken without their free and informed consent or in violation of their traditions and customs , as well as the law of the State concerned .

Despite concerns that Internet access may be creating a new social strata of haves and have-nots , electronic communications have the potential to increase the exchange of knowledge rapidly around the world in an open , easy and relatively democratic manner , which is not only useful for linking scientists and scientific centres with each other but also for opening up available information to ordinary citizens instantly on demand , reducing their intellectual distance from scientific information .  
Harnessing the positive potential of development and trade is also being developed in other key areas of the Convention , such as access to genetic resources ; intellectual property rights ; technology transfer ; and social and economic incentives .  
As shown in the upper right-hand box of figure 3 , if the rules of the game , including intellectual property rights , standards and tariffs for access to global networks , are put in place for the GII on a highly cooperative basis , and if competitive forces are strong , then a balanced environment of competition and cooperation among ICT companies will emerge .  
Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .

An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
Some progress has been made by the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) since 1995 with regard to drafting essential legal instruments governing economic activity in areas such as private investment , enterprise activity , banking , public finance , industrial zones , standards and safety , civil service and intellectual property .  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .

Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Joint ventures , often utilizing extrabudgetary funds , have been organized with influential media organizations , leaders of civil society , intellectual and educational groups , the business community , appropriate private enterprises and relevant governmental institutions .  
Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
Also requests the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization to extend appropriate assistance to Governments in designing and setting up programmes to encourage the creative , artistic and intellectual potential of children with disabilities , and through its regional offices , to conduct seminars and workshops to provide appropriate training in those fields to teachers , parents , social workers and others concerned ;  
Hence , renewed commitment is needed from developed countries to promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , the access to and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) and corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
There appeared to be broad agreement that the existing legal frameworks for the protection of the intellectual property of indigenous people were inadequate and that some form of sui generis special protection was necessary to encourage indigenous people to share their knowledge and expertise with the international community .  
The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
These are , in particular : political leaders , members of Government and of parliament and of other elected bodies ; teaching staff at every level of educational systems and those engaged in non-formal education of children and adults ; journalists ; members of the intellectual community as a whole ; religious leaders ; those having managerial functions at various levels ; non-governmental organizations , especially of women and youth .  
In order to achieve those objectives , it was necessary to establish a modern legal framework in order to protect intellectual property and attract external resources for productive investment and , lastly , to ensure the participation of civil society and the integration of society with a view to harmonious and balanced development .  
Its principal elements included political and economic stability , the rule of law , a strong institutional and regulatory framework providing intellectual property protection and protection against unfair expropriation , and dispute-resolution mechanisms .  
They stated that an enabling political and policy framework was required , for example , with regard to political and economic stability , intellectual property rights and an adequate legal framework , and fighting corruption .  
Reinforcing international dialogue in the appropriate multilateral and bilateral forums to achieve an adequate global regulatory framework for electronic commerce , in particular in data security , data protection , intellectual property rights , and taxation .  
All peoples of the world possess equal facilities for attaining the highest level in intellectual , technical , social , economic , cultural and political development .  
An independent and impartial court required full-time judges , who should have high intellectual and moral qualities and professional competence in both criminal law and international humanitarian law .  
A rash of unexplained disappearances and suspicious deaths of intellectual and political activists has set nerves on edge and reinforced fears for the further development of a law _ abiding society .  
Governments and relevant international and regional organizations have been encouraged to conduct case studies , and communicate these to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on the impacts of intellectual property rights on the achievement of the objectives of the Convention , including relationships between intellectual property rights and the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities ( decisions III / 14 and III / 17 of the Conference of Parties ) .  
These could include making appropriate amendments to existing forms of intellectual property rights ; implementing new administrative procedures ( for example , with regard to the patent application process ) ; and using alternative standard forms of legal protection rather than by legislation ( for example , material transfer agreements , biodiversity contracts and licencing agreements ) .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements .  
The law on national education reflected the provisions of article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child by stipulating that education should be directed to the moral , intellectual and physical development of children and should provide them with the basic knowledge they needed to live in society and to have an impact on the countrys socio-economic situation . 
The objectives of the report were to make UNU an integral part of the United Nations renewal process ; to explore ways by which its potential could be realized more fully as a strategic intellectual resource for the multilateral system of cooperation ; and to strengthen its adaptability to the emerging or uncharted challenges of the next century .

Efforts will be intensified to secure reviews of UNDP special reports and other substantive studies in international and national development-related journals and academic periodicals in order to heighten visibility of the contribution made by UNDP to the intellectual debate on current issues of concern to such readership circles .  
The Circle brings together experts , scholars , researchers and professionals from diverse academic backgrounds and intellectual traditions united by a common endeavour : working towards promoting a holistic concept of sustainable development that takes into account all its profound and complex dimensions .

Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
Mr . Rao ( Observer for the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) ) said that the objectives of the Decade were close to the nature and functions of WIPO , which was not only the international secretariat for existing treaty bodies relating to intellectual property but was also unique in that it provided direct access to private innovators and industry for the registration of patents , trademarks and industrial designs for the purpose of international recognition .  
In addition , WIPO had established a specific institutional mechanism , the Worldwide Academy , which was dedicated to optimizing the use of intellectual property systems by enhancing human resources development programmes at the national and regional levels .  
Furthermore , the international community must examine the continued viability of frameworks for the protection of intellectual property , ensuring a balance between the legitimate rights of owners and innovators to a secure and appropriate return on their investment and the larger social benefit that would result from wide , unrestricted knowledge flows .  
Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security , the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic , intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits ,  
There are also seven institutions for the intellectual development of mentally retarded persons , as well as two schools run by charitable associations , which admit children suffering from slight to moderate mental retardation and , after their readaptation , provide them with education in accordance with the syllabuses of the Ministry of Education in a manner consistent with their abilities .  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
To establish a single economic space in order to ensure socio-economic development on the basis of the united material and intellectual potential of the participating States and the use of market mechanisms for the functioning of the economy ;  
Socialism had different related meanings : it represented an intellectual trend based on the critique of the developing bourgeois society ; it was the expression of a political and social movement aiming at reforms , influence or power ; and it referred to an ideal economic and social system intended to replace and overcome capitalism and its perceived flaws .  
This new development , and the co-evolution that resulted between the two families of historical national economies the capitalist and the socialist deeply influenced and modified the three other dimensions ( intellectual , political and normative ) of socialism inherited from the previous century .  
His intellectual leadership , vision and commitment to development have been critical to the re-emergence of UNCTAD as a serious , competent and responsible organization providing a balanced treatment of a wide range of interrelated issues in development in an increasingly interdependent and globalizing world .  
The basis for this conviction lies in our rich history and great culture , which has made an invaluable contribution to world civilization ; in our natural and intellectual potential ; in the high spiritual and moral values of our people ; in their enterprise , open thinking and desire to take their rightful place in the world society .  
We hope that international efforts will bear fruit and that the restoration of cultural properties to their legitimate owners will be encouraged , so that our various cultural heritages , which not only have historical and ancestral value but which also represent the intellectual and moral heritage of future generations , can be preserved .

States are not obligated to disclose information that is vital to their national security or is considered an industrial secret or information protected by intellectual property rights .  
Yet it has been established that some intellectual property rights claimed by multinational corporations are actually derived from indigenous peoples and communities whose know-how and perfect familiarity with various elements of nature and the environment have enabled them over the centuries to accumulate scientific knowledge that is tried and tested but has remained unknown and is consequently not protected by the WTO system .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .

Consequently , the entire range of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , are relevant to intellectual property systems .  
The fact that the human person is the central subject and primary beneficiary of human rights distinguishes human rights , including the right of authors to the moral and material interests in their works , from legal rights recognized in intellectual property systems .

The reflection of knowledge economy and innovative ability in military domain can be seen in the emergence of intellectual weaponry , informationized warfare , and military units that are equipped with digitized equipment .  This is a fact , which proves that the first and earliest application of advanced and new science and technology is in the battlefield .  Therefore , the innovation of military knowledge , the innovation of military science and technology , and the innovation of strategy and operational method are necessary for defeating the enemy and winning the victory .

During the 1996 consultations between China and the United States on negotiations on intellectual property rights , China 's fight against copyright piracy in the illegal manufacture of sound and video recordings had an irrefutable record of glorious achievements .  This was powerful proof of the huge effort China has put forth in protecting intellectual property rights .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .

Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
Third , thanks to the close cooperation between the key techniques developed during the implementation of the " 863 " Project and the industrial circle , China has created products with its own intellectual property rights in such hot point fields of international high-tech competition as biological engineering medicine , communications equipment , high-performance computers , Chinese information processing platform , artificial crystal , photoelectron material and apparatuses .  
Deputy Ren Shimao , Secretary of the Huangshi municipal party committee , noted : those enterprises that intend to go abroad must upgrade their business management concepts , which include : taking the initiative in striking out on the international market , being prepared for surviving and growing amid fair competition in the international and domestic markets , attaching great importance to information collection both at home and abroad , and respecting others ' intellectual property rights while safeguarding ours . 
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
This is so because , first , radical and emotional nationalism directly appeals to " first principles of survival " and attacks all dissenting voices as threats to national survival ; in this way , it attempts to exclusively occupy intellectual and public opinion commanding heights , so as to become the dominant speech prevailing over all other human values and the virtual " supreme command . "  
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
If it is said that in the era of industrial economy , knowledge could find expression in a combatant 's skills or a commander 's tactics , in a future war , intellectual fighting capacity and knowledge confrontation will respectively constitute a major symbol of military strength and a fundamental characteristic of military confrontation .  
Over the last 20 years , the intellectual property system has become a basic legal system and major policy means of various countries to give impetus to technological innovation , and has played a significant role in invigorating economy and enhancing international competitiveness .  
At the beginning of reform and opening up , China began to institute an intellectual property system .  After more than 20 years of endeavor , a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights has taken shape , and an intellectual property protection system that integrates judiciary with administrative law enforcement has been instituted .  In the protection of intellectual property rights , a lot of work has been done , which has made contributions to the promotion of scientific and technological advancement and economic and social development .  
We are willing to strive hard , together with all countries in the world , for the institution of a fair and rational intellectual property system favorable to promoting scientific and technological as well as economic development in various countries , and for the creation of a fine environment of respecting knowledge , advocating science , and protecting intellectual property rights for all humanity .

The massive utilization of high-tech equipment has established a firm material foundation for joint combat , and at the same time it is giving an increasingly stronger intellectual and knowledge orientation to logistical support .  The contradiction between the lack of enough skilled specialists and the growing quantities of new and high-tech equipment will become more pronounced .  
In general , our township enterprises know little about promoting exports , improving and relying on themselves , making policy decisions based on information , and respecting intellectual property .  They are void of ideals about observing international practice , placing emphasis on production quality , running business according to law , and encouraging innovations .  They pay little attention to credit and people with special skills and ideas to reduce investment risks .  
Fei Xiaotong , honorary chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Democratic League and a famous socialist , made a speech at the meeting .  He recalled the brilliant achievements made by the CPC in leading the Chinese people to seek the truth and strive for happiness in connection with his personal experience .

It organically combines being rigorously scientific with being highly revolutionary , expounds profound theories with simple and easily understood language , and uses irrefutable facts and incontrovertible logic to reveal laws of development of human society , thereby pointing out the correct direction of human progress and social development and becoming an immortal monument to intellectual activity in the history of human civilization .  
It critically incorporated British and French utopian socialism 's theory on fairness and justice in human society , the rational cores of dialectics of Germany 's classical philosophy and materialism , British classical political economy 's method for dissecting the capitalist economy , and intellectual pith in the latest achievements of natural sciences .  
Over the past century and half , it has kept advancing continually in practice , developing continually in practice , studying new situations , answering new questions , and continually incorporating , borrowing , and integrating various outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , thereby enabling Marxism to always maintain its vitality and to continually open new realms .  
Therefore , upholding Marxism 's guidance position will not only not stop it from incorporating and borrowing other outstanding intellectual and cultural achievements , but also enable us to more scientifically distinguish the real from the fake and the correct from the wrong , to incorporate good elements , to reject bad elements , to have a broader field of vision , and to become even broader minded , a situation which will be more conducive to creating and enriching the new culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
To make our party represent the direction of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must make its theory , line , programs , principles , policies , and all its work reflect the requirements of the national , scientific , and popular socialist culture that develops toward modernization , the world , and the future , and enable them to upgrade the ideological and ethical quality and scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation and to provide spiritual impetus and intellectual support for China 's economic development and social progress .

China will seriously implement the spirit of the State Council on reorganizing and standardizing the market economic order .  All the departments will coordinate with each other in breaking with local protectionism and trade monopoly and strike hard at fake and inferior goods .  They will also protect intellectual property rights , check indiscriminate exaction of charges and fines , and create a unified and open market environment for foreign investors to carry out competition on equal footing .

In recent years , the new international trend is to integrate technical specifications and intellectual property rights protection to form a new alliance of monopoly in technologies .  It makes use of the unique status of technical specifications to strengthen the relevant intellectual property rights protections and makes use of the exclusive ( or monopolistic ) nature of intellectual property rights to gain de facto monopoly in certain kinds of technical specifications as a way to maximize economic profit .  
Based on this , we need to start from structural reform , reactivate our existing scientific and technological resources , strengthen our market-oriented research and development , vigorously spread the use of new and high technologies as well as applied technologies , step up the transformation of scientific and technological advances , accelerate the industrialization process of new and high technological achievements , and give shape to a number of new and high technological industries that enjoy independent intellectual property rights .  
A batch of large corporations and enterprise groups with great strength should be fostered and developed in major industries .  They should possess their own intellectual property rights , and have strong international competition power .  At the same time , it is necessary to actively support small and medium-sized companies , especially technology companies , and promote their development in the orientation of being " specialized , sophisticated , special , and new . "  
One of the most prominent mistakes in this misunderstanding zone is this : Some immature methods adopted in the past by the Chinese intellectual elite and common Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have been considered as China 's democratic methods .

We should build an advanced culture to meet the people 's growing needs in cultural life and provide the productive forces development with a spiritual motive force as well as intellectual support .  
The trends of international development in recent yeas show that as the funds needed for investment in research and development have been doubled and redoubled , enterprises have been unable to innovate in products alone and that with the rapid renewal of knowledge and technology , it is difficult for enterprises , although with patents and intellectual property rights , to recover their investments in research and development in a short period of time before the appearance of other newer technologies .  
All of the original civil , economic ( intellectual property ) , and communications divisions applied the civil procedure law when trying cases , and all the cases they tried were related to the legal relations between equal and civil entities .  However , through the current restructuring , all of the economic ( intellectual property ) cases and communications and transportation cases have been incorporated to the major category of civil justice .

Both the central and local governments will offer support and preferences in the form of increased expenditure and subsidies .  
Wan Xueyuan said the " transmission of oil from the west to the east " would be a symbolic project in China 's development of the western region in the 21st century .  Meanwhile , the booming special industries in the western region , which include the rare earth industry in Inner Mongolia , the development of herbal and biological medicine in the western provinces , and tomato and safflower processing in Xinjiang , all badly need intellectual support .  
Wan said that the grand occasion of international personnel and intellectual exchanges held in Xinjiang is a specific manifestation of the Chinese Government preparing personnel resources for implementing the strategy of developing the western region and implementing the project of guiding intellectual resources to the western region .  
Under a new situation , we always insist on the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture and push the prosperous development of socialism 's culture and art to satisfy the growing need for peoples ' cultural spirit , and provide the insured thoughts , motives of spirit and intellectual support for economic development and improvement of the whole society , and build a nice social atmosphere and human cultural circumstance , above are honorable and difficult historical responsibilities of the cultural and art workers .

We must guide and organize high-tech research and development in the light of the strategic demands of national development and the demands of the market , and effectively promote scientific and technological innovation with a view to achieving our own intellectual property rights in order to develop a high-tech industry that is capable of competing in the international market and developing by leaps and bounds .  
Beijing is strong in the fields of science and technology , personnel , intelligence and information , which form a solid foundation for the development of the high-tech industry .  It must launch a number of major high-tech projects with autonomous intellectual property rights and strive to achieve real breakthroughs in the development of high-tech industry , the promotion of scientific and technological innovation and the training of personnel .

For the type of woman who is keen on studying , has a high level of education and may have held a demanding job prior to marriage , the unchallenging and stultifying nature of humdrum voluntary work holds little appeal . She might prefer to go in for a more intellectual type of voluntary work .  
Professor Ho Peng-yoke , a member of the Academia Sinica and present director of the Needham Research Institute , says that at that time there was great interest among scholars in traditional science and technology partly for reasons that were not strictly academic : China 's international position had declined drastically and she was backwards economically , technologically and militarily . In addition to this the condescension of Western and Japanese scholars stirred up an intellectual " war to defend culture , " which involved working hard to glorify the achievements of ancient Chinese science and technology .  
Following Taiwan 's economic development , with a huge trade surplus , vast foreign exchange reserves , and a per capita income of US $ 8,000 , Taiwan 's economic strength was visible everywhere , and had become adequate to bear the costs of buying " intellectual property . "  
Q : It is hard to escape the conclusion that in the past the government 's attitude toward the protection of foreign intellectual property rights has been " whether or not this is beneficial for us or harmful for us .

"  
This group of new directors , called the fifth generation , includes such figures as Chen Kai-ge and Tian Zhuang-zhuang . They share some things in common .

True , in The End of the Century she still shows an intellectual 's contemplative acuity , but is that gentle and kind glowing mother of Children the same woman who wrote Wild Fire , a collection of critical political and social writings , ten years ago ?  
In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
On the surface , this is a simple case of who controls the rights to a piece of music . But because those involved are members of a small group of indigenous people , given the surge in ethnic self-identification in Taiwan in recent years , the incident has naturally been interpreted as one in which " certain foreigners and Han Chinese have stolen and exploited the cultural and intellectual property of indigenous people . "  
In fact , direct sales takes hard work , and requires a complete commitment of one 's whole person ( intellectual , physical , and emotional ) , time , and maybe even family ( with parents and siblings brought into the sales network ) .

All of these values naturally show through in his films , and perhaps limit his freedom as a film maker .

Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking .

It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .

The international community should promote , facilitate and finance , as appropriate , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the corresponding know-how , in particular to developing countries , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 .

All RCF programmes for Asia and the Pacific are based on one or more of the following regional criteria : sharing and / or pooling resources ( including intellectual and natural resources ) ; addressing trans-boundary issues ; addressing a common need or common problem ; and developing or promoting agreed upon regional regimes , norms or policies .

Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
In the area of macroeconomic policy , we have proceeded to liberalize the trade and exchange regimes to foster enhanced competitiveness ; streamline the incentive framework ; privatize State-owned enterprises to promote increasing levels of private investment ; promote entrepreneurial activity through , among other measures , a venture capital regime ; and to modernize and strengthen intellectual property legislation to encourage investment and the transfer of technology .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
Accordingly , the need to safeguard private investment through strong intellectual property regimes must be compensated by workable arrangements that ensure equitable sharing of socio-economic benefits with the developing world .
