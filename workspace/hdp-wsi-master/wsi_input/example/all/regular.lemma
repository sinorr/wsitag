She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
Lai continues : " University gay organizations play an important role in the gay rights movement . However , students graduate and leave , and there are difficulties maintaining communications between schools . In order to achieve vertical continuity of experience , and horizontal integration and mutual support , it is critical to have regular activities for campus homosexual groups to exchange ideas . "  
Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .  
Some even say that light is emitted . In addition , in observing the statistical data , Chen also noted that the electrical currents and electromagnetic waves both have very regular directional characteristics . " This is exactly what is described in The Yellow Emperor 's Canon of Internal Medicine when it speaks of the movement of ' meridian chi ' and ' subtle nutritious chi ' along the 12 channels .  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
T'ienti at regular times provides free " cosmic qi healing . " Wearing their " struggle suits " - yellow shirts with blue pants-the envoys of T'ienti first chant the 20-character mantra before turning themselves into mediums that use the " Great Spirit of the Universe " to cleanse their patients ' bodies . From time to time they extend their arms to accept invisible golden pills into paper cups , which their patients wash down with water .  
Born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth and well acquainted with the finer privileges in life , she never attended a single day of school in the regular education system , but that has n't kept her from developing into one of Taiwan 's best inkwash artists .  
The term tian wen literally means " the pattern of the skies , " and refers to the systematic study of heavenly events-the waxing and waning of the moon , sunspot activity , planetary movements , the type and color of comets , and the shape and splitting of sunspots . Ancient Chinese astronomers were especially interested in what they called " guest stars , " i.e . a supernova explosion or any other one-off event that did not fit the regular pattern . They carefully noted dates , duration , position , and brightness .  
Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
However , the creation of a happier learning environment in elementary school is now running up against the hard reality of regular examinations and competitive pressures to advance in junior high school , which still operates along more traditional lines .  
The students frolic on the wooden floors in sneakers , running , jumping , sitting , lying down . Students are relaxed and there 's a certain kind of warm atmosphere that they might not even find in their own homes . The classrooms at Yung'an are not divided into a single room per class , as at regular schools .  
Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
Currently the weaving class has been held for three terms , and several dozen people have already mastered the basic techniques . The community has also sold looms . It 's just unfortunate that the women of the village , after finishing their regular housework , do n't have very much time leftover . Without any economic motivation , few continue with weaving after taking the course .  
In addition , in 1999 , after the streamlining of the provincial government , city and county chronic disease control offices either were merged with other agencies or discontinued their tuberculosis operations . Medical care for TB gradually shifted from specialist hospitals to regular health care institutions . Some of the highly trained tuberculosis specialists retired , while others left their jobs , or were assigned to other positions . The old TB prevention infrastructure today no longer exists .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
In order to strengthen the tuberculosis treatment network , the Department of Health has made preliminary plans to use Taipei 's Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Taoyuan Hospital , Taichung Hospital , the Center for Chest Disease , and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital as diagnostic referral centers for northern , central , and southern Taiwan , accepting TB patients who have been diagnosed at regular hospitals or whose disease is proving difficult to treat .  
Such plans all emphasize lively and vivid presentation , and putting fun into learning . But the school authorities are also very aware that some parents might think the teachers are " not doing their regular work " or just playing games with the students . For this reason they must first persuade parents to support the approach . Fortunately , the experimental plan is aimed at first-grade students who entered junior high school in 2002 and who do n't yet feel the pressures of academic testing , so resistance is minimal .  
Before that time , all primary and junior high school teachers were trained in specialist teacher training institutions or in the education departments of a small number of regular universities . These students were all government funded , and the government was responsible for their professional placement after graduation . The students were guaranteed lifetime employment , and aside from their professional training , their education emphasized a sense of national spirit .  
In line with the harsh predictions concerning " dejobbing " set forth in the book Jobshift : How to Prosper in a Workplace without Jobs , regular full-time , lifelong jobs with fixed objectives are quickly and quietly disappearing . After being laid off , many individuals are setting up their own private offices . Some do well ; most find themselves vulnerable . Left with no choice , they become security guards , sell insurance , do what they can to earn a couple extra bucks .  
located to the east of tian'anmen square , the museum of chinese history is the first national museum in china with exhibition halls of 8,000 square meters besides the regular exhibition of chinese comprehensive history , special exhibitions on various subjects are often held at the museum  
While the Working Capital Fund is the primary source of reserve capital in respect of the regular budget , its level ( $ 100-million , less amounts required to meet unforeseen expenditures ) has not been changed since 1982 .  
Together with the established posts funded from the regular budget , the continuing posts would serve as the primary resource , providing the minimum level required to sustain the Organization 's peace-keeping activities .  
" Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in civil , political , economic , social and cultural matters , as well as democratic values exemplified by free and regular elections ;  
The compact fluorescent lamps more recently available , on the other hand , provide reasonably attractive light , fit regular incandescent fixtures and achieve an efficiency of 61 lumens per watt , or 3.8 times the efficiency of a comparable incandescent lamp .  
The flat annual fee is then applied to the applicable assessment base which equals the total net assessment for the United Nations regular budget for the year , adjusted for tax refunds .  
Revision of the existing system , which would allow , inter alia , for automatic updating of the scale , with permanent members of the Security Council paying a uniform fixed premium on their regular budget contributions , economically less developed countries benefiting from that surcharge in proportion to their per capita income and economically more developed countries paying the same percentage as towards the regular budget ;  
Previously , the regular programme was divided into three parts : the General Fund per se , funded ongoing activities ( items originally in the General Fund that had received special funding ) and capital and special projects ( investments required to expand and improve the Agency 's capital facilities , and ongoing activities which had received special funding yet which were not part of the Agency 's core activities ) .  
In addition to its regular annual session , during 1994 JUNIC held two ad hoc sessions to develop and coordinate the implementation of joint information activities in connection with the major international conferences scheduled for 1994 and 1995 , and in particular with the World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women .  
In reply to a question on the comparative costs of the various ways of providing translation , the Committee was informed that , in the absence of an accurate cost-accounting system , these could be listed at this stage as follows in the order of ascending costs : contractual translation ; local temporary assistance staff ; regular in-house translators ; and non-local temporary assistance staff .  
In this year in which we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , I would like to lay particular emphasis upon the extremely special nature of this regular contact , an exemplary expression of the close collaboration that should unite the principal organs of the United Nations as they strive to attain the purposes of the Organization .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
Trilateral forms of cooperation between the High Commissioner , CSCE and the Council of Europe will be strengthened in the areas mentioned above through regular yearly meetings , effective and timely sharing of information and the establishment of focal points on human rights issues in each of the respective offices .  
Although there were guard posts at all gates and entry into the compound was limited to those who either held a regular pass or were given temporary passes , bogus passes , which were indistinguishable from the genuine ones , could easily be bought at the Bakara market of the city .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
Other objectives reached have been : the establishment and regular functioning of bilateral working mechanisms with the Government and URNG ; the signing of agreements on security arrangements with each of the parties ; the establishment of close relations with the competent State organs in the area of human rights ; and permanent , flexible contacts with other human rights bodies and non-governmental organizations .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
Owing to the projected increase in air transportation requirements , it is estimated that the usage of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft will be based on a total of regular contract hours included in the rental costs and additional hours provided for extra cost .  
The resources requested for general temporary assistance would secure additional assistance during peak periods of activity or for specific projects , in addition to the normal replacement of regular staff during extended periods of sick leave or maternity leave .  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
Within the framework of existing guidelines , individual technical cooperation activities under the regular programme are determined by the nature of requests received from developing countries , the recommendations of intergovernmental legislative and expert bodies , and the approved work programmes .  
A speaker announced that his delegation was circulating an informal draft decision by which the Executive Board would invite UNICEF to include in its programmes and regular activities , and within the framework of the joint and co-sponsored programme , those of the seven priority initiatives defined at the Paris Summit which fell under its mandate and comparative advantage .  
The Committee had clearly abandoned the question of recommending criteria for determining core and non-core posts with respect to posts to be charged to the support account and those to be charged to the regular budget , having concluded that such an approach might lead to endless controversy and might even complicate debate on other aspects of United Nations financing ; it had been informed that it might soon be seized with the question of core and non-core posts for humanitarian affairs .  
If a separate executive board were to be established for UNFPA , in the light of experience and in line with current practices of the existing Executive Boards , it would need an annual session of 4 to 5 days and three regular sessions of approximately 3 days each , bringing to 14 the annual total number of days needed for consideration of UNFPA matters .  
At its third regular session in 1994 , the Executive Board , inter alia , noted with concern the decreased level of contributions to UNDP and invited Governments to consider increasing their voluntary contributions to UNDP on a more predictable , continuous and assured basis .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
Clearly , desirable levels of effective coordination do not result from the mere creation of joint departments : rather , they should arise from the regular , institutionalized work of combined units set up to monitor public socio-economic policies .  
The causes of the precarious financial situation were plain and followed the same pattern as in previous years , namely late or non-payment of assessed contributions for both the regular budget and peace-keeping operations ; delay between the approval of peace-keeping operations by the Security Council and the receipt of cash to pay for them ; and an increasing number of unfunded mandates . 
" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
I am pleased to annex hereto for your information the text of decision 360 , entitled " Rejection of renewed attempts by the Congress of the United States of America to tighten the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba " , which was adopted on 13 July 1995 at the twenty-first regular session of the Council of the Latin American Economic System , held at the ministerial level in San Salvador , El Salvador .  
The SPF secretariat encourages enterprise sector participation in regional industrial development activities through various measures such as ongoing regular and consultation visits to public and private enterprises , liaison with national chambers of commerce and industry , training seminars and workshops , and provision of technical assistance facilities ( a marketing support fund scheme was set up to provide assistance to new exporters , for example ) .  
In a series of communications addressed , during 1993-1994 , to all States as well as to the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial institutions and the regional development banks , the Secretary-General requested them to provide him , on a regular basis , with information on action taken or contemplated by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States ( see A / 49 / 356 , para .  10 ) .  
It is understood that the meetings of the Working Group during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly would require a specific exception to paragraph 7 of Assembly res - solution 40 / 243 of 18 December 1985 , in which the Assembly decided that no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly might meet at the United Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the General Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly .  
The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made by the meeting of States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
Decides that , owing to these unique and exceptional circumstances , South Africa 's unpaid assessments accruing up to 23 June 1994 for the regular budget of the United Nations shall be considered no longer due and payable , and that the amount of authorized retained surplus in the General Fund pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42 / 216 of 21 December 1987 shall be reduced accordingly ;  
Horrendous atrocities committed by the regular army of Croatia in Western Slavonia and Krajina which resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs , the looting and burning of Serb houses and the expulsion of about 500,000 of them from their ancestral homes , have proved that the main Croatian political goal is to establish an ethnically pure State .  
Many audits identified such problems as private cheques ( even vendors ' cheques ) that were being encashed by the cashiers out of funds in their custody , reconciliations of cash not being performed on a regular basis , old reconciling items not being cleared , cash advances remaining uncleared for long periods and improperly credited cash receipt vouchers .  
It is particularly outrageous that Croatia should blame the Serbs for aggression when it is quite clear that the regular army of Croatia has been guilty of horrendous atrocities committed in western Slavonia , the Krajina and Bosnia and Herzegovina , which have resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs and the burning and looting of their homes .  
NULLThe budget of UNDCP has two separate and complementary parts : the regular budget concerned with treaty implementation and legal affairs ; and the Fund budget supported by voluntary contributions and geared to assist developing countries in drug control .  
If a separate Executive Board were to be established for UNFPA , in the light of past experience and in line with current practices of existing Executive Boards , such a Board would need an annual session of four to five days and three regular sessions of approximately three days each , bringing to 14 the annual total number of days needed for consideration of UNFPA matters .  
The corresponding combined total figures for the regular budget , peace-keeping operations and international tribunals should be changed from $ 1,872,734,590 to $ 1,872,666,930 for the current period , from $ 2,884,441,868 to $ 2,884,374,208 for the grand total and from $ 3,200,852 to $ 3,197,130 for assessments within the 30-day-due period included in the grand total .  
62 The unique capabilities of remote sensing satellites for providing comprehensive , synoptic and multi-temporal coverage of large areas at regular intervals had been and would be an indispensable tool for continuous environmental monitoring .  
The amount of the special education grant for each disabled child is equal to 100 per cent of the revised amount of maximum admissible educational expenses for the regular education grant .  
While the number of exceptions owing to medical conditions decreased by half , exceptions resulting from the unavailability of the regular standard of accommodation exceeded the number for the previous reporting period by 12 cases and exceptions for eminent persons increased by 30 cases .  
The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .  
Account also has to be taken of the consequential demands on the Registry of the Court for research and legal , library and documentary services and , particularly , translation and secretarial services owing to the expanded case-load of the Court and hence office space requirements for additional regular staff and those hired under temporary assistance for meetings and general temporary assistance .  
If the disabled child is eligible for the regular education grant , the total amount payable under the two types of grant shall not exceed $ 13,000 a year ( $ 16,900 if educational expenses are incurred in the United States of America ) unless educational expenses are incurred in designated currencies other than the United States dollar , in which case the maximum amounts shall be those established for each of the designated currencies .

that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in General Assembly resolution 48 / 141 ,  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
These reforms are aimed at achieving the following objectives : first , to improve the Government 's ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of properly trained Malawians to meet professional and specialized manpower needs ; and , secondly , to improve the morale , motivation and work ethic of civil servants through proactive measures , such as the regular review and rationalization of pay and benefits schemes .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
recognizes the need for a stronger and central role for the Fund in surveillance of all countries , in a symmetrical manner , in accordance with paragraph 4 of the communiqu of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the Fund , dated 26 April 1995 , with regard to potential sources of destabilization of capital markets with a view to promoting transparency and stability in international financial markets and promoting economic growth , such surveillance including , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of economic and financial data ;  
In that connection his delegation had reluctantly accepted the failure to establish any of the 27 posts requested by the Secretary-General under the regular budget on the understanding that the number of posts and the level of appropriations under those sections were provisional and would be reviewed during the examination of the support account and that any posts that might be established would be the subject of revised estimates in the context of the first performance report .  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
Take note of the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } position that three elements ( permanent core capacity ; variable capacity to support ongoing missions and additional capacity to support the liquidation of completed missions ) are essential to the effective coverage of backstopping functions at Headquarters ; that the core capacity should be funded from the regular budget ; and that the variable and additional capacity should be funded from the support account ( paras .  NULL  
Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
The Assembly , concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses committed against these women migrant workers , which impair or nullify their enjoyment of their human rights , requested the inter-agency meeting preceding the regular session of the Commission on the Status of Women to consider this problem .  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Invites States concerned , specifically those sending and receiving women migrant workers , to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health , legal and social services for them , adopting specific measures to address these problems , setting up , as appropriate , linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement those measures and , in general , creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of society in which they reside ;  
Professional staff in the Office of the Spokesperson should be assigned departments concerned with major news stories and should attend relevant departmental staff meetings , and receive regular briefings from senior staff in their department of assignment on the public information aspects of the work of the department and important decisions made .  
A number of countries reported that cases against law enforcement officials charged with crimes connected with the infliction , instigation or toleration of any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment were heard by regular domestic criminal courts .  
In addition to the commitment already reflected in section F of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to promote , within the United Nations system , regular intergovernmental consideration of environment and development issues and effective coordination of the relevant United Nations system components , the Working Group recommended that the existing machinery be improved at the global level by , inter alia :  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
Delayed publication of semi-annual financial statements ; elimination of miscellaneous supplemental schedules to the main financial statement ; elimination of preliminary unaudited financial statements for regular budget and peace-keeping budgets at the end of the biennium ; elimination of supplementary annex to technical cooperation report . ( b ) Payments and disbursements .  
I am pleased to report that the efforts to focus attention on this issue bore fruit and on 8 August the Government of Croatia and UNTAES signed an agreement by which the former committed itself to contribute to the regular monthly financing of public services in the region , including health and social welfare , education , police , administration , operating costs and related administrative expenses , in the amount of 4.5-million kunas ( approx . $ 860,000 ) ( see S / 1996 / 648 ) . 
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
At its substantive session in 1996 , the Council adopted resolution 1996 / 36 of 26 July 1996 on follow-up to the major international United Nations conferences and summits , including the implementation of their respective programmes of action , and decided that it should continue to ensure , on a regular basis , the harmonization and coordination of the multi-year work programmes of relevant functional commissions by promoting a clear division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them .  
It has established national committees in more than 80 countries , and through its regular meetings and special seminars has played a major role in the exchange of experience and technical information on the sustainable use and conservation of water in food production .  
The Institute was encouraged by an increased willingness of African States to base their policy decisions with regard to crime prevention and criminal justice issues on appropriate , adequate , valid and reliable data , as has been indicated by several participants of training activities organized by the Institute .

In addition to its influence on the regular programme of work of the Conference , the increase in the number of ECE member countries , which has greatly extended the number of countries in the region in need of technical assistance , has obliged ECE to appoint regional advisers , including on economic statistics , and to seek to provide other forms of technical assistance , such as through a UNDP-funded project in social and demographic statistics .

He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .

Following a comprehensive review of the structure of the Lessons Learned Unit , and a reassessment of its resource needs , the Secretary-General remains convinced that the functions of the Unit can not be met from the remaining two dedicated posts for the lessons learned function financed from the regular budget ( one-D-1 , one General Service level ) following the anticipated cessation on 31 December 1997 of voluntary funding for other extrabudgetary posts currently available to the Unit .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .

Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
In addition , an extraordinary appropriation of $ 1-million was approved by the Governing Council , comprising $ 500,000 for studies requested by the Governing Council for activities directly related to the implementation of improved management and administrative practices by UNEP , and $ 500,000 for the costs associated with the anticipated special session of the Governing Council in the event that these costs are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations .  
Moreover , the Agencys working capital reserves representing the difference between assets and liabilities in the regular budget had been driven to a dangerously low level , so that at the end of 1996 , they amounted only to some $ 5 million , or the equivalent of less than one weeks share of the Agencys normal monthly expenditures of $ 22-million .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Also recognizes that an effective International Monetary Fund surveillance mechanism requires , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of reliable economic and financial data from all Fund members , and in that regard invites the Fund , within its mandate , to explore how data can be gathered from other relevant sources in order to contribute to the effectiveness of its surveillance mechanism ;  
In the final days of the regular session the General Assembly and the presidency responded effectively and played an impartial and constructive role in selecting a Secretary-General when assertive unilateralism provoked deadlock in the Security Council and threatened to undermine the integrity of the institution of the United Nations itself .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
Among them , for example , are the requirements of article 20 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and of article 21 of the statute of the International Civil Service Commission that their respective budgets be included in the regular budget of the United Nations . Another is the question of a legal basis for the United Nations , in the absence of an appropriation , to advance funds to the entities concerned , pending receipt of contributions from the participating agencies . 
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .

More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
Unpaid work in the household and in agriculture , and volunteer work should be measured and valued using improved methods including regular time-use studies , and international organizations and research institutions should provide technical assistance to developing countries in valuing and making visible women 's unpaid work . 
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Therefore , the provisional agenda of the forty-fourth regular session of the Board would focus on the main substantive issues as designated in Midrand , while other procedural matters normally dealt with at the regular session had been allocated to the agenda of the fifteenth executive session to be held in June 1997 , thus considerably freeing the regular session of the Board to focus on the main substantive items and the high-level segment .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
In addition to the regular contacts between the Steering Committee and the relevant international organizations , the multinational protection force Command in Tirana has daily contact through its civil military cell with the representatives of the main international organizations .

Although applying the procedures of an optional protocol would not give the Committee any jurisdictional authority , it would provide an opportunity through regular reports and individual communications to submit useful recommendations to the States parties and would make a major contribution to the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States .

In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The General Assembly has recognized the importance of the collaboration of IOM in those activities by inviting it to participate on a regular basis in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , a group responsible for the formulation of system-wide humanitarian policy and for ensuring that complex emergencies are dealt with through an integrated strategic approach .

At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
The existence within the programme of both normative functions ( funded by the regular budget ) and operational technical cooperation activities ( funded by the Fund of UNDCP ) permits a synergy of action : technical expertise that supports the normative work provides a valuable underpinning for technical cooperation activities , and operational activities provide an important source of experience in putting international norms into practice .  10 .

Gradually I find myself striving to take on more of the traits I admire among my friends in Yunnan-a warm view of hospitality , a greater appreciation of natural surroundings , a resilience to ill fortune and calamities beyond one 's control and more inclination to enjoy to the fullest the good times that inevitably follow .  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
Lai continues : " University gay organizations play an important role in the gay rights movement . However , students graduate and leave , and there are difficulties maintaining communications between schools . In order to achieve vertical continuity of experience , and horizontal integration and mutual support , it is critical to have regular activities for campus homosexual groups to exchange ideas . "  
Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .  
Some even say that light is emitted . In addition , in observing the statistical data , Chen also noted that the electrical currents and electromagnetic waves both have very regular directional characteristics . " This is exactly what is described in The Yellow Emperor 's Canon of Internal Medicine when it speaks of the movement of ' meridian chi ' and ' subtle nutritious chi ' along the 12 channels .  
Facing an uncertain fate , and caught between the northern and southern governments , parliamentarians were unable to hold meaningful sessions , nor could they collect any regular salaries , so it is no surprise that these early parliamentarians , many idealistic to start with , ended up giving in to temptation . There is nothing new under the sun about intellectuals being sullied by the realities of hard-nosed politics .  
With the exception of the Yehliu facility , whose main selling point is cetacean ( whale and dolphin ) shows , most of the older aquariums , in comparison with the new ones , had few regular visitors and only limited fish-husbandry technology . Consequently most relied on short-term exhibits , such as special exhibits of precious marine life held at the lunar new year .  
T'ienti at regular times provides free " cosmic qi healing . " Wearing their " struggle suits " - yellow shirts with blue pants-the envoys of T'ienti first chant the 20-character mantra before turning themselves into mediums that use the " Great Spirit of the Universe " to cleanse their patients ' bodies . From time to time they extend their arms to accept invisible golden pills into paper cups , which their patients wash down with water .  
Born with the proverbial silver spoon in her mouth and well acquainted with the finer privileges in life , she never attended a single day of school in the regular education system , but that has n't kept her from developing into one of Taiwan 's best inkwash artists .  
The term tian wen literally means " the pattern of the skies , " and refers to the systematic study of heavenly events-the waxing and waning of the moon , sunspot activity , planetary movements , the type and color of comets , and the shape and splitting of sunspots . Ancient Chinese astronomers were especially interested in what they called " guest stars , " i.e . a supernova explosion or any other one-off event that did not fit the regular pattern . They carefully noted dates , duration , position , and brightness .  
Zhang noted that students following the Russian textbook would n't complete their study of basic grammar until they had nearly finished high school . Feeling that this was not a good way to raise the standard of students ' Russian , Zhang isolated important and regular structures-things like changing the part of speech of words , the use of verbs , sentence structure and compound sentences-and taught them early on .  
However , the creation of a happier learning environment in elementary school is now running up against the hard reality of regular examinations and competitive pressures to advance in junior high school , which still operates along more traditional lines .  
The students frolic on the wooden floors in sneakers , running , jumping , sitting , lying down . Students are relaxed and there 's a certain kind of warm atmosphere that they might not even find in their own homes . The classrooms at Yung'an are not divided into a single room per class , as at regular schools .  
Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
Currently the weaving class has been held for three terms , and several dozen people have already mastered the basic techniques . The community has also sold looms . It 's just unfortunate that the women of the village , after finishing their regular housework , do n't have very much time leftover . Without any economic motivation , few continue with weaving after taking the course .  
In addition , in 1999 , after the streamlining of the provincial government , city and county chronic disease control offices either were merged with other agencies or discontinued their tuberculosis operations . Medical care for TB gradually shifted from specialist hospitals to regular health care institutions . Some of the highly trained tuberculosis specialists retired , while others left their jobs , or were assigned to other positions . The old TB prevention infrastructure today no longer exists .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
In order to strengthen the tuberculosis treatment network , the Department of Health has made preliminary plans to use Taipei 's Hospital for Chronic Diseases , Taoyuan Hospital , Taichung Hospital , the Center for Chest Disease , and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital as diagnostic referral centers for northern , central , and southern Taiwan , accepting TB patients who have been diagnosed at regular hospitals or whose disease is proving difficult to treat .  
Such plans all emphasize lively and vivid presentation , and putting fun into learning . But the school authorities are also very aware that some parents might think the teachers are " not doing their regular work " or just playing games with the students . For this reason they must first persuade parents to support the approach . Fortunately , the experimental plan is aimed at first-grade students who entered junior high school in 2002 and who do n't yet feel the pressures of academic testing , so resistance is minimal .  
Before that time , all primary and junior high school teachers were trained in specialist teacher training institutions or in the education departments of a small number of regular universities . These students were all government funded , and the government was responsible for their professional placement after graduation . The students were guaranteed lifetime employment , and aside from their professional training , their education emphasized a sense of national spirit .  
In line with the harsh predictions concerning " dejobbing " set forth in the book Jobshift : How to Prosper in a Workplace without Jobs , regular full-time , lifelong jobs with fixed objectives are quickly and quietly disappearing . After being laid off , many individuals are setting up their own private offices . Some do well ; most find themselves vulnerable . Left with no choice , they become security guards , sell insurance , do what they can to earn a couple extra bucks .  
located to the east of tian'anmen square , the museum of chinese history is the first national museum in china with exhibition halls of 8,000 square meters besides the regular exhibition of chinese comprehensive history , special exhibitions on various subjects are often held at the museum  
While the Working Capital Fund is the primary source of reserve capital in respect of the regular budget , its level ( $ 100-million , less amounts required to meet unforeseen expenditures ) has not been changed since 1982 .  
Together with the established posts funded from the regular budget , the continuing posts would serve as the primary resource , providing the minimum level required to sustain the Organization 's peace-keeping activities .  
" Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in civil , political , economic , social and cultural matters , as well as democratic values exemplified by free and regular elections ;  
The compact fluorescent lamps more recently available , on the other hand , provide reasonably attractive light , fit regular incandescent fixtures and achieve an efficiency of 61 lumens per watt , or 3.8 times the efficiency of a comparable incandescent lamp .  
The flat annual fee is then applied to the applicable assessment base which equals the total net assessment for the United Nations regular budget for the year , adjusted for tax refunds .  
Revision of the existing system , which would allow , inter alia , for automatic updating of the scale , with permanent members of the Security Council paying a uniform fixed premium on their regular budget contributions , economically less developed countries benefiting from that surcharge in proportion to their per capita income and economically more developed countries paying the same percentage as towards the regular budget ;  
Previously , the regular programme was divided into three parts : the General Fund per se , funded ongoing activities ( items originally in the General Fund that had received special funding ) and capital and special projects ( investments required to expand and improve the Agency 's capital facilities , and ongoing activities which had received special funding yet which were not part of the Agency 's core activities ) .  
In addition to its regular annual session , during 1994 JUNIC held two ad hoc sessions to develop and coordinate the implementation of joint information activities in connection with the major international conferences scheduled for 1994 and 1995 , and in particular with the World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women .  
In reply to a question on the comparative costs of the various ways of providing translation , the Committee was informed that , in the absence of an accurate cost-accounting system , these could be listed at this stage as follows in the order of ascending costs : contractual translation ; local temporary assistance staff ; regular in-house translators ; and non-local temporary assistance staff .  
In this year in which we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , I would like to lay particular emphasis upon the extremely special nature of this regular contact , an exemplary expression of the close collaboration that should unite the principal organs of the United Nations as they strive to attain the purposes of the Organization .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
Trilateral forms of cooperation between the High Commissioner , CSCE and the Council of Europe will be strengthened in the areas mentioned above through regular yearly meetings , effective and timely sharing of information and the establishment of focal points on human rights issues in each of the respective offices .  
Although there were guard posts at all gates and entry into the compound was limited to those who either held a regular pass or were given temporary passes , bogus passes , which were indistinguishable from the genuine ones , could easily be bought at the Bakara market of the city .  
Based on the information received , the Supreme Court of Justice announced in November 1994 that a special investigation would be conducted , given the failure of an application for habeas corpus and the existence of " sufficient grounds to suspect that ( the individual ) was detained or kept in detention illegally by a public official , members of the State security forces or regular or irregular agents , without disclosing his whereabouts " .  
Other objectives reached have been : the establishment and regular functioning of bilateral working mechanisms with the Government and URNG ; the signing of agreements on security arrangements with each of the parties ; the establishment of close relations with the competent State organs in the area of human rights ; and permanent , flexible contacts with other human rights bodies and non-governmental organizations .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
Owing to the projected increase in air transportation requirements , it is estimated that the usage of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft will be based on a total of regular contract hours included in the rental costs and additional hours provided for extra cost .  
The resources requested for general temporary assistance would secure additional assistance during peak periods of activity or for specific projects , in addition to the normal replacement of regular staff during extended periods of sick leave or maternity leave .  
In this connection , the team wishes to point out that because of the existence of well-equipped regional and international organizations engaged in promoting the process of economic reform in the economies in transition , it would be advisable for ECE to confine the provision of technical cooperation activities to limited priorities which complement its regular programme of work .  
Within the framework of existing guidelines , individual technical cooperation activities under the regular programme are determined by the nature of requests received from developing countries , the recommendations of intergovernmental legislative and expert bodies , and the approved work programmes .  
A speaker announced that his delegation was circulating an informal draft decision by which the Executive Board would invite UNICEF to include in its programmes and regular activities , and within the framework of the joint and co-sponsored programme , those of the seven priority initiatives defined at the Paris Summit which fell under its mandate and comparative advantage .  
The Committee had clearly abandoned the question of recommending criteria for determining core and non-core posts with respect to posts to be charged to the support account and those to be charged to the regular budget , having concluded that such an approach might lead to endless controversy and might even complicate debate on other aspects of United Nations financing ; it had been informed that it might soon be seized with the question of core and non-core posts for humanitarian affairs .  
If a separate executive board were to be established for UNFPA , in the light of experience and in line with current practices of the existing Executive Boards , it would need an annual session of 4 to 5 days and three regular sessions of approximately 3 days each , bringing to 14 the annual total number of days needed for consideration of UNFPA matters .  
At its third regular session in 1994 , the Executive Board , inter alia , noted with concern the decreased level of contributions to UNDP and invited Governments to consider increasing their voluntary contributions to UNDP on a more predictable , continuous and assured basis .  
The estimated shortfall had been revised downward since the second regular session of the Executive Board , largely through UNIFEM having received a higher level of contributions than expected and as a result of beneficial foreign exchange fluctuations .  
Decides that neither partial funding authority nor the operational reserve mechanism will be restored to UNIFEM until relevant control mechanisms have been thoroughly reviewed and new procedures have been put in place that will ensure , inter alia , the accurate calculation and regular updating of reserve levels , and the establishment of a system to provide sufficient early warning of any possible future drawdowns on the reserve ;  
Clearly , desirable levels of effective coordination do not result from the mere creation of joint departments : rather , they should arise from the regular , institutionalized work of combined units set up to monitor public socio-economic policies .  
The causes of the precarious financial situation were plain and followed the same pattern as in previous years , namely late or non-payment of assessed contributions for both the regular budget and peace-keeping operations ; delay between the approval of peace-keeping operations by the Security Council and the receipt of cash to pay for them ; and an increasing number of unfunded mandates . 
" The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
I am pleased to annex hereto for your information the text of decision 360 , entitled " Rejection of renewed attempts by the Congress of the United States of America to tighten the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba " , which was adopted on 13 July 1995 at the twenty-first regular session of the Council of the Latin American Economic System , held at the ministerial level in San Salvador , El Salvador .

In a series of communications addressed , during 1993-1994 , to all States as well as to the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial institutions and the regional development banks , the Secretary-General requested them to provide him , on a regular basis , with information on action taken or contemplated by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States ( see A / 49 / 356 , para .  10 ) .  
It is understood that the meetings of the Working Group during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly would require a specific exception to paragraph 7 of Assembly res - solution 40 / 243 of 18 December 1985 , in which the Assembly decided that no subsidiary organ of the General Assembly might meet at the United Nations Headquarters during a regular session of the General Assembly unless explicitly authorized by the Assembly .  
The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made by the meeting of States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .  
Decides that , owing to these unique and exceptional circumstances , South Africa 's unpaid assessments accruing up to 23 June 1994 for the regular budget of the United Nations shall be considered no longer due and payable , and that the amount of authorized retained surplus in the General Fund pursuant to General Assembly resolution 42 / 216 of 21 December 1987 shall be reduced accordingly ;  
Horrendous atrocities committed by the regular army of Croatia in Western Slavonia and Krajina which resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs , the looting and burning of Serb houses and the expulsion of about 500,000 of them from their ancestral homes , have proved that the main Croatian political goal is to establish an ethnically pure State .  
Many audits identified such problems as private cheques ( even vendors ' cheques ) that were being encashed by the cashiers out of funds in their custody , reconciliations of cash not being performed on a regular basis , old reconciling items not being cleared , cash advances remaining uncleared for long periods and improperly credited cash receipt vouchers .  
It is particularly outrageous that Croatia should blame the Serbs for aggression when it is quite clear that the regular army of Croatia has been guilty of horrendous atrocities committed in western Slavonia , the Krajina and Bosnia and Herzegovina , which have resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs and the burning and looting of their homes .  
NULLThe budget of UNDCP has two separate and complementary parts : the regular budget concerned with treaty implementation and legal affairs ; and the Fund budget supported by voluntary contributions and geared to assist developing countries in drug control .  
If a separate Executive Board were to be established for UNFPA , in the light of past experience and in line with current practices of existing Executive Boards , such a Board would need an annual session of four to five days and three regular sessions of approximately three days each , bringing to 14 the annual total number of days needed for consideration of UNFPA matters .  
The corresponding combined total figures for the regular budget , peace-keeping operations and international tribunals should be changed from $ 1,872,734,590 to $ 1,872,666,930 for the current period , from $ 2,884,441,868 to $ 2,884,374,208 for the grand total and from $ 3,200,852 to $ 3,197,130 for assessments within the 30-day-due period included in the grand total .  
62 The unique capabilities of remote sensing satellites for providing comprehensive , synoptic and multi-temporal coverage of large areas at regular intervals had been and would be an indispensable tool for continuous environmental monitoring .  
The amount of the special education grant for each disabled child is equal to 100 per cent of the revised amount of maximum admissible educational expenses for the regular education grant .  
While the number of exceptions owing to medical conditions decreased by half , exceptions resulting from the unavailability of the regular standard of accommodation exceeded the number for the previous reporting period by 12 cases and exceptions for eminent persons increased by 30 cases .  
The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .  
Account also has to be taken of the consequential demands on the Registry of the Court for research and legal , library and documentary services and , particularly , translation and secretarial services owing to the expanded case-load of the Court and hence office space requirements for additional regular staff and those hired under temporary assistance for meetings and general temporary assistance .  
If the disabled child is eligible for the regular education grant , the total amount payable under the two types of grant shall not exceed $ 13,000 a year ( $ 16,900 if educational expenses are incurred in the United States of America ) unless educational expenses are incurred in designated currencies other than the United States dollar , in which case the maximum amounts shall be those established for each of the designated currencies .

that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in General Assembly resolution 48 / 141 ,  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
These reforms are aimed at achieving the following objectives : first , to improve the Government 's ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of properly trained Malawians to meet professional and specialized manpower needs ; and , secondly , to improve the morale , motivation and work ethic of civil servants through proactive measures , such as the regular review and rationalization of pay and benefits schemes .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
Thanks in part to General Assembly support for the universal principles enshrined in the Charter and in part to the intervention of United Nations peacekeeping forces , the countries which emerged following the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia are now increasingly heading towards the objective of peacefully resolving mutual problems on a bilateral basis and through regular multilateral contacts , thereby lessening the need for international involvement and mediation .  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject relating to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation and to request the executive secretaries of the regional commissions to submit their joint recommendations in this regard to the Council at its annual organizational session ( decision 1982 / 174 ) .  
recognizes the need for a stronger and central role for the Fund in surveillance of all countries , in a symmetrical manner , in accordance with paragraph 4 of the communiqu of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the Fund , dated 26 April 1995 , with regard to potential sources of destabilization of capital markets with a view to promoting transparency and stability in international financial markets and promoting economic growth , such surveillance including , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of economic and financial data ;  
In that connection his delegation had reluctantly accepted the failure to establish any of the 27 posts requested by the Secretary-General under the regular budget on the understanding that the number of posts and the level of appropriations under those sections were provisional and would be reviewed during the examination of the support account and that any posts that might be established would be the subject of revised estimates in the context of the first performance report .  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
Take note of the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } position that three elements ( permanent core capacity ; variable capacity to support ongoing missions and additional capacity to support the liquidation of completed missions ) are essential to the effective coverage of backstopping functions at Headquarters ; that the core capacity should be funded from the regular budget ; and that the variable and additional capacity should be funded from the support account ( paras .

Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,  
The Assembly , concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses committed against these women migrant workers , which impair or nullify their enjoyment of their human rights , requested the inter-agency meeting preceding the regular session of the Commission on the Status of Women to consider this problem .  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Invites States concerned , specifically those sending and receiving women migrant workers , to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health , legal and social services for them , adopting specific measures to address these problems , setting up , as appropriate , linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement those measures and , in general , creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of society in which they reside ;

In addition to the commitment already reflected in section F of chapter 17 of Agenda 21 to promote , within the United Nations system , regular intergovernmental consideration of environment and development issues and effective coordination of the relevant United Nations system components , the Working Group recommended that the existing machinery be improved at the global level by , inter alia :  
These challenges include the completion of the reconstruction and rehabilitation of networks damaged during the wars and occurrences of civil strife that have plagued the region during the past decade ; the standardization of technical specifications , harmonization of border crossing procedures , and removal of non-physical trade and transport barriers ; and the improved maintenance of the existing infrastructure and equipment which is not considered , as is the case in other developing countries , among the priority areas for regular funding .  
The Board recognizes that the transportation and provision of controlled drugs needed for humanitarian aid in acute emergencies of natural or human origin constitute a genuine justification for non-application of the normal , regular control requirements .  
To achieve that end , Iraq and the Special Commission further agreed to conduct regular meetings at the political level every two months in Baghdad to devote attention to fundamental issues , review the progress and direct any further effort necessary to achieve the aforementioned objective .  
Given the rapid pace at which funding from non-governmental sources occurs the current requirement for prior approval of the Executive Board for donations of a value in excess of $ 25,000 is not practical ; nor is there any real need to involve the Executive Board in prior review and approval , when regular reporting provides an adequate basis for monitoring .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
Delayed publication of semi-annual financial statements ; elimination of miscellaneous supplemental schedules to the main financial statement ; elimination of preliminary unaudited financial statements for regular budget and peace-keeping budgets at the end of the biennium ; elimination of supplementary annex to technical cooperation report . ( b ) Payments and disbursements .  
I am pleased to report that the efforts to focus attention on this issue bore fruit and on 8 August the Government of Croatia and UNTAES signed an agreement by which the former committed itself to contribute to the regular monthly financing of public services in the region , including health and social welfare , education , police , administration , operating costs and related administrative expenses , in the amount of 4.5-million kunas ( approx . $ 860,000 ) ( see S / 1996 / 648 ) . 
In addition to the major summit meetings mentioned above , which have proved themselves a flexible and effective format for high-level decision-making , the Central American Integration System ( SICA ) continues to ensure that regional meetings within the institutional and legal framework it establishes are a regular occurrence of Central American political life .  
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
At its substantive session in 1996 , the Council adopted resolution 1996 / 36 of 26 July 1996 on follow-up to the major international United Nations conferences and summits , including the implementation of their respective programmes of action , and decided that it should continue to ensure , on a regular basis , the harmonization and coordination of the multi-year work programmes of relevant functional commissions by promoting a clear division of labour among them and providing clear policy guidance to them .

The European Union has often stated that the crisis can not be resolved until all Member States have agreed to meet their obligations under the United Nations Charter in full by settling their arrears and by paying on time and without conditions the full amount of their mandatory contributions to the Organization 's regular budget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations . 
In addition to its influence on the regular programme of work of the Conference , the increase in the number of ECE member countries , which has greatly extended the number of countries in the region in need of technical assistance , has obliged ECE to appoint regional advisers , including on economic statistics , and to seek to provide other forms of technical assistance , such as through a UNDP-funded project in social and demographic statistics .  
At the informal consultations held on 15 January 1997 at a briefing by UNDCP for permanent missions to the United Nations ( Vienna ) , there was agreement that the bureau of the special segment ( preparatory body ) should be distinct from that of the regular segment ( functional commission ) and should remain in office until the special session .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .

For the present report , data were sought through UNFPA 's network of offices in the developing countries via a concise questionnaire , realizing that , given the small size of UNFPA field offices and the fact that field offices do not have a data-collection function as part of their regular responsibilities , the data gathered would be preliminary and fragmentary in nature .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .

He made it clear in his previous report to the General Assembly that those measures were beginning to have a real impact on the people in the towns , particularly the urban elite , and that they were adding to the suffering in rural areas , where people are often poor and where , owing to the violence and the civil war , regular access to , inter alia , health care , hygiene , various essential goods and primary and secondary education have become even more curtailed .  
However , the ever-growing demand on the United Nations human rights programme to engage in such areas as confidence _ building measures , technical cooperation , education , monitoring , etc . makes it indispensable to establish an adequate and reliable mix of regular budget resources and voluntary contributions from Governments and private entities .  
Endorses Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 48 of 26 July 1996 on new and innovative ideas for generating funds , in which , inter alia , the Council decided that funds generated by new and innovative ideas should not substitute for official development assistance , that they should be distinct from funding the regular budget and the peacekeeping budget of the United Nations , and should be part of global partnership and interdependence and that the role of private investment in financing development should be stressed ;

The Joint Border Commission continues to meet on a regular basis and to focus on resolving the disputed border areas it had previously identified , but the results of its work have thus far fallen short of the expectations and the public statements of intent of the two parties in this regard .  
At the national level , review arrangements , such as the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) - sponsored round-table meetings and the World Bank consultative and aid groups , organized by the least developed countries with the support of the respective organizations , have been further consolidated during the early 1990s , with additional countries joining or rejoining the process and meetings taking place more frequently and on a more regular basis .  
The working group of the Commission on Human Rights which was engaged in the elaboration of a draft optional protocol to the Convention intended to establish a preventive system of visits to places of detention was endeavouring to reconcile various national positions while maintaining intact the basic principles of regular and ad hoc visits to detention centres , participation of experts in missions and the integrity of the text to be adopted .  
Following a comprehensive review of the structure of the Lessons Learned Unit , and a reassessment of its resource needs , the Secretary-General remains convinced that the functions of the Unit can not be met from the remaining two dedicated posts for the lessons learned function financed from the regular budget ( one-D-1 , one General Service level ) following the anticipated cessation on 31 December 1997 of voluntary funding for other extrabudgetary posts currently available to the Unit .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .

Concerning future trends , UNCTADs technical cooperation programme was achieving its goals satisfactorily , and its efforts to cooperate with other organizations were worthy of praise , but two policy questions would have to be addressed : how did the UNCTAD secretariat resolve the apparent contradiction between the concentration of technical cooperation activities in LDCs and its proposals for cost recovery , and how could regular budget expenditures be decreased and technical cooperation activities increased without the implementation of other mandates established at UNCTAD IX being affected ?  
In addition , an extraordinary appropriation of $ 1-million was approved by the Governing Council , comprising $ 500,000 for studies requested by the Governing Council for activities directly related to the implementation of improved management and administrative practices by UNEP , and $ 500,000 for the costs associated with the anticipated special session of the Governing Council in the event that these costs are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations .  
Moreover , the Agencys working capital reserves representing the difference between assets and liabilities in the regular budget had been driven to a dangerously low level , so that at the end of 1996 , they amounted only to some $ 5 million , or the equivalent of less than one weeks share of the Agencys normal monthly expenditures of $ 22-million .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Also recognizes that an effective International Monetary Fund surveillance mechanism requires , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of reliable economic and financial data from all Fund members , and in that regard invites the Fund , within its mandate , to explore how data can be gathered from other relevant sources in order to contribute to the effectiveness of its surveillance mechanism ;  
In the final days of the regular session the General Assembly and the presidency responded effectively and played an impartial and constructive role in selecting a Secretary-General when assertive unilateralism provoked deadlock in the Security Council and threatened to undermine the integrity of the institution of the United Nations itself .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
Among them , for example , are the requirements of article 20 of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and of article 21 of the statute of the International Civil Service Commission that their respective budgets be included in the regular budget of the United Nations . Another is the question of a legal basis for the United Nations , in the absence of an appropriation , to advance funds to the entities concerned , pending receipt of contributions from the participating agencies . 
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .

More specifically , with regard to concerns expressed by the Inspectors , the Secretary-General proposes to follow the policy whereby gratis personnel would not be used to fill posts or discharge functions normally authorized under the regular programme budget , the peacekeeping budget or the peacekeeping support account , especially with respect to political , legal and administrative functions .  
The proposals contained in that report required major non-recurrent capital expenditures on a satellite-based telecommunications network amounting to $ 9.3-million , of which $ 2.75-million represented additional appropriations funded from the regular budget , $ 5.4-million would come from the peacekeeping accounts and the balance would be funded from existing regular budget resources .  There would also have been recurrent costs of $ 8.9 million , of which $ 1.2-million represented additional funding against the regular budget .  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
Paragraph 12 of the report elaborated on the implications of preparing budgets on a full-cost basis , and pointed out that " each budget , whether regular , peacekeeping or support account , should show the complete staffing picture for each organizational unit under review " , and that positions approved by the General Assembly " must be filled in the traditional manner in full compliance with all existing personnel policies and procedures , including the need to maintain geographical balance " .  
Unpaid work in the household and in agriculture , and volunteer work should be measured and valued using improved methods including regular time-use studies , and international organizations and research institutions should provide technical assistance to developing countries in valuing and making visible women 's unpaid work . 
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Therefore , the provisional agenda of the forty-fourth regular session of the Board would focus on the main substantive issues as designated in Midrand , while other procedural matters normally dealt with at the regular session had been allocated to the agenda of the fifteenth executive session to be held in June 1997 , thus considerably freeing the regular session of the Board to focus on the main substantive items and the high-level segment .  
This has been interpreted to mean that the resources approved by the Assembly must be used for staff and non-staff costs as indicated in the relevant budgets and that resources can not be spent from assessed budgets , whether from the regular budget or the budgets of the international tribunals , peacekeeping operations or the peacekeeping support account , in order to utilize voluntary contributions provided by a few donor Governments .  
The question of the applicability of administrative or programme support costs for type II gratis personnel has arisen because heretofore voluntary contributions have related primarily to supplementary or non-assessed activities , but in the context of type II gratis personnel , voluntary contributions are currently linked to activities that have been specified and approved by the General Assembly in the relevant assessed budgets , both regular and peacekeeping .  
In addition to the regular contacts between the Steering Committee and the relevant international organizations , the multinational protection force Command in Tirana has daily contact through its civil military cell with the representatives of the main international organizations .  
With regard to the follow-up to Habitat II , ACC , at its first regular session for 1997 , decided that the arrangements should focus on supporting country-level action and coordination and should involve the development of guidelines to orient the resident coordinator system in establishing country-level thematic groups and strengthening implementation and monitoring at the national and local level .  
However , as the representative of Zaire arrived in New York expecting to present the State party 's initial report , the Committee instead agreed that the representative of Zaire would make an oral report on an exceptional basis on the situation of women in Zaire . The Committee agreed on the understanding that the regular report of Zaire would be rescheduled for consideration by the Committee at a future date .  
Although applying the procedures of an optional protocol would not give the Committee any jurisdictional authority , it would provide an opportunity through regular reports and individual communications to submit useful recommendations to the States parties and would make a major contribution to the campaign against impunity for violations of economic , social and cultural rights .  
Recommends that the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes review and monitor , as a matter of priority and within the context of their regular meetings , their funding schemes , particularly of core resources , with a view to meeting their agreed upon target , reflecting the priorities and needs of programme countries , and increasing the target for voluntary contributions from official sources from the developed countries as the main source for funding of operational activities for the programming cycles , including the present cycle ;  
The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The General Assembly has recognized the importance of the collaboration of IOM in those activities by inviting it to participate on a regular basis in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , a group responsible for the formulation of system-wide humanitarian policy and for ensuring that complex emergencies are dealt with through an integrated strategic approach .

The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .  At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
The existence within the programme of both normative functions ( funded by the regular budget ) and operational technical cooperation activities ( funded by the Fund of UNDCP ) permits a synergy of action : technical expertise that supports the normative work provides a valuable underpinning for technical cooperation activities , and operational activities provide an important source of experience in putting international norms into practice .  10 .  In its resolution 14 ( XXXVIII ) , the Commission requested the Executive Director to indicate the relationship between mandates and budgetary allocations .  
We continue to be concerned at the threat to the fragile marine environment posed by the regular shipment of nuclear and other hazardous waste through the Caribbean Sea .  
There are no regular standards established to gauge the informal economy , which has increased in all countries , and the illegal or illicit economy , which is based not only on drugs , but on contraband , arms and other categories .

Due to their size , most of these Territories are not endowed with natural resources and are subject to regular natural disasters , global warming , desalination of water sources , dependency on few commodities and a high level of emigration .  
Ad hoc requests by international agencies lead to ad hoc data collection , crowding out limited financial and human resources , and thus interfering with regular national statistical programmes ;  
It was projected that at the end of 1998 , combined cash would total $ 528-million , based on regular budget cash of negative $ 247-million and peacekeeping positive balances of $ 775-million .
