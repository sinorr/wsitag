The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
The Technical Meeting sought to move this evaluation process forward , giving emphasis to the necessary immediate and longer-term actions by focusing on four areas : evaluating alternative routes and their comparative costs ; considering bottlenecks in physical infrastructure and ways to remove them ; assessing non-physical barriers to the efficient use of the available transit transport corridors and steps to remove them ; and finally moving towards a framework for future cooperation .

More precise information , available to all parties , would result in far more effective cooperation concerning rates and conditions on existing or proposed alternative routes .  
Keeping open the availability of additional alternative corridors for transit in an uncertain world , even at some cost , as compared with putting more resources into expanding the current most efficient single route , may be the most effective long-term investment and best insurance " policy " for landlocked countries .  
Steps to cut total transport costs will be of real significance to the growth of the Central Asian economies , whether they come about by developing new alternative routes , increasing competition on all routes , improving the quality and efficiency of transport infrastructure and services , or cooperative efforts to reduce waste and inefficiency by installing the most advanced international concepts of transit transport facilitation .  
The continuing convenience of these traditional rail connections stems from the fact that the Central Asian rail lines had been part of the single rail system of the former Soviet Union ( which , in many operating respects , such as scheduling of through trains and the setting of tariffs , continues to function as a coordinated system ) and the fact that the use of some alternative routes has been constricted because of political unrest and because other newer options are only beginning to come on line .  
The Technical Meeting sought to move this evaluation process forward , giving emphasis to the necessary immediate and longer-term actions by focusing on four areas : evaluating alternative routes and their comparative costs ; considering bottlenecks in physical infrastructure and ways to remove them ; assessing non-physical barriers to the efficient use of the available transit transport corridors and steps to remove them ; and finally moving towards a framework for future cooperation .
