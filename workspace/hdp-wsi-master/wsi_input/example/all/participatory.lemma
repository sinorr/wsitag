Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Institutionalize a participatory approach to sustainable urban development , based on a continuous dialogue between the actors involved in urban development ( the public sector , private sector and communities ) , especially women and indigenous people ;  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .  
Stress was also laid on the growing importance which should be attached to the promotion of the rational use of renewable natural resources and environmental protection through participatory strategies which can strengthen communities and facilitate the sustainability of the achievements made .  
In synthesis , the fifth country programme aims at developing , piloting and building within six local impact areas , capacities and systems for a participatory approach to development that will enable the poor to benefit from basic social services , resources and advice necessary for the enhancement of their productivity and improvement of their standard of living .

Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
This entails the need for modernized institutional mechanisms and processes to enable Governments to respond effectively to the complex and changing needs of societies , including demands for viable economic growth , efficient integration of social and economic policies and greater responsiveness and participatory processes .  
The UNV programme has consistently sought to promote participatory processes by using appropriate volunteer modalities , including mixed teams of international and national personnel , and by creating direct linkages between UNV specialists and local populations .

States members of the European Union looked forward to the adoption at the Conference of a statement of principles and a global plan of action which promoted sustainable development through a participatory approach , reflected the positions of all involved in the negotiations and clearly set out the political messages on choices that must be made to meet the challenges at hand .  They reaffirmed their commitment to that objective .  
Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Democratization has enhanced such access and meaningful participation and involvement for civil society actors , and for public-private partnerships ; decentralized , participatory planning and management are important features of a successful urban future .  
This requires , as appropriate , establishing policies , laws and regulations for both public and private activities , encouraging responsible private activities in all fields , facilitating community groups ' participation , adopting transparent procedures , encouraging public-spirited leadership and public-private partnerships , and helping people to understand and exercise their rights and responsibilities through open and effective participatory processes , universal education and information dissemination .

Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
Reaffirming the importance of promoting cooperation among all countries in enhancing the quality of public administration , including , inter alia , the promotion of a participatory approach to development , the provision of basic social services , the development of policies to eradicate poverty and the establishment of an enabling environment for economic growth , social justice and sustainable development ,  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
It should also focus on improved cooperation and implementation by national Governments of bilateral and multilateral forest-related planning activities and programmes , and the use of national-level participatory approaches to that end . "  The Panel also decided to schedule programme element I . 1 for initial discussion at its second session ( Geneva , 11-22 March 1996 ) , and for substantive discussion at its third session ( Geneva , 9-20 September 1996 ) .  
The process should build on national capacity and be based on the following characteristics , considering the situation of each country : well defined linkages to macro-level policies and policy processes ; closely linked cross-sectoral policies and issues , particularly land-use policies ; high-level political commitment and broad-based support ; participatory and decentralized planning approaches , including the use of local knowledge ; and identification and management of conflicts between relevant actors .

In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
With reference to a participatory approach to sustainable human settlements through the development and support of strategies and mechanisms that encouraged open and inclusive dialogue among all interested parties , it was stressed that special attention needed to be paid to minorities .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;

Notes with appreciation the timely production of the new , comprehensive report on the state of the world environment , Global Environment Outlook-1,4 as requested by the Council in its decision 18 / 27 C of 26 May 1995 , as well as the participatory assessment process ( known as the Global Environment Outlook process ) which has been established to support United Nations Environment Programme assessment activities , and its components ( scientific working groups , network of collaborating centres , regional and United Nations-wide consultative mechanisms ) ;  
Indeed , at its nineteenth special session , devoted to the consideration of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly stressed that in order to promote participatory processes in the area of economic and social development , the participation of national legislative assemblies was indispensable .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
The exercise will involve mapping poverty at district and subdistrict levels through an in-depth participatory poverty assessment survey nationwide ; the preparation of national guidelines for community involvement in development activities ; training and institutional strengthening for intersectoral coordination and articulation between central and local governments ; and revamping of the country 's poverty monitoring system for use in decentralized policy and programme evaluation on a continuous basis .  
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The General Assembly acknowledged that " to maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide " ( A / S-19 / 29 , annex , para .  39 ) .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
However , monitoring is basically carried out by governmental and non-governmental bodies which reflect the various interests of the community , given the close and multifaceted links between the institution in question , the President of the People 's Council and the district delegates to the municipal assemblies , who are popular leaders , elected by direct secret ballot ; all of these act as mechanisms for participatory democracy in the community where the institution is located .  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
A deeper participatory role such as they seemed to crave would have been , in our view , wholly inconsistent with their function - to ensure a fair and impartial trial within accepted legal , procedural and evidential principles .  
Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
Through participatory action-oriented research methodologies , data have been collected on the most common practices of a number of indigenous peoples in the Philippines in a broad range of domains , including fishing , farming , traditional handicraft production , and land and natural resource management .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
Two major principles should be observed with a view to ensuring the more effective implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action : first , the planning process should be restructured in order to make it dynamic , innovative , multisectoral , multidisciplinary , responsive , realistic and , above all , participatory ; and secondly , new resources must be allocated to implementing the outcome of the Conference . 
Since 1993 , his Government had been pursuing simultaneously processes aimed at transforming the State , promoting social participation , adapting the production base to the changes in contemporary international life and strengthening democratic and participatory institutions , in the belief that economic development must be compatible with concern for nature and the environment .  
His Government attached the highest priority to efforts to combat poverty and , in that context , sought to increase employment opportunities and improve the quality of life for Bolivians in order to build a modern , decentralized and participatory State through policies favouring citizen involvement , educational reform and privatization of the major public enterprises .  
Peace needs to be considered , not as the absence of differences and conflicts , but as a positive , dynamic , participatory process linked intrinsically to democracy , justice and development for all by which differences are respected , dialogue is encouraged and conflicts are constantly transformed by non-violent means into new avenues of understanding and cooperation .  
This was recognized by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session when it stated , with reference to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development , that transparent and participatory processes should be promoted when integrating economic , social and environmental objectives and that this will require the involvement of national legislative assemblies ( resolution S-19 / 2 , annex , para . 24 ( b ) ) .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .

In addition , a wealth of knowledge can be tapped through a participatory process and strategic partnerships forged at the common country assessment stage , not only among the United Nations system partners , including the Bretton Woods institutions , but foremost with relevant government entities , civil society , including NGOs , and the private sector , as well as other multilateral and bilateral development partners .  
Assessment conducted last year for the 1998 triennial policy review on the formulation and implementation of the country strategy note and the preliminary assessment of the UNDAF process have shown that the essential precondition for the successful implementation of these instruments and thus of effective field-level coordination is well functioning , highly participatory and active country teams .

The purpose of the implementation of the gacaca system of traditional justice is laid out clearly in a recent position paper by the Government , which stated that a lasting solution to the problems of justice in Rwanda can only be achieved by putting in place a system of participatory justice to give an opportunity to the people to bring to light the full truth about the heinous crimes which were committed and to punish those responsible for those crimes .  
Economic growth was strongly correlated with poverty alleviation , and thus the most useful approach lay in the creation of a sound macroeconomic foundation for sustainable growth , with open markets , transparent regulatory systems , strong financial oversight and participatory decision-making .  
At the national level , policies must be developed and implemented in a transparent , democratic and participatory manner that involved civil society .  
His delegation was convinced that the success of all the measures envisaged would be contingent on the restructuring of the international financial and monetary architecture to ensure a more stable and participatory system and the provision of coherent links between finance , trade and development .  
On this basis , European Union support will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Somalia of the IGAD Partners Forum held in Rome on 19 and 20 October 1999 , and of its approach in favour of the establishment of regional governance structures based on participatory processes with the full involvement of civil society , which would provide a foundation for a future national government and for preserving the sovereignty and unity of Somalia .  
The areas identified are education , sustainable economic and social development , human rights , equality between women and men , democratic participation , advancing understanding , tolerance and solidarity , participatory communications and free flow of information , and knowledge and international peace and security .  
Thus we need to set aside the residuals of the bipolar system and replace bloc security umbrellas with a new and innovative concept of global security networking , an inclusive and participatory system which uses the existing mechanisms in a complementary rather than competing scheme .  
The preservation and extension of its achievements , coupled with revitalization of the moral authority and political relevance of the United Nations in the coming millennium , require restoration of the fundamental purposes and principles of the United Nations , as well as a rational , transparent and participatory process of reassessment of the existing institutions .  
These include strengthening the financial and economic architecture at the macro level , while at the national level promoting explicit pro-poor policies , investment in basic social services , participatory strategies and the empowerment of women .  
The fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly has helped move the debate forward by recognizing that good governance is governance that is responsible to the needs of the people , based on efficient , participatory , transparent and accountable public service , policy-making processes and administration .

A participatory democratic political system with transparency and accountability supported by rule of law and efficient administrative institutions , is required both for sustainable development and for dealing positively with globalization forces .  
Thus , it should be stressed that sustainable participatory development would not , then , be fully achieved , as it remains conditional on political , economic and social , environmental and cultural sustainability .  
In order to reach the poorest , mixed teams of international and national UNV volunteers mobilized social groups and assisted local communities through participatory approaches at the grassroots level .  
Rather , it is an ongoing , agreed , systematic and comprehensive participatory process that must become part of the dynamic of national construction in various areas political , economic , social and cultural .

Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Stresses the necessity of establishing , at the national level , an enabling legal , political , economic and social environment for the realization of the right to development and emphasizes the importance of democratic , participatory , transparent and accountable governance , as well as the need for efficient national mechanisms such as national human rights commissions , to ensure respect for civil , economic , cultural , political and social rights , without any distinction ;  
The review revealed progress in a number of areas , including administrative reform and state modernization at the central level , capacity-building within national institutions for humanitarian coordination and community empowerment to promote participatory local development in selected provinces , with special emphasis on youth and women .  
Taking note of the Bangkok Declaration adopted at the tenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( TD / 390 ) which asserted that solidarity and a strong sense of moral responsibility must be the guiding light of national and international policy and that more inclusive , transparent and participatory institutional arrangements for international economic decision-making are required to ensure that the benefits of globalization are accessible to all on an equitable basis ,  
The provision of increased financial resources , inter alia , through innovative approaches , as well as technical assistance and transfer of environmentally sound technology at the international and national levels , was highlighted in the final report of IFF . 8 It was also stated that such support is particularly needed for capacity-building , and for creating participatory and innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable forest management .

Urge those States in which the political and legal systems do not reflect their multiracial , multi-ethnic , multilingual and multicultural realities to review those systems , in consultation with representatives of the affected groups , with a view to improving democratic institutions so that they are more fully participatory and avoid marginalization , exclusion and discrimination of specific sectors of society , including indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other victims of racism ;  
This proposal is based on current UNDP programmes concerned with the rule of law and comprises five main goals : ( a ) national capacity-building in the judicial sphere ; ( b ) support to the participatory process of judicial reform ; ( c ) improved access to justice ; ( d ) consolidation of institution-building in the main bodies responsible for public security , the Haitian National Police and the Prison Authority ; and ( e ) national capacity-building in the area of respect for and promotion of human rights .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
In this respect , it was felt that the role of the United Nations within the system would be effective to the extent that participatory approaches were pursued , and the United Nations built on its role as a forum where the competencies of different agencies could be drawn together and where their respective constituencies were engaged in a dialogue towards common , overriding objectives .  
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
This includes providing assistance in strengthening governance in areas undergoing development that will help to address unstable situations , the judiciary , traditional conflict resolution mechanisms , the cultivation of political will and leadership for peaceful resolution of disputes , the development of conflict resolution skills and practices , consensus-building and public policy dialogue , and the promotion of participatory and inclusive decision-making on central economic , social and political issues .  
We express our deep concern that socio-economic development is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Such a response must be inclusive and participatory and must be based on the complete convergence of the efforts of all relevant actors : Governments , multilateral and regional institutions , the private sector and civil society .  
Communication for development is recognized as an essential element for raising awareness on , and use of services for , promoting informed choices of behaviour and ensuring that households , local communities and especially women and adolescents are involved through participatory approaches in determining problems , identifying solutions , communicating messages , and taking action .  
In addition , the methodology moves away from an expert approach , in which the communication expert produces the communication component of the programme , towards participatory communication planning , where all of the countrys team members ( from government , UNICEF , other United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations ) are involved in the planning , with beneficial results in terms of sharing and learning skills as well as ownership of the final product , which has in itself important implications for the implementation of the strategic communication plan developed .  
Also , the WHO Healthy Cities Programme aims to put health on the agenda of decision makers , build a strong lobby for public health , and develop holistic , popular , participatory approaches to dealing with health issues , bringing together all the development sectors in a strategic alliance in actions that can lead to a health transformation in creating healthy conditions in various physical environments .  
To all the parties to the conflict , political parties and key sectors of civil society in the country : ( a ) that they commit themselves fully and in good faith to the Inter-Congolese Dialogue , avoiding pointless arguments and always keeping their eyes on the goal the establishment of a democratic , participatory system and full respect for civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
Given the deepening interdependence arising from globalization , holistic and participatory solutions should be sought and partnerships among the major stakeholders , donors , recipients and the public and private sector should be strengthened , in line with the initiative of the Secretary-General on the Global Compact .  
The States of the region are asked to undertake to develop and implement national plans of action for human rights covering the entire range of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights , through a participatory process which includes civil society ;  
There is a widely shared expectation that the United Nations can play a vital role in facilitating a transition from war to peace and in enabling the Afghan people to involve themselves actively in an inclusive participatory process through which a comprehensive political plan could be devised and implemented .  
While the emergence of a broad-based and representative government through an inclusive participatory process may take some time , the failure to take the initial interim measures promptly , to meet urgent security needs and to deliver emergency humanitarian assistance could well jeopardize the entire process .  
To implement the strategy , a series of integrated , systemic and phased programme inputs in the political , social and economic spheres are envisaged and interlinked to reinforce each other and to help the Government to achieve three core objectives : accountable and transparent governance within the context of a broad-based participatory political framework ; political and social stability that rests on equity and respect of human rights ; and broad-based economic prosperity .  
Promoting an open , inclusive and participatory approach to setting standards , regulatory frameworks and governance mechanisms for ICT-related activities , inter alia , in areas such as privacy , cyber-crime and commercial and financial transactions drawing on the work under way in a number of international bodies and industrial consortia aimed at developing solutions to regulatory issues ;  
Two subregional and five national training workshops , taking into account the specific characteristics of the municipal systems , specifically on the promotion of community involvement in the definition of priorities and initiatives to reduce urban poverty ; facilitating the formation of social capital through a participatory process , incorporating the most vulnerable groups ; and increasing productivity in municipal investment through integrated programmes and action . 
Creating an efficient environment for and enhancing the effectiveness of social sector investment , including through greater reliance on a participatory local community approach in the design , implementation and evaluation of measures relating to the provision of social infrastructures and basic social services , particularly to improve the condition of the poor members of the community , including through building on deeply embedded traditions of voluntary mutual aid and self-help forms of social capital ;  
The proposals , contained in a document entitled " Transforming Schools into Dynamic and Accountable Professional Learning Communities " which was released in late February , were aimed at increasing the transparency and public accountability of school management and encouraging participatory decision-making by key stakeholders in aided schools .

Although the Parents-Teachers Association ( PTA ) in your school has established good relationship and close connection with parents , I would like to see your parents play an even more active and participatory role in the school so that we can have a more congenial , supportive and motivated learning environment , conducive to quality education .  
Offering Incense , " " Procession , " and " Watching the Show " were all taken in 1935 during a religious festival in Teng 's hometown of Peipu . In the layered effect of the pilgrims in " Offering Incense , " the smoky haze of " Procession , " and the angled viewpoint of " Watching the Show , " Teng takes a participatory yet objective approach , creating expressive , realistic works close to pure documentary .  
We Colombians , for example , have in just a few years achieved significant political , economic and social changes aimed at developing a new democratic century that is more open , more participatory , more pluralistic , more decentralized and more just .  
To enable national and local governments to achieve responsive , participatory administration , efficient service delivery , effective transport provisions , adequate access to open space and recreational facilities , and healthy environments ;  
The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus . 
It must not only resolve a society 's fundamental problems but also promote the full development of the whole individual , with a strong emphasis on economic and social development , social justice and the necessary participation of all citizens in building a civil , pluralistic and participatory society .  
Invites Governments to undertake systematic reviews of each major component of their macroeconomic policy frameworks and to take measures to address any unwarranted disincentives for healthy and progressive informal and small and medium-sized productive sectors , and to create an enabling environment for the scientific and technological community to take initiatives to link technologies , in a participatory manner , with entrepreneurs from those sectors ;  
Institutionalize a participatory approach to sustainable urban development , based on a continuous dialogue between the actors involved in urban development ( the public sector , private sector and communities ) , especially women and indigenous people ;  
In addition , international efforts , such as the Urban Management Programme , in cooperation with multilateral and bilateral agencies , should continue to assist the developing countries in their efforts to develop a participatory structure by mobilizing the human resources of the private sector , non-governmental organizations and the poor , particularly women and the disadvantaged .  
Other major issues related to technological factors in developing countries are ( a ) information as well as misinformation , that is the amount and quality of information on technology , ( b ) efforts on developing participatory types of technology , ( c ) promoting traditional methods , technologies and knowledge , ( d ) basic scientific research , ( e ) financing technology transfer and cooperation , and ( f ) disseminating lessons learned from past experiences .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .  
Stress was also laid on the growing importance which should be attached to the promotion of the rational use of renewable natural resources and environmental protection through participatory strategies which can strengthen communities and facilitate the sustainability of the achievements made .  
In synthesis , the fifth country programme aims at developing , piloting and building within six local impact areas , capacities and systems for a participatory approach to development that will enable the poor to benefit from basic social services , resources and advice necessary for the enhancement of their productivity and improvement of their standard of living .  
Concerning the proposals for action , the Working Group suggested that the Commission consider encouraging countries , with the support of the international community , to prepare and initiate implementation of comprehensive national mountain development programmes and to strengthen national capacity for sustainable mountain development using a participatory approach involving all stakeholders , including local and indigenous communities and non-governmental organizations .  
Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
This entails the need for modernized institutional mechanisms and processes to enable Governments to respond effectively to the complex and changing needs of societies , including demands for viable economic growth , efficient integration of social and economic policies and greater responsiveness and participatory processes .  
The UNV programme has consistently sought to promote participatory processes by using appropriate volunteer modalities , including mixed teams of international and national personnel , and by creating direct linkages between UNV specialists and local populations .  
Sustenance of human resources through the necessary statutory , regulatory , legislative and participatory governance mechanisms that express the ongoing social will to support human resource development ;  
Communities , parents , teachers and students are collectively engaged in a lively and participatory set of educational experiences that focus not only on the basics of education , but also on building self-esteem , motivation and social and collaborative skills relevant to life outside the school .  
By democratization , I mean a process by which an authoritarian society becomes increasingly participatory through such mechanisms as periodic elections to representative bodies , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , and sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
The Panel stressed that all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings and expert consultations in support of the work of the Panel should ensure the transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives as well as a balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
NULLThe Panel recommended to all countries and organizations planning or proposing to organize meetings or expert consultations relevant to the work of the Panel to ensure the open-ended , transparent , participatory and representative nature of such initiatives and the balanced and active involvement of developed and developing countries from all regions and groups .  
States members of the European Union looked forward to the adoption at the Conference of a statement of principles and a global plan of action which promoted sustainable development through a participatory approach , reflected the positions of all involved in the negotiations and clearly set out the political messages on choices that must be made to meet the challenges at hand .  They reaffirmed their commitment to that objective .  
Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Governments of developed and developing countries are now faced with a complex set of external and internal factors , ranging from the strains of adjusting to a new global dynamic to limits imposed by dwindling resources and demands for participatory government .  
The role of public administration must be reviewed if we are to face the increasing complexity of development challenges , such as the eradication of poverty , the growing interdependence of societies , the promotion of social justice and of a participatory democracy , the globalization of the economy , the protection of the environment and the need to increase internal stability in countries vulnerable to civil conflicts .  
Some governments are committed to , and prepared to take responsibility for , improving the capacity of their public administration and civil service and developing policies to promote good governance and participatory development , but lack sufficient means to achieve this by themselves .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
We are therefore encouraged to think that the time has come for the establishment of a new global human order that would be based on respect for national sovereignty , participatory democracy , socio-economic equality , people-centred development and the realization of the economic , social and cultural rights enshrined in the United Nations Charter .  
Indeed , concurrent with the expansion of participatory democracy in many countries , a complex movement has emerged towards autocracy or even totalitarianism at the international level , a trend which is founded on hegemony and flouts justice , freedom , participation , the rule of law , tolerance , human rights , pluralism and democracy in a dangerous and unprecedented manner .  
El Salvador finds itself today on the road to becoming an open participatory society in full development , thanks , among other factors , to its enormous efforts in implementing an ambitious agenda of change and achieving the agreed commitments related to the transfer of land and human settlements , the strengthening of the National Civilian Police , the modernization of the judicial and electoral systems , and the ratification of international instruments on human rights . 
Democratization has enhanced such access and meaningful participation and involvement for civil society actors , and for public-private partnerships ; decentralized , participatory planning and management are important features of a successful urban future .  
This requires , as appropriate , establishing policies , laws and regulations for both public and private activities , encouraging responsible private activities in all fields , facilitating community groups ' participation , adopting transparent procedures , encouraging public-spirited leadership and public-private partnerships , and helping people to understand and exercise their rights and responsibilities through open and effective participatory processes , universal education and information dissemination .  NULL  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
Reaffirming the importance of promoting cooperation among all countries in enhancing the quality of public administration , including , inter alia , the promotion of a participatory approach to development , the provision of basic social services , the development of policies to eradicate poverty and the establishment of an enabling environment for economic growth , social justice and sustainable development ,  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
Only by means of a people-centred , participatory approach will effective transformation of the rural sector occur ; cooperative enterprise is one of the most efficient organizational vehicles for such transformation in developing regions - as it has been in the past when similar conditions existed in the rural economies of currently developed countries .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
It should also focus on improved cooperation and implementation by national Governments of bilateral and multilateral forest-related planning activities and programmes , and the use of national-level participatory approaches to that end . "  The Panel also decided to schedule programme element I . 1 for initial discussion at its second session ( Geneva , 11-22 March 1996 ) , and for substantive discussion at its third session ( Geneva , 9-20 September 1996 ) .  
The process should build on national capacity and be based on the following characteristics , considering the situation of each country : well defined linkages to macro-level policies and policy processes ; closely linked cross-sectoral policies and issues , particularly land-use policies ; high-level political commitment and broad-based support ; participatory and decentralized planning approaches , including the use of local knowledge ; and identification and management of conflicts between relevant actors .  
Recent years have witnessed a wave of democratization at the national level , as an increasing number of countries have adopted multi-party systems , organized free and fair elections and begun the movement towards more open , more participatory societies , frequently with the requested electoral assistance of the United Nations .  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
With reference to a participatory approach to sustainable human settlements through the development and support of strategies and mechanisms that encouraged open and inclusive dialogue among all interested parties , it was stressed that special attention needed to be paid to minorities .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;

The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
Notes with appreciation the timely production of the new , comprehensive report on the state of the world environment , Global Environment Outlook-1,4 as requested by the Council in its decision 18 / 27 C of 26 May 1995 , as well as the participatory assessment process ( known as the Global Environment Outlook process ) which has been established to support United Nations Environment Programme assessment activities , and its components ( scientific working groups , network of collaborating centres , regional and United Nations-wide consultative mechanisms ) ;  
Indeed , at its nineteenth special session , devoted to the consideration of Agenda 21 , the General Assembly stressed that in order to promote participatory processes in the area of economic and social development , the participation of national legislative assemblies was indispensable .  
And from them emerged two key principles of considerable importance : a reaffirmation that international assistance for democratization and reform needs to be tailored to fit into the broader political , cultural and social circumstances of each country , and that good governance is effective , participatory , transparent , accountable and equitable , and promotes the rule of law .  
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
The exercise will involve mapping poverty at district and subdistrict levels through an in-depth participatory poverty assessment survey nationwide ; the preparation of national guidelines for community involvement in development activities ; training and institutional strengthening for intersectoral coordination and articulation between central and local governments ; and revamping of the country 's poverty monitoring system for use in decentralized policy and programme evaluation on a continuous basis .  
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The General Assembly acknowledged that " to maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide " ( A / S-19 / 29 , annex , para .  39 ) .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
The existing mechanisms have demonstrated their effectiveness and are well suited to economic , political and social structures and conditions , while issues relating to children have sufficient political visibility , thanks to the involvement of the entire population through the exercise of participatory democracy .  
However , monitoring is basically carried out by governmental and non-governmental bodies which reflect the various interests of the community , given the close and multifaceted links between the institution in question , the President of the People 's Council and the district delegates to the municipal assemblies , who are popular leaders , elected by direct secret ballot ; all of these act as mechanisms for participatory democracy in the community where the institution is located .  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
For countries undergoing structural adjustment or reform , there is currently a broad consensus that civil society should be involved , that participatory assessment methods should be used , and that departments concerned with social questions , labour , health and others should participate with ministers of finance in negotiations with external donors on strategic policy issues .  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
In following up its implementation at the national level , the establishment of a participatory mechanism facilitating effective and constructive interaction between the private and public institutions ( industry associations , United Nations and other international bodies , non-governmental organizations etc . ) aimed at considering controversial issues and resolving conflicts of interest will be useful .  Such mechanism may have a profound effect in assuring public confidence and providing useful inputs , inter alia , to the Commission on Sustainable Development , the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and other international forums .  
If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
A deeper participatory role such as they seemed to crave would have been , in our view , wholly inconsistent with their function - to ensure a fair and impartial trial within accepted legal , procedural and evidential principles .  
Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
Through participatory action-oriented research methodologies , data have been collected on the most common practices of a number of indigenous peoples in the Philippines in a broad range of domains , including fishing , farming , traditional handicraft production , and land and natural resource management .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
Two major principles should be observed with a view to ensuring the more effective implementation of the Declaration and Plan of Action : first , the planning process should be restructured in order to make it dynamic , innovative , multisectoral , multidisciplinary , responsive , realistic and , above all , participatory ; and secondly , new resources must be allocated to implementing the outcome of the Conference . 
Since 1993 , his Government had been pursuing simultaneously processes aimed at transforming the State , promoting social participation , adapting the production base to the changes in contemporary international life and strengthening democratic and participatory institutions , in the belief that economic development must be compatible with concern for nature and the environment .  
His Government attached the highest priority to efforts to combat poverty and , in that context , sought to increase employment opportunities and improve the quality of life for Bolivians in order to build a modern , decentralized and participatory State through policies favouring citizen involvement , educational reform and privatization of the major public enterprises .  
Peace needs to be considered , not as the absence of differences and conflicts , but as a positive , dynamic , participatory process linked intrinsically to democracy , justice and development for all by which differences are respected , dialogue is encouraged and conflicts are constantly transformed by non-violent means into new avenues of understanding and cooperation .  
This was recognized by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session when it stated , with reference to the 1992 Conference on Environment and Development , that transparent and participatory processes should be promoted when integrating economic , social and environmental objectives and that this will require the involvement of national legislative assemblies ( resolution S-19 / 2 , annex , para . 24 ( b ) ) .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .
