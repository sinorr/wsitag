The promotion of democracy , the strengthening of the protection of human rights and economic and social development formed an interdependent whole , as the World Conference on Human Rights had already stated ; democracy opened the way for the promotion and protection of fundamental freedoms but was able to sustain and consolidate itself only if it was able to respond to the individual and collective needs of citizens .  
At the Vienna Conference on human rights , the international community had recognized that human rights were universal , indivisible and interdependent and had charted a course of action in the field of human rights into the next century ; however , its attention and efforts must be focused on the implementation of all existing human rights instruments , not only so that the perpetrators of human rights violations could be condemned but so that the rule of law should be respected in the future .

In order to support the new global and integrated approach to human rights based on the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , which emphasized the interrelated and interdependent nature of all human rights , it will be necessary to organize both short-term and long-term training in the various dimensions of human rights to ensure that all staff and those joining the Programme enjoy a broad knowledge of human rights from the United Nations perspective .  
Such an action is explicitly called for by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 2 / which in its paragraph I . 5 reaffirms that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing , and with the same emphasis ;

Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " .

Further recalling that in order to promote development equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation , promotion and protection of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and recognizing that all human rights are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , and that the universality , objectivity , impartiality and non-selectivity of the consideration of human rights issues must be ensured ,  
In its paragraph 5 , Part I , the Vienna Declaration and Programme of action recalled that All human rights are universal , indivisible and interdependent and interrelated and , in paragraph 98 , Part II , that to strengthen the enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , additional approaches should be examined , such as a system of indicators to measure progress in the realization of the rights set forth in the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights .  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
Underlying these responses are three basic premises : first , that orderly and planned migration can be a positive force for social and economic development ; secondly , that the long-term manageability of international migration hinges on making the option to remain in one 's country a viable one for all peoples ; and thirdly , that isolated action , whether by an individual State or by a group , can not effectively address what is today a global phenomenon in an interdependent world .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
We agreed on the broadest possible review and modernization of our regional institutional framework , as we were convinced that the benefits of development to which our people are entitled can not be tapped by each country separately they are attainable only to a regional community , because of the dynamics of today 's increasingly interdependent environment .

The cold war , represented by the zero-sum game mentality , where some gain at the expense of others , is giving way to more positive trends and constructive attitudes , driven by the realities of an increasingly interdependent world based on advancing the interests of all .  
Attention should be drawn to the need to strike a balance between the interests of the various States so as to reduce the gap between the excessive well-being of some and the alarming poverty of others , since , in an increasingly interdependent world which shared a common destiny , solutions to environmental problems must be closely interrelated .  
Nicaragua believed that , in an increasingly interdependent world , a permanent , effective , flexible and lasting solution must be found to the debt problem , and that solution must be geared towards economic and social development .  
The developing world expected more substantial capital flows and transfer of technology for social development programmes in order to stimulate development and market access and to strengthen unrestricted competition , which would help to usher in a world with a greater sense of solidarity , which was more interdependent , stable and developed .  
It must be recognized that at a time when economies and societies were becoming increasingly interdependent , as stated by the Secretary-General in the 1997 report on the world social situation , transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting fulfilment of even the national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives ( E / 1997 / 15 , p .  2 ) .

The right to development unifies civil and political rights with economic , social and cultural rights into an indivisible and interdependent set of human rights and fundamental freedoms , to be enjoyed by all human beings , without distinction as to race , sex , language or religion .  
In addition , States are required , by article 6 , paragraph 3 , to take steps to eliminate obstacles to development resulting from failure to observe civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights , because the implementation , promotion and protection of these rights would be essential for realizing the right to development , as all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent ( art . 6 , para .  2 ) .  
The importance of the last element derives from the fact that the right to development is a human right , and as such it is interdependent and indivisible with other civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , in the sense that the denial of any one of these rights would tend to deny the right to development itself .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .
