Now the western region should firmly seize the good opportunity for massive development , formulate a preferential policy , improve working conditions , and step up its efforts to bring in and use qualified personnel ; not only should it fully develop and utilize its own human resources but it should be able to retain qualified personnel and use them creatively ; moreover , it should make positive efforts to attract a large number of qualified personnel from developed areas and even from abroad to work for the massive development of the western region .  
Seizing the opportunity for common development with the western region , the eastern region should formulate concrete measures to actively train and provide qualified personnel for the western region ; it should encourage local outstanding personnel to seek new development in the western region and practically assist the latter in solving problems of want of human resources , instability of the cadre ranks , and an irrational cadre structure and distribution so as to promote the economic and social development of the western region together .  
We are firmly convinced that under the leadership of the CPC , with the support of the people across the country , and giving full play to the superiority of the socialist system , the cadres and people in the western region will certainly be able to use their wisdom and exert themselves to build a prosperous homeland with social progress , a stable life , national unity , and beautiful rivers and mountains .

Addressing a national conference of nationalities affairs commissions on economic work which closed today , Li Dezhu , Deputy Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs Commission , noted : as far as ethnic affairs are concerned , we must be brave in blazing new trails , boldly explore new frontiers , improve the quality of our work , thus make contributions to the large-scale development of the western region .  
Nationalities affairs commissions at all levels must seize the opportunity , always focus on economic construction as the center , proceed from the state 's major political guideline and from the actual circumstances of ethnic areas in the western part of the country , research into the policy and measures for expediting the development of ethnic areas , study specific issues such as reform and opening up , social progress , and key tasks that aim to help impoverished areas , and properly handle the relationship between development and unity .  
At the same time , when we intensify our efforts in the implementation of the natural forest protection project , we should also experiment with the practice of gradually returning the grain plots to forestry and husbandry in a well-planned way , do a good job in protecting and building a sound ecological environment , clothe barren mountains and wasteland with greenery , restore the vegetation cover , and bring gradual changes to the deteriorating ecological environment in the western region .  
discuss and study new ways and new methods for pushing forward the large-scale development of the western region ; summarize and exchange the successful experiences and typical examples that are gained and established by different localities , departments , enterprises , and the masses ; and give shape to a sound environment for opinions and a sound social environment throughout the country , so that both the policy decisions of the central authorities and the gist of Comrade Jiang Zemin 's directives on the work can be put into practice with tangible results .  
In the meantime , the Chinese Government repeatedly issued stern statements to express its determination to adhere to the principle of one China and foiled all kinds of schemes of so-called " dual recognition " plotted by certain anti-China western forces .  With the support of many countries that uphold justice , the United Nations restored the legitimate position of PRC and expelled Taiwan 's representative at the same time .  
We need to focus on the key strategic plans for national economic development , mobilizing the advantage of overseas Chinese resources to the service of the strategies of revitalizing China through science and education and sharply developing western China .  
Dai Xianglong said : Implementing the strategy of developing the western regions is an important plan for restructuring the economy and promoting the coordinated development of regional economies .  It is an important measure for increasing domestic demand and promoting the sustained , rapid and coordinated development of the national economy .  It is also an important opportunity for the restructuring of bank credits and promoting the development of banking .  
Foreign capital and intermediate and long-term credit banks should be supported and encouraged to take part in the development and construction of the western regions , and efforts should be made to achieve breakthroughs in investment forms and operational modes in accordance with the methods for the management of foreign financial institutions .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .  
the western regions have been under large-scale development ; the country 's opening up has been expanding with each passing day ; and the day of acceding to WTO [ World Trade Organization ] is drawing near all these have provided implementing the strategy of national rejuvenation through science and education with a limitless objective demand , an inexhaustible internal motive force , and a favorable external environment .  
Meanwhile , the " Opinions " has also put forward concrete views on how people 's courts can successfully provide a legal guarantee for both the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the development of the rural economy , standardize the financial order according to the law , guard against and avert financial risks , protect intellectual property rights , and provide a guarantee for a sound implementation of the strategy of carrying out a large-scale development in China 's western region .  
By cooperating with and serving others , Chongqing should solve well the problem of redundant industrial structure that is likely to occur during the course of developing the Western Region . By serving others , it should strengthen itself , attain the goal of " striving to turn Chongqing into an economic center on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang put forward by General Secretary Jiang Zemin , and join the western provinces and autonomous regions in building a great economic circle of sustainable development in the Western Region .  
Key topics discussed by the deputies in their speeches were active efforts to seize the great opportunities presented to Sichuan by the development of the western region , exploitation of resources , ecological protection , economic structural adjustment , better incomes for the peasants , and vigorous efforts to develop scientific educational undertakings .  
" The premier 's report sought truth from facts , and highlighted key issues .  We were greatly inspired after hearing the report , " said Deputy Zhang Zhongwei , who was the first to spoke .  " At present , the gap between Sichuan , which is a greatly populated western province , with provinces and municipalities in the east are widening .  
Deputies Chen Dejing , Huang Xuejiu , Zhang Zuoha , and Li Lemin respectively expressed their opinions and made suggestions on the issues of how to strengthen water conservancy construction when developing the western region , development of high and new technological industries ; accelerating the development of educational undertakings in ethnic regions ; and strengthening ecological environmental protection during the development of western region .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : From now on , the stress of aiding the poor through development should be laid on the western region , areas inhabited by minority nationalities , old revolutionary base areas , and utterly destitute area with very poor natural conditions .  It is necessary to take effective measures to step up the work of aiding the poor and to change their straitened circumstances .  
Deputy Abdulahat Abdurixit , chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People 's Government , stated : Large-scale development of western regions has offered ethnic minorities regions ' development with a historical opportunity unknown in the past , while a stable social environment is the prerequisite for large-scale development , for nothing could be accomplished without a stable social environment . 
Linghu An noted : Ever since the central authorities established the strategy on a large-scale development of China 's western region , Yunnan has attached great importance to the work ; regarded and studied its participation in the large-scale development of the western region as a major issue which has a great bearing on the economic and social development of the entire province ; and has drawn up the " Overall Conception for Yunnan 's Action Plan Concerning the Large-Scale Development of China 's Western Region . "  
As regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between China 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in China 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .  All this proves highly beneficial to our efforts to develop the software industry in China 's central and western regions .  
We should make active use of new and advanced technologies , as well as advanced applied technologies , to transform a number of traditional industries in the western region , including the industries of industrial chemicals , building materials , machinery , metallurgy , and light and textile products ; and devote great efforts to enhancing the technological level and the innovation ability of existing enterprises there .  
Proceeding from the special needs of the economic and social development in China 's western region , we should lay stress on the spread and application of improved varieties of agricultural products , dry farming and water-economizing farming , a comprehensive utilization of resources , new materials and new energies , and advanced technologies in the aspect of ecological environmental protection .  
He said : Sichuan Province will seize the historical opportunity brought by the state 's decision on adopting the strategy for great development in China 's west , and will strive to speed up the province 's development at a rate higher than the national average , thus realizing a new leap forward .  The per capita GDP of the province in 2005 will reach the national average level in 2000 ; and will catch up with the national average level in 2010 , thus becoming an economically strong province in the western region .  
Members of the Chongqing delegation had a lively discussion , mainly on such questions as vigorous and scientific implementation of the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region , strengthening of quality education , fostering of the spirit of innovation , development of the economy among the relocated people from the Three Gorges reservoir area , stepping up the efforts to punish corrupt elements , vigorous promotion of urbanization in the western region , acceleration of the reform of the medical and health care systems , and scientifically treating the western region 's advantages in resources .  
In education , special efforts should be made to do a good job in elementary education and in fulfilling the targets of making nine-year compulsory education universal and wiping out illiteracy among the young people and those in the prime of their life .  This is of great significance for improving the quality of people of various nationalities in the western region and achieving the goal of the strategy for the large-scale development of the region .  Special measures should be taken to develop education in the western region ;  
A responsible official of Chongqing Municipality indicated today that this municipality will seize the historical opportunity of extensively developing western regions to build itself into an economic center on the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and will , at the same time , adopt effective measures to ensure the smooth fulfillment of the task on relocating the residents at the Three Gorges reservoir areas .  
He Guoqiang , secretary of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee , answered : Chongqing is the only municipality in western regions as well as the key industrial and commercial city in the southwest region .  The Chang Jiang golden waterways have linked Chongqing to both eastern and western regions .  Thus , Chongqing should serve as a bridge linking the east with the west and making them promote each other .  
Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .  
With a high sense of political responsibility , CPPCC members discussed major agenda , put forward many constructive views and suggestions on the administration of the country according to law , reliance on science and technology to invigorate the nation , sustainable development , great development of China 's western regions , reform of the state-owned enterprise , tackling of poverty , social security , democratic supervision , dealing with corruption , and maintaining social stability .  
Particularly in light of the characteristics in Guangxi where multi-ethnic groups live in compact communities , he pointed out that Guangxi will firmly seize the opportunity of the western development , further solidify the new-type socialist national relationship of equality , solidarity , and mutual assistance , open up a new era of national unity and progress , and create prerequisites for the economic takeoff in the entire autonomous region .  
Faced with the state 's grand development strategy , people in western regions must first of all develop their own line of thinking by completely changing their mindsets ; must avoid the erroneous zone of seeking expanded investment and more projects , of unplanned project startups , and of redundant construction , as characterized during the planned economy period ;  
People from eastern regions participating in the grand development of western regions come with the purpose of " mining the gold . "  As such western regions must have gold that can be mined and must present strong and advantageous points to attract outside capital , technology , management , and personnel .  
The eastern region has its own favorable conditions , and so do the central and western regions .  Therefore , what counts is how different regions can analyze and study their own favorable conditions in a realistic approach , establish a development strategy that suits each 's local conditions , and give a better rein to the existing superiorities while turning potential superiorities into realistic ones as soon as possible .  
The deputies and committee members said : Development of the western region is a major strategic decision made by the party Central Committee facing the new century .  The decision will not only speed up development in the western region , narrow the gap between the eastern and western regions , and boost development of the entire national economy , but also will have a bearing on the achievement of the third-step development strategic goals .  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
First , the western region has obvious advantage in natural resources , such as energy , minerals , tourism , and land .  At present , of the 140 kinds of proven mineral deposits of the country , over 120 are in the central and western region and the deposits of some rare metals there rank first in the country .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
It is necessary to make full use of the unique natural and humane scenic spots and the rich tourist resources with prominent characteristics of the western region to develop tourism for increasing foreign exchange income to promote the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
A pressing task of the moment for all local authorities in the western region is to remove administrative barriers as soon as possible , break up the structure of separating the markets between localities and trades , clear away all obstacles to market entry , and create a unified and open market environment for fair competition , thus grasping the new historical opportunity for the great development of the western region .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
Deputy Li Changchun said : The policy decision on western development reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two overall situations , " and is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demand , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting the coordinated economic development of various regions to ultimately achieve common prosperity , intensifying national unity , maintaining social stability , and solidifying national defense .  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
Recently , the DPRK has actively carried out diplomatic activities ; worked hard to improve and strengthen its relations with the neighboring countries ; readjusted its diplomatic strategies towards the United States and Japan in a timely fashion ; expanded its exchanges with the developing countries ; and further normalized its relations with the western countries with excellent results .  
Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
5 ) After 21 years of rapid growth , China 's comprehensive national strength has been remarkably augmented , the eastern region has possessed considerable actual strength , and the central and western regions have basically resolved the problem of having enough to eat and wear , thus the state and the eastern region are capable of increasing the intensity of rendering support to the central and western development .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
I think that the development of foreign trade in the central and western regions must be combined with the local advantages , take the international markets as their orientation , make best use of their advantages , bypass their disadvantages , exploit their favorable conditions to the full , and form their own unique features .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Recently , the state has promulgated the " Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Granting Preferential Treatment to Foreign-Invested Enterprises Set Up in the Central and Western Regions by Reducing Enterprise Income Tax Rate to 15 Percent in Three Years , " by which the foreign-invested enterprises encouraged by the state to set up in the central and western regions may reduce their enterprise income tax to 15 percent within three years after the current term of the tax preferential policy expires .  This will energetically boost foreign investment in the central and western regions .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .  
To push forward the large-scale development of the western region , all localities are required to act in line with the unified arrangements of the central authorities , carry out their work in a down-to-earth manner , further broaden their vision , and base their work on a higher starting point , stressed Wu Bangguo .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
Today , the curtains of a large-scale development of the country 's western region have already been raised , and the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of cadres and masses is running high .  At such a moment , we should pay close attention to correctly guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm of all sides ; and should bring about a healthy development to the large-scale development of the western region .  
Localities may hold report meetings as they see fit on major issues of major concern to the masses like the state 's economic development , the great development of China 's western regions , the reform of state-owned enterprises and the efforts to help them shed difficulties , and the accession to the WTO , which will help the broad mass of cadres and the masses understand the situation at home and abroad and enable them to deepen understanding of the party 's and the state 's policies .  
At present , party committees and governments at various levels in the central and western regions have come to fully realize their resources advantages for the development of tourism in their areas , and are unifying thinking and making greater determination to take the development of tourism as a major leading industry in the great development of China 's west by doing intensive and down-to-earth work .  
It is necessary to proceed on the basis of resolving currently prominent problems and to have in mind long-term development ; it is necessary to vigorously proceed with the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , to further stabilize and enhance agriculture 's position as the base , to intensify the adjustment of the industrial structure , and to accelerate the grand development of the western region , so as to improve the overall quality of the national economy and to raise the economy to a higher level .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
The land area of the western region accounts for more than half of China 's total , with the arable land accounting for 27.7 percent and grassland three-fifths of the country 's total .  The annual average amount of water resources accounts for 46.6 percent of China 's total .  Together with the abundant sunlight resources , the western region has become China 's major cotton , flue-cured tobacco , fruits , flowers producing bases .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
The western region should energetically develop a pillar industry and competitive products , strive to develop new products , and form an agricultural product processing system focusing on the production of grain and cereal oil products , meat products , fruit and vegetable products , and traditional Chinese medicinal herb products with local distinguishing features and national characteristics .  
It is necessary to make use of the existing funding channels , adjust the orientation of the input of funds and the thinking of building bases , strengthen dynamics in supporting agricultural construction projects in the western region , and focus attention on grasping the building of commodity grain , cotton and sugar-bearing crop production bases as well as dry-land crop and water-saving farming demonstration counties and pastoral area comprehensive development demonstration projects in the western region .  
Chen Yaobang said : Through the efforts of several generations , the western region 's agriculture and rural economy will surely develop in a sustained and steady manner and the goal of building the western region into an agricultural producing region with the characteristics of red flowers , green grass and fragrant melons and fruits will surely be realized .  
Tian Fengshan said : The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources has initially formulated an " outline for development and utilization of land and natural resources in the western region " to ensure that the tapping of minerals and use of underground water will be handled in coordination with the work of ecological protection and returning grain plots to other uses in an orderly manner .  
Tian Fengshan finally told this reporter : In the foreseeable future , the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources will strengthen work in four fields to cope with the needs of large-scale development of the western region : First , we will strengthen the investigation and evaluation of the situation of land and natural resources in China 's western region so as to provide information for economic construction in the western region , especially the rational planning of infrastructure facilities , and to support the harnessing of major rivers , protection of ecological environment and prevention of disasters . 
Zeng Peiyan held : During the third session of the ninth National Committee of the CPPCC this year , CPPCC members posed some opinions and suggestions on the issue of the grand western development , which we highly valued .  We have categorized them and sent them to departments concerned for the research purpose .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
The people in the western region began to examine their past , and quite a few western provinces and autonomous regions have changed their old practice of standing still and refusing to make progress .  They have set up project banks to solicit businesses , established a " single-stop " service structure , and provided fine environment to attract domestic and foreign investors , so as to greet the upsurge of the grand western development in a brand new , open attitude .  
In the early period of new China , given that so many neglected tasks had to be undertaken while we were closely blockaded and encircled by western imperialism , it would have been unimaginable that we could have rapidly healed the wounds of the long period of war and enabled the national economy and various construction work to speedily develop if we had not concentrated finance , material , and manpower to engage in some large undertakings .  
Since the western countries instituted capitalist market economy , pollution , unemployment , and polarization between rich and poor have occurred all the time ; hence their governments have no alternative but to undertake the functions of improving efficiency , regulating income distribution , and stimulating macroeconomic stability and growth .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Chen Jinhua added that the extensive development of the western region is of great significance for expanding domestic demand , boosting sustained national economic growth , promoting the coordinated development of various regional economies , and strengthening national unity .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and Turkey are located respectively at the eastern and western ends of the Asian continent , and Turkey links the Asian and European continents .  It is of great significance that our two countries establish and develop on the basis of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation a new relationship of cooperation and partnership characterized by mutual respect , mutual trust , equality and mutual benefit , long-term stability , and common development .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
After establishing " energy and transportation as key strategic points , " the late ' 80s and early ' 90s saw the inception of huge projects such as the Three Gorges Dam , the comprehensive hydro-power development of the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He River , accelerating development of western oil and central coal fields , and the extension of the Yanlonghai railway line as the " second continental bridge , " among other large-scale projects that concentrated funding in the west .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
The large-scale development of the western region as a major strategic task of the party and the state is now placed in a salient position .  Xinjiang situated along the northwestern border of the country is an important part of large-scale development in the western region , which will have a bearing on the overall situation in economic development .  
The restriction on projects on which restriction must be imposed can also be appropriately relaxed so long as such projects are conducive to the development of the western region and do not affect local environmental protection or the overall situation of national economic construction .  
In China , due to the unbalanced economic development , the central and western areas , where Chinese Moslems live in compact communities , lag behind the eastern areas and are still afflicted with poverty .  
At the same time , in the roadway development for the western region , we must put intense emphasis on ecological and environmental protection and management , protecting cultivated lands , economizing on land use , and industriously integrating roadway development with the improvement of the surrounding environment .  We do this in order to improve the ecology and environment of the west , and to contribute to the enhancement of environmental quality .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
With regard to their penetration channels and means , while vigorously intensifying ideological penetration through traditional means such as newspapers , television , and radio , hostile western forces are continually resorting to new methods , and these moreover are becoming more and more concealed and deceptive .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
We must clearly perceive the political conspiracy and sinister ambition of western hostile forces on the human rights issue , always remain politically sober and staunch , and shoulder our mission of protecting the nation 's security and unity .  
The third stretch is composed of bases on the archipelagoes around Hawaii and on the Midway Island , Alaska and the Aleutian Islands . These bases are the main command center of the Pacific theater and serve as relay stations for the support coming from the western coast of continental United States for the forward bases .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
how are we going to reform the old international political and economic order that is dominated by a small number of developed western countries and to build a new international political and economic order which is fair and reasonable ;  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
Zhou Yongkang said : The " 2000 Western Forum of China " is held under the new circumstances following the adoption after deliberation by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee of the proposal for drawing up the " 10th Five-Year Plan " for national economic and social development ; it is a high-level , large-scale , and highly authoritative international conference with extensive influence as well as the western region 's brand-new form of opening to the outside world under the new circumstances .  
Li Zibin answered : The party Central Committee and the State Council have received a positive response from the people in the western region since they proposed implementing the strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  The vast masses of cadres and people in the western region are determined to seize this opportunity to bring about a leap in economic and social development .  
At present , the people throughout the province have a strong desire and high enthusiasm for making progress and speeding up economic and social development .  We ardently hope to seize the historic opportunity brought about by the state 's strategic decision on making the great development of the western areas to effective fast economic development .  
Let us jointly hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , under the leadership of the autonomous regional party committee and government and by making good use of the vigorous momentum of large-scale western development , forge ahead courageously and create more dazzling new splendors of economic and social development .  
In conclusion , Yang Chuantang said : The people of various nationalities in Tibet are confident in seizing the historic opportunity brought along by the large-scale development of the western region to speed up development , to narrow the gap between Tibet and fraternal provinces and municipalities , and to fulfill the grand objective of entering the front ranks of China 's drive for socialist modernization , an objective set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping .  
The United States also believes that , looking at the balance of forces in the Asia-Pacific region , the western forces headed by itself are overwhelmingly superior , and so the present moment is an excellent opportunity for establishing a constraining multilateral security mechanism under its own control , capable of resolving substantive problems .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
This tragic incident has further exposed the antihuman , antisocial , and antiscientific essence of the " Falungong " cult and pierced through the sham features of Li Hongzhi and western anti-China forces in preaching that permitting the practice of " Falungong " means " upholding human rights " .  
The western anti-China forces have discovered the points in common they have with Li Hongzhi and taken a favorable view of the use value of " Falungong , " and have thus not hesitated to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong in gesticulating and making groundless accusations at the Chinese Government for banning the " Falungong " cult according to law .  
They say the current society and laws must first be destroyed before they can preach their teachings .  On several occasions , Li Hongzhi issued " personal instructions " to practitioners , ordered them to lay siege to government organs and newspaper offices , engaged in illegal gathering and anti-government activities , and served as a pawn for foreign anti-China forces in a vain attempt to play a role that the western anti-China forces have failed to do .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
Faced with the extremely sharp and complicated international struggle , in the past 10-plus years , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core judged the hour and sized up the situation , took the initiative , maneuvered among various states , and defeated western hostile forces ' attempts to disturb us .  Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
maintain sharp vigilance against the attempts of " westernization " and " disintegration " made by western hostile forces , and against the infiltration and erosion of such erroneous ideological trends as " the non-party affiliation of the army " ; resolutely resist the corrosive influence and the attacks of decadent ideologies and cultures ; and firmly defend the authority of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
In 2000 , the Ninth Five-Year for National Economic and Social Development was successfully completed , the development of the western region got off to a good start , and the economy developed in a healthy way .  During that year , China 's democratic and legal systems were continuously strengthened , and its human rights situation maintained a good momentum of development .  
Being the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres , China and Brazil have the duties to play a positive role in propelling the healthy development of the world political and economic situations .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
Over a long period in the past , our economic mode was not diversified , and practice showed that such an economic mode had no vigor and dynamism .  Now , to speed up development , the western areas must develop a mixed economic structure with the publicly owned economy as a main body and with the common development of economies in other ownership forms .  The masses should be mobilized to develop the economy so that the people can get rich when the country becomes powerful .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .  
Most of the grass-roots units of this army unit are situated near the major center of the large-scale development of the western region , where the construction of some Sino-foreign joint venture projects have started with great momentum and to which tourists from afar , as well as Chinese and foreign reporters , are coming in a steady stream .  As a result , in the large-scale development of the western region , the unit has been subject to a grim test in terms of security work .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
It is hoped that implementing the great western development will gradually narrow the gap between the living standards in the east and the west and bring dramatic changes to the troops ' work and living environment as a result , and the masses of officers and men who have planted roots in the west to devote themselves to our national defense will become even more enthusiastic and energetic .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
The western region 's economy is relatively backward , and even for the provincial cities , their economies and tertiary industry are still underdeveloped .  In particular , the troops that are stationed in the tough remote areas practically have no means to set up any kind of society-based safeguard .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
Matters that can be taken over by society should gradually be handed over to society ; security organs with nonmilitary functions should be handed over to the localities , and security organs that shoulder military functions should be streamlined and augmented to create a new logistical security system with operating mechanisms consistent with the Chinese military 's quality construction and the western region 's economic development .  
We must firmly uphold the concept of the whole situation and the concept of long-term construction to actively immerse ourselves in the western great development , work with a will to make the country strong and a spirit of arduous struggle to build an enterprise , and push forward the western region 's military economic construction step by step to make our due share of contribution to raising the country 's comprehensive national strength and increasing our national defense capability .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : In order to encourage enterprises at home and abroad to participate in developing and building China 's western region , the Chinese Government has adopted some preferential policies in the tax revenue sector : The income taxes of domestic and foreign-investment enterprises engaged in industries that are encouraged to develop in the western region by the state will be reduced at a rate of 15 percent within a certain period ;  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
Efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of the central authorities pursuing the large-scale western development strategy , put reconstruction work onto the local governments ' 10th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development and their programs for poverty eradication through development , promote development through the reconstruction efforts , and unceasingly facilitate common prosperity among all ethnic groups .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
The " outlines " puts forward a " three-step " strategy for Tibet 's economic and social development in the coming century , that is , Tibet 's per capita GDP will be in the front ranks of the western region by the year 2005 , will reach the intermediate level in the country by the year 2010 , and will join the front ranks of the country by the middle of this century .  
In coping with external military threats , Russia , which is resolutely opposed to NATO 's expansion to the east , has put forward a proposal for establishing , with European countries , a rapid reaction force to maintain the security of Europe . Moreover , Russia has held many large-scale military exercises with the Commonwealth of Independent States and established a " collective air-defense system " in the western part of Russia .  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .  He hoped that Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles would play a greater role in developing the motherland 's western region and in promoting the common development of Hong Kong and the interior .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
The work of having the 13 eastern provinces and municipalities give support to the development of the 10 western provinces and autonomous regions is an important measure to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two great prospects " to promote coordinated development of regional economy and reduce the economic gap between the east and the west regions .  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
At that time , the entire country of China was in the midst of a crisis of being carved up , and the Qing government was forced to conclude and sign numerous unequal treaties ceding territory and paying indemnities because of its inability to withstand the gunboats and terrific cannon of the western Great Powers .  
All relevant troops , academies , and scientific research units have taken the initiative to contact the stationed areas , understand the technological items urgently needed in local construction , and organize all forces and spare no efforts to engage in research and development of the items .  As a result , some major technological difficulties encountered in implementing the key state , provincial , and city engineering projects in the western area have been resolved .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The western provinces and regions have vast land , great market potential , rich resources , low labor costs , unique comparative advantages , and tremendous development potential .  
This is not only a good method of resolving the issue of a lack of funds , but will also bring in professional human resources , information , advanced technology and management expertise , and scientific marketing networks .  This will promote the enhancement of local products ' quality and the local enterprises ' competitive power in the international market , and will thus bring great benefits to the economic development in the western areas .  
We must closely seize upon the excellent opportunity for strategic implementation of great western expansion and a stable social situation in Tibet , aim for prosperity , progress and long-term stability in Tibet , focus our energy on solving major issues concerning the overall development and stability of Tibet , promote Tibet 's economy from one marked by accelerating progress to one marked by leaps and bounds development , and promote Tibet 's social situation from one of basic stability to one of long-term stability .  
and was an out and out dictator .  He blindly followed western parliamentary and democratic elections in disregard of specific conditions , which caused endless wrangles among parties and factions , continuous upheaval in the political situation , and serious economic losses .  
Our source disclosed that in 1993 , tapes on the execution of prisoners taken from court archives were sold to foreigners by two public security and court officials at the price of scores of ten-thousand yuan .  The tapes were " edited " and combined with documentary tapes on kidney transplants at hospitals and then handed over to the western media for repeated airing just before the International Olympic Committee was about to cast its vote .  The negative impact was so great that it cost China its bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
Today , the center has timely adopted the wise strategy of the great development of the western regions , in order to advance the great development of the western regions where minority nationalities are concentrated .  We should make our contributions to the great development of the western regions , social development , and national unity .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
You have always maintained the true political qualities of being loyal to the party , to the country , to the people and to socialism .  You have resolutely waged struggles against western hostile forces and the national splittists , won great victories in suppressing rebels and bandits and in the self-defense counterattack , forcefully maintained border and social stability in Tibet , and defended our state sovereignty , territorial integrity and national unity .  
The negative impact of economic globalization has not only caused unhappiness in poor countries but has also aroused strong opposition among various social strata such as environmentalists and trade union organizations in the developed countries , with the result that demonstrations against international meetings dominated by the developed western countries have continually escalated in recent years .  
We should play a vanguard role in the building of a spiritual civilization , guide the masses of all ethnic groups to emancipate their minds and renew their concepts , advocate science , and provide a strong spiritual motive power for economic growth in border areas .  We should play the role of a commando in the country 's large-scale development of its western region , firmly establish the thinking that we must develop and bring wealth to border areas while defending and consolidating them ;  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
He expressed hope that local comrades could firmly seize the present rare opportunity of the state 's large-scale development of the western region , make a full use of their advantageous geographic conditions , proceed their work from realistic conditions , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , do their work in a down-to-earth manner , and strive to bring about a faster and better economic and social development .  
Aleksandr Nikolasov , deputy director of the National Economic Forecast and Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , stated : Over the past few years , the Russian Government and industrial circles have attached growing importance to exploiting energy resources in eastern Russia , and with large oil and gas fields discovered and verified in eastern and western Siberia and in Russia 's far east , and proven deposits outstripping future demand in those regions , Russia is bound to increase energy exports by a large margin . 
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
Because of two decades ' rapid and steady economic growth , China 's combined national strength has grown remarkably , enabling it to increase its support for central and western parts of China .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
It is gratifying that , in the western region now , the masses ' enthusiasm for opening up cultivated land on slopes and returning land unfit for grain production to forestry and animal husbandry is running high .  This valuable enthusiasm of the peasants must be seriously protected through such measures as reducing peasants ' burdens , and others .  
We believe that with the wise leadership of the party 's central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly yield good results , and the magnificent ideal of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a reality .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
At present , the State Development Bank has extended loans to central and western regions with a total of nearly 400 billion yuan .  In Gansu , Qinghai and Ningxia , the bank has successively supported state and local key construction projects such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Gas Field , the Lan-Xin Railway , the Daxia Hydroelectric Power State , the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metal Mine , the Ningxia Power Plant , the Qinghai Oil Field and the Lijiaxia Hydroelectric Power Station .  
According to the plan of the China Power Company , in the next 15 years , China will lay stress on developing hydropower plants in the western region .  The goal is to realize " sending electric power from the west to the east " and establish a national joint power supply network .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
The total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in China 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
According to initial revelations , continuing to increase domestic demand , carrying out structural adjustments , pressing ahead with the great development of the western region , deepening reform of state-owned enterprises , stepping up efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and improving the social welfare and insurance systems , will be the vital parts of the report .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
The practice of the omnidirectional opening up has turned the western region to be a forward position and has enabled China to maintain considerably closer economic contacts with the contiguous countries in the north , west , and southwest .  
First , we have been engaged in reform and opening up for more than 20 years , so that the country has considerably increased its economic strength , and the eastern region , in particular , has laid a relatively solid foundation for economic development and is capable of making further advance by mainly depending on its own efforts , thus enabling the country to shift the focus of development to the western region .  
Fourth , after years of development , the western region has initially possessed the soft environment for attracting foreign investment , and more and more overseas enterprises , having realized the enormous potential for the western development , have come one after another to make investment in the western region .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth . 
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .  China has formed a mechanism for socialist market economy .  Our current efforts to develop the country 's vast western region means a great development project under the condition of new science and technology .  
Therefore , the development of the country 's vast western region should be in line with the rule of the market economy , focus on the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and fully utilize the results of scientific and technological progress .  We should carry out a leap-frog-type development project , with a starting point higher than the one we had 20 years ago .  
Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .  Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .  However , the most fundamental thing is that we must rely on ourselves .  Years ago , the development in the eastern region did in a wrong way including redundant construction projects , environmental pollution and the bubble economy .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
Because of two decades ' rapid and steady economic growth , China 's combined national strength has grown remarkably , enabling it to increase its support for central and western parts of China .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
It is gratifying that , in the western region now , the masses ' enthusiasm for opening up cultivated land on slopes and returning land unfit for grain production to forestry and animal husbandry is running high .  This valuable enthusiasm of the peasants must be seriously protected through such measures as reducing peasants ' burdens , and others .  
We believe that with the wise leadership of the party 's central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly yield good results , and the magnificent ideal of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a reality .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
At present , the State Development Bank has extended loans to central and western regions with a total of nearly 400 billion yuan .  In Gansu , Qinghai and Ningxia , the bank has successively supported state and local key construction projects such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Gas Field , the Lan-Xin Railway , the Daxia Hydroelectric Power State , the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metal Mine , the Ningxia Power Plant , the Qinghai Oil Field and the Lijiaxia Hydroelectric Power Station .  
According to the plan of the China Power Company , in the next 15 years , China will lay stress on developing hydropower plants in the western region .  The goal is to realize " sending electric power from the west to the east " and establish a national joint power supply network .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
The total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in China 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
According to initial revelations , continuing to increase domestic demand , carrying out structural adjustments , pressing ahead with the great development of the western region , deepening reform of state-owned enterprises , stepping up efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and improving the social welfare and insurance systems , will be the vital parts of the report .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
The practice of the omnidirectional opening up has turned the western region to be a forward position and has enabled China to maintain considerably closer economic contacts with the contiguous countries in the north , west , and southwest .  
First , we have been engaged in reform and opening up for more than 20 years , so that the country has considerably increased its economic strength , and the eastern region , in particular , has laid a relatively solid foundation for economic development and is capable of making further advance by mainly depending on its own efforts , thus enabling the country to shift the focus of development to the western region .  
Fourth , after years of development , the western region has initially possessed the soft environment for attracting foreign investment , and more and more overseas enterprises , having realized the enormous potential for the western development , have come one after another to make investment in the western region .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth .

Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
Outside construction firms are not allowed to enter local markets ; layers of restriction block the inflow and outflow of personnel ; tedious approval procedures and unreasonable fees : this is how local policies and regulations in western China have built up " sealed walls . "  Since the implementation of development in the west , these walls are now being " torn down . "  
Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
Therefore , the task of narrowing the development gap between the western and eastern regions to bring about regional economic and social revitalization and prosperity can not be accomplished with just one or two five-year plans or a 10-year program .  The task can only be eventually achieved through long-term and ceaseless efforts of many generations .  
Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
In particular , when its features of opposing the KMT 's autocratic and despotic rule and opposing the CPC 's and communism 's deprivation of democracy and human rights emerge , lured by the fragrant " western meal " of " democracy and human rights , " the program is powerfully bewitching and deceptive , and thus gained support and adherents .  
The anti-China activities of " Taiwan independence thinkers " were coordinated with those of western anti-China political forces and human rights organizations , with east and west singing in tune ; they groundlessly labelled the mainland of the motherland as " opposed to democracy and human rights " ; for instance they frequently applied their self-flaunted " democracy and human rights " to abuse the CPC 's opposition to " Taiwan independence " as oppressing Taiwan with " nationalism " and " great Han chauvinism . "  
Of equal importance is the fact that we must use practical and effective measures to deal with the Taiwan authorities in international " human rights above sovereignty " activities .  In particular , regarding the activities they carry out in western countries , we must have a plan for response , we must take initiative , and we must have a definite scope and counterpoint .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
We should deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises ; vigorously develop rural and urban collectives , individual ownership , private ownership , and divers types of other economic ownership ; and groom enterprises into the principal bodies in the development of the western region .  
During his inspection , Li Tieying also listened to reports on Chongqing 's ideas and work on participating in the extensive development of the western region .  In addition , he inspected private enterprises and demonstration areas for national spiritual civilization building , as well as demonstration streets for the national activities against counterfeit goods , the civilization community , and experimental primary schools .  
Li Peng , member of the Standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , stressed at the forum : In developing the western regions , we must properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; ensure a benign cycle for resources exploitation and ecological protection ; and leave our future generations with space for sustainable development .  
We should develop the western regions on a large scale and with firm efforts by proceeding in a planned and orderly way and advancing step by step ; should properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; and should never sabotage ecological environment in this process .  
The remarks of Xin Qi , a Chinese expert on the Taiwan issue , made at a discussion held recently by the Society for the Chinese in western America were reported by a newspaper under an eye-catching title of " Surely attack if independence , and surely win if attacking - - no fear of launching a nuclear war to fight a decisive battle . "  The newspaper also claimed that by voicing the " appalling words , " he will " definitely reinforce his image of commonly deemed the spokesman for the People 's Liberation Army . "  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Actively seek to create the conditions for improvement of the ecological environment of the western area , for improvement of plant and animal products , and for restructuring the agricultural industry .  Introduce superior foreign breeding stock , poultry chicks , seeds , seedlings , and such , into the western area , and give priority technical support to the entry and quarantine inspection of them .  
It is reported that the state has taken the development of forestry in the western region as another strategic priority to the forestry construction .  The State Forest Bureau plans to invest 100 billion yuan in the next 10 years to develop afforestation along the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and the upper and middle reaches of Huang He . Meanwhile , effective measures will be taken to plant trees in closed hillsides and to return cultivated areas into forests in an effort to bring desertification under control .  
While continuing to give play to the advantage of the eastern region , the strategy of the development of the western region will be implemented , the development of the central and western regions will be quickened , and mutual promotion and coordinate development between the eastern , central and western regions will be enhanced with sustained economic growth .  
By the time these cities see an economic takeoff , it is appropriate that the factories in Hong Kong implement its active investment plans , and move their factories which are originally concentrated in southern China to the areas along the Chang Jiang or in the western regions where wages and land prices are comparatively lower , so as to occupy the commanding height .  China is gradually accelerating its efforts of opening up to the outside world .  Hong Kong is a special administrative region under the " one country , two systems . "  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
We must persist in getting some things done and leaving others undone , do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the key points , and concentrate finance and materials on resolving a number of major problems with a bearing on the overall situation of western development , so as to lead forward overall western development .  
Under the present new international and domestic situations , further doing a good job of cultivating and selecting minority cadres is of still greater importance to implementing the guidelines of the 15th national party congress and the central nationality work meeting , putting into effect Comrade Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " smashing the Western hostile forces ' political conspiracy of " Westernizing " and " dividing " China , accelerating the implementation of the large-scale western development , and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
During her recent inspection tour of Guizhou , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , emphasized the necessity of seriously studying a series of important instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on developing the western region , firmly seizing the historical opportunity for developing the western region , further emancipating the mind , changing concepts , boldly using foreign and domestic funds , opening up wider , and promoting development .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .  
She pointed out that while opening up wider to the outside world , the western region should pay attention to opening up to other parts of the country , establishing various kinds and forms of economic cooperation with the developed areas in the interior , supplementing each other 's advantages , making great efforts to develop high-tech enterprises , and jointly developing domestic and foreign markets to attain common development .  
Since early June , the larger part north of the Huang He has experienced a hot weather with hardly any rain .  During this period , high temperatures lasted for several consecutive days in northwest China , north China , northeast China , as well as the Huang He and Huai He regions , worsening the drought that began to break out in north and northwest China in the spring of this year and causing the drought in the western part of northeast China to drastically deteriorate .  
In the next 10 years , it plans to increase the annual extraction volume to 120 billion cubic meters of which 100 billion cubic meters can be set aside for export .  So , with its natural gas reserves , it is capable of providing China with a sufficient natural gas supply which not only can guarantee the smooth implementation of China 's project " to transmit natural gas from the western part of the country to the east " but also can enhance the efficiency of the future natural gas pipeline cooperation .  
In the coming 10 years , Turkmenistan has planned to increase its annual output to 120 billion cubic meters , of which 100 billion cubic meters can be exported .  Turkmenistan has sufficient natural gas reserves to provide China with natural gas .  This not only guarantees the smooth implementation of the project to " send natural gas from the western region to the east , " but also can improve the efficiency in cooperation to lay pipelines in future .  
the people wanted change and wanted progress , and their undertakings were thriving .  She applauded the western great development strategy and the series of policy measures formulated and implemented by the provincial party committee and provincial government , saying they were very much suited to Sichuan and had huge growth potential .  
In deploying this strategic plan , the western region must clearly understand and grasp the international and domestic economic situations , take the changing situations into consideration , adopt the appropriate measures to push their economic work forward , and use expanded opening up to give impetus to development .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
While inspecting the Urumqi-Kuitun Freeway , Ismail Amat pointed out : By standing high , seeing far , and facing up to a new century , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has made such a wise decision as to implement a strategy of developing the western regions on a large scale , this being also a strategic arrangement made by the central authorities for speeding up the development of the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities .  
lay stress on key issues in their work ; rely on their own strength ; and carry out , in a down-to-earth manner , all the principles and policies that the central authorities have formulated for a sound implementation of the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region in connection with both the state enterprise reform and the work of economic structural readjustment .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : The implementation of the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region is of great importance to bringing about a well-coordinated development to the country 's central and western areas ; to strengthening national unity , maintaining social stability , and consolidating border defense ; and also to promoting a sustained , rapid , and healthy [ chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan ] national economic growth .  
Besides , it has also given expression to the essential demand of socialism for an ultimate realization of common prosperity .  Thanks to its abundant natural resources , its sound economic foundation , and its strong scientific and technological strength , Sichuan occupies an extremely important position in the development of the western region .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .  Meanwhile , we have worked out a host of preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the central and western regions , with a view to restructuring the industries and regions that use foreign capital .  
In the face of such a new situation , ever since last year , the DPRK has been taking active steps to readjust its foreign policies .  It has engaged itself in multilateral diplomatic activities ; and has made positive headway in such aspects as improving the North-South relations on the Korean Peninsula , strengthening its relations with neighboring countries , and seeking to promote its ties with both western countries and countries in other parts of the world .

The Japanese personalities attending the meeting universally expressed their admiration for the macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government and the national economy that has maintained a sustained and rapid growth .  They also showed intense interest in the new situation that China will soon accede to the WTO and implement its strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  
He said : Because China will soon join the WTO , is carrying out the strategy of large-scale development of western regions , and , in particular , has registered sustained and steady economic development , Japanese industrial and commercial circles have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for investment in China .  
According to actual conditions , we should investigate and handle cases of abusing power for private gains and claiming and accepting bribes , which may arise in the course of developing the western region ; cases of embezzling , misappropriating , and holding back special construction funds for large-scale development of the western region , major economic losses and accidents due to neglect of duties , cases of transferring state assets , and serious losses of state assets .  
Both economic development and the improvement in the ecological environment should depend on progress in science and technology .  Only through using new science and technology achievements to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech industries , and continuously enabling technology to develop by leaps and bounds will it be possible to gradually narrow the gap between the western region and the developed region .  
The constant improvement in the quality of science , technology and culture of cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups , and the constant increase in the sense of democracy and the legal system and the expansion of the spiritual civilization will create a favorable investment and development environment for developing the western region .  The improvement in such environment itself is a kind of important fundamental construction , which is just as important as the construction of infrastructure and other hardware .  
strive to form a coordinated and complete system of various branches of learning that is closely integrated with local economic and social development ; improve the quality and benefits of running schools ; pay attention to studying and solving major problems in science and technology that have to be immediately solved in developing the local economy while training more capable personnel for the development of the western region ;  
The funds raised through the issuance of this additional government debt would basically be used to accelerate progress in national construction projects funded with national debt .  This includes making up for the inadequate local complementary funds for national debt funded projects in central and western areas of China .  
Both foreign ministers also exchanged opinions on increasing bilateral cooperation in the fields of information technology industry , environmental protection , developing China 's western region , and cracking down on transnational organizational crimes .  They reached consensus of opinion extensively .

The existing industrial foundations , technological capabilities , rich natural resources , and superiority in labor resources in the central and western regions will provide favorable conditions for foreign businesses to participate in the cooperative development of China 's central and western regions .  
While making positive contributions to economic development and social progress in countries in which they settle , overseas compatriots have supported China with great enthusiasm in many aspects : With their advantages in capital , technology , and talent , they have actively participated in the great practice of China 's reform and opening up and in the implementation of the strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  They have played a leading role and served as a bridge in China 's exchanges with foreign countries .  
During the first half of the year , State Council counsellors focused on the central work of the Party and the government , responding enthusiastically to the call from the CPC Central Committee for the " large-scale development of western China . " Eight separate groups made arduous journeys to the midwestern region - - particularly to frontier areas and poor areas - - to conduct survey studies , writing a number of high-quality research reports and making excellent suggestions , which won the high regard and full affirmation of leading comrades in the State Council .  
A vehicle carrying explosives set to be destroyed suddenly exploded around 1938 hours on 8 September when traveling on Xishan Road in the western suburbs of Urumqi , killing 60 people , injuring 173 others , and damaging more than 20 motor vehicles and houses nearby .  
The pipeline will be more than 4,000 km long , running through nine provinces and autonomous regions in the western , central and eastern regions .  The total investment for its first-stage construction , including the building of some down-stream auxiliary projects , will be 120 billion yuan .  
In order to enable the people 's congresses to further play their leading role in the building of legal system and provide perfect legal protection and better service to the large-scale western development , the " Seminar on Large-scale Western Development and Legal System Building " was held in Chongqing this morning , which was attended by the personalities in charge of the standing committees of the people 's congresses from various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipality in western China .  
Thus , doing a good job of the building of legal system for the western region and using the legal system to lead , standardize , promote , and ensure the large-scale western development is the internal requirement of the socialist market economic development , the concrete practice of the general principle of administering the country in accordance with the law , and the inevitable choice that conforms to the trend of economic globalization as well .  
In this respect , it is necessary to release the enthusiasm of both the central and local authorities .  With regard to the laws and regulations , some of them require the unified legislation by the state , and others need to be considered by various western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipality according to the state 's laws , the administrative laws and regulations , and the central policies in light of the local realities .  
Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory , we should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , be bold in practice and courageous in exploration , correctly understand and take advantage of the special characteristics and law governing the building of legal system for the large-scale western development , do a good job of this building in a conscientious and effective way , and make appropriate contributions to the large-scale western development with our own highly fruitful work .  
We should adapt ourselves to the new situation of developing socialist market economy and to the development of international and domestic markets under the new conditions of deepening reform and opening up wider , consider the reality of the western region , strive to explore new concepts , new mechanisms and new methods , base ourselves on the present , aim at the future , do what we are capable of step by step , and ensure an orderly , rapid and highly efficient proceeding of the large-scale development of the western region .  
First of all , we should do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the priority tasks , concentrate our financial and material resources on solving major problems that concern the overall development of the western region , and promote a comprehensive economic and social development .  
In deciding on relevant projects , it is necessary to give overall consideration to economic benefit , social benefit and ecological benefit so as to bring about a coordinated development of natural resources , ecology , economy , population and society in the western region .  
To Effectively control the population scale is conducive to relaxing the pressure of the population on the weak ecological environment and the economic and social development , to improving the population quality and structure , and to increasing manpower and capital of the western region .  It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and the sense of urgency of correctly handling the relationship between development and population control .  
On the one hand , the state will continue to pursue an expansive fiscal policy and issue additional treasury bonds ; the technical-transformation projects supported by the state will be carried out step by step .  In addition , investment in the western region will increase , enterprises will recover their confidence in investment , and an internal driving force for promoting the growth of investment will be gradually strengthened .  
In order to meet the requirements of China 's development of the western region , Wan Xueyuan , director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs , said here today that China 's hiring of foreign experts in the coming year will be focused on the development strategy of the western region .  We will draw the experience of foreign countries in regional development and implement the project of guiding intellectual resources to the western region .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , Wan Xueyuan said , we should enormously attract qualified personnel from the eastern region to participate in the economic construction and development of the western region , and also attract people from other countries , including Chinese students studying abroad and foreign experts .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , the Chinese Government will hire foreign experts focused on the pillar and special industries in the western region .  Both the central and local governments will offer support and preferences in the form of increased expenditure and subsidies .  
Wan Xueyuan said the " transmission of oil from the west to the east " would be a symbolic project in China 's development of the western region in the 21st century .  Meanwhile , the booming special industries in the western region , which include the rare earth industry in Inner Mongolia , the development of herbal and biological medicine in the western provinces , and tomato and safflower processing in Xinjiang , all badly need intellectual support .  
Wan said that the grand occasion of international personnel and intellectual exchanges held in Xinjiang is a specific manifestation of the Chinese Government preparing personnel resources for implementing the strategy of developing the western region and implementing the project of guiding intellectual resources to the western region .  
The central mountain range runs from north to south , splitting Taiwan into east and west parts , and troops can only be deployed in the western part , in an area of under 10,000 square km .  
Second , as Anhui is the first stop in the industrial transference from the eastern region to the western region , we should take the initiative in receiving the radiation of the eastern region to develop our primary industry , and also spin-off projects and enterprises with certain technical content , good market prospects , and powerful pulling force to settle down in Anhui . 
The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting a few days ago to conscientiously study the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech on the grand western development , stressing that the propaganda , ideological , and cultural fronts should resolutely carry out the strategic arrangements of the central authorities , show concern for the grand development , conduct propaganda on the grand development , give support to the grand development , stress political awareness , concentrate energies on implementation , bring real drive into full play , and do practical things for the grand western development .  
Jiang Zemin said that western development is a vast systems engineering , which is related to developing our vast land and also involves the production and daily life of the multiethnic masses ; it has to promote economic construction , and also achieve coordinated economic , resource , population , cultural , and environmental development ; there are very many strands to this work , which is very complex and arduous .  
Centering on this major topic of discussion , the members of the Central Committee will discuss various issues , such as adjusting the economic structure ; quickening the pace of reforming state-owned enterprises , the administrative management structure , the organizational structure , and the personnel system for cadres ; and putting forward concrete plans for finishing infrastructure construction in western China and transforming the ecological environment .  
They emphasized that in this significant period of advancing toward the new century , we should fully exercise the functions of the state power organs in our work , persist in enacting the law for the people , safeguard the fundamental interests of the people , do a good job in inspecting law enforcement and local legislation , and create a favorable legal environment for the grand development of China 's western region .  
The Ma Lai incident shows that during the 19th century Catholic missionaries took advantage of the imperialist gunboat policy to do all kinds of evil things in China , bully the Chinese people , cause incidents , and act as foot soldiers in scheming war against China , after which the western powers used the " missionary case " to launch a war of aggression against China and force it to sign an unequal treaty .  
In recent years , the Chinese Government has transcended the old pattern of regional economic development and formulated an overall approach for the development of central and western China in all dimensions , including construction of facilities , protection of the ecosystem , industrial adjustments , and advancement in science and technology and education .  The Ninth Five-Year Plan period has become an important phase in which China 's strategy of coordinated development of regional economy has fully rolled out and achieved initial successes .  
In September last year , the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee unequivocally put forward the strategy for the vigorous development of the west country , creating a powerful driving force for the development of central and western regions .  Economic cooperation and coordinated development on a nationwide scale will also take place at a higher and more comprehensive level .  
According to an analysis by an authoritative department , the highlights of the achievements made in the coordinated development of regional economy in China under the Ninth Five-Year Plan include the significant acceleration of economic development in central and western regions and the continuous emergence of economic " bright spots . "  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
The industrial structure in central and western regions has also shown a tendency toward optimization , with the quality of economic operations significantly enhanced .  In the first four years under the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the relative size of the secondary industry in central and western regions steadily expanded ;  
As the industrial structure continues to be optimized , the level of coordination and cooperation between central-western regions and the eastern part of the country will also be continuously upgraded ; the traditional mode of interaction between the resource supplying bases and processing bases will be broken down ; and all-dimension exchanges in capital , technology , human resources , and information will take place between the eastern and western regions .  
The export growth forecast for various regions in the first half of this year indicates that export in central regions grew by nearly 32 percent , exceeding the growth level of less than 28 percent in eastern regions .  The export growth rate in western regions also reached 27 percent , close to the comparable level in eastern regions .  
Recently , Japan 's business circles have expressed their optimism in the correct macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government to maintain the sustainable and rapid growth of the national economy and have shown keen interest in the new situation of China 's imminent entry into the WTO and its implementation of the strategy of developing the western region .  
The fact that such a large number of world economic magnates will assemble under the banner of developing China 's vast western region suffices to prove that the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision to develop the western region is wise , well-timed , and full of great potential .  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
He indicated that he hopes that both sides will actively open up new areas of cooperation and new approaches to cooperation to bring economic and trade cooperation between the two countries to a new level .  In particular , the development of western China , new and advanced science and technology , and environmental protection , etc . , may become key items in mutually beneficial cooperation in the future .  
The state will very soon publish the favored treatment measures for supporting the great development of west China , including intensifying the shift of fiscal expenditure and construction funds , speeding up the pace of reforms and opening up in the western regions , and encouraging foreign businesses and other regions of China to invest in the west , and so on .  
The development of the eastern regions has been and remains an extremely important force in supporting the overall national economy in finance , material , and technology , and is also an indispensable condition for supporting the western development and the accelerated development of central and west China .  
According to the report , the " substantive " steps made in the large-scale western development since the beginning of this year include : Formulating and introducing the unified policies for the western development , losing no time in drafting the overall plan for the western development , carrying out the work to accelerate infrastructure construction , speeding up the work of ecological environment protection and construction , and intensifying the scientific and technological and educational work , among other things .  
In the meantime , the report points out that this year , the state has focused on 19 projects to be selected as the demonstration projects of high-tech industrialization in the western region , in a bid to support the local environmental protection , ecological construction , and transformation of advantageous resources for value appreciation , with the total investment amounting to nearly 2.4 billion yuan .  
The great development of the western region requires the combination of the government 's macroeconomic control and regulation with the functioning of the market mechanisms , and requires active exploration of new ideas , new methods , and new mechanisms for the development of the western region , which will be carried out and pushed forward in an orderly way with priority given to selected key fields . 
Through painstaking efforts made by several generations , in the middle of the 21st century , while the whole nation has basically realized modernization , the western region will be also usher in a new look of economic prosperity , social progress , unity among all ethnic groups , stability in people 's livelihood , beautiful natural environment , and richness enjoyed by the people . "  
He held that Shanghai-based Japanese-funded enterprises have accumulated sufficient strength to expand their market in China 's hinterland .  He said : Central and western parts of China are rich in natural resources and in inexpensive labor force .  Being close to Central and West Asia , central and western parts of China can serve as a springboard for Japanese enterprises to expand their market in Central and West Asia .  
New ideas are needed for development . we must persist in advancing strategic economic restructuring , promote the two fundamental shifts , deepen reform , and open wider to the outside world ; we must promote technological innovation and industrial upgrading , carry out the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region , and solve problems accompanying our advance through development .  
Xiang Huaicheng stressed at the session that regular Sino-US summit meetings have laid a foundation for bilateral cooperation .  The recent meeting in New York between President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton promoted the further development of Sino-US relations .  Xiang Huaicheng gave briefings on the main content of the Chinese Government 's Tenth Five-year Plan and on its strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  
Jiang Chunyun pointed out : Implementing the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region is an inevitable requirement for ensuring the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our national economy and fulfilling the third-step strategic objective of the country 's modernization drive .  
The local people 's governments at all levels should adopt preferential policies for , offer financial support to , and step up supervision and management of the work of vocational education and training for demobilized servicemen and may also accept and settle in a planned way and in light of the needs of developing the western regions on a large scale some outstanding professional personnel among demobilized servicemen in the western regions . 
It is necessary to turn this agricultural demonstration zone into a national arid and semi-arid farming technological research and development center , an agricultural technician training center in the western region , a scientific and technological achievements conversion and industrial center , a center for breeding good strains , and an agricultural science and technological information spreading center .  
We should seek great breakthroughs in breeding and develop through selection a number of farm crops of high yield and fine quality and improved animal and poultry strains that are suitable for farming and breeding in the western region ;  
These organs should resolutely oppose and resist local and departmental protectionism , overcome the situation that laws are executed on an optional basis , and handle in a timely manner the economic dispute cases emerging in the process of the western development .  
Shaanxi is rich in resources and has a good industrial foundation , and its scientific , technological , and educational levels are in a leading position in the country ; with good transport facilities , it is apparently in an advantageous position geographically ; it has a brilliant future in reform , opening up , and the large-scale development of the western region .  
Politics and law departments in eastern China are urged to enhance mutual support and coordination with their western counterparts , help their counterparts strengthen material equipment building , improve their work , and help promote the simultaneous development of the political and legal work and economic construction in western regions .  
Through conducting in-depth investigation and study and earnest inspection and argumentation , the provincial party committee and government has elaborately formulated a development plan and proposed to build Sichuan into an economically powerful province in the western region in China as well as an ecological defense for the upper reaches of the Changjiang River through making efforts for 10 years and realize a coordinated economic and social development .  
Sichuan has actively implemented the strategic policy decisions of the central authorities regarding the " great development of the western region , " and has put forth the overall working idea of building Sichuan - - with 10 years of struggle - - into an economic powerhouse province in China 's western region and an ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang , of harmoniously developing the economy and society , and of realizing new strides . 
In the past 10 years and more , the trade deficits of advanced western countries such as the United States and the EU have been continually increasing , and following the establishment of the WTO , traditional trade protection methods such as quotas , licensing , and other non-tariff means have been strictly constrained , hence antidumping means aimed at protecting national industries have been frequently applied .  
All localities must persist in buying the peasants ' surplus grain at protected open prices , attach great importance to lightening the peasants ' burdens , vigorously promote the strategic restructuring of agriculture and rural economy , actively and steadily develop small towns , and achieve relatively rapid increase of peasant incomes.We must push the major development of west China in a thoroughly sound way .  The western development is a major decision of the CPC Central Committee for taking on the overall situation and facing the new century .  
The circular said : Currently and in the near future , the key tasks in implementing the policy of the great development of the western region are : speeding up infrastructure construction , stepping up ecological and environmental protection and building , strengthening agriculture 's position as the basic industry , adjusting the industrial structure , developing tourism featuring special attractions of the western region , and developing science and technology education and cultural and public health work .  
At present , China 's sandy-soil area comes to 1.689 million square kilometers , accounting for 17.6% of the territory in China and forming a sandstorm belt starting in the Tarim Basin in the west and extending to the western part of the Songnen plain in the east .  It runs 4500 kilometers from east to west , and 600 kilometers from north to south .  
While avoiding project duplication and prohibiting the transfer of backward technology and without causing environmental pollution , we shall take strong measures in a number of areas including investment , budgeting , taxation , credit , trade , industry and commerce , labor , and statistics to support enterprises in east and central China in pursuing cooperation with the west by investing in and building factories in the west , buying shares in western enterprises , acquiring or merging with western enterprises , and transferring technology to western enterprises .  
Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Chengguo said : From now on , the coastal areas and outskirts of large and medium-sized cities in east China will mainly be engaged in the production of cash crops with a high value-added and specialty farm produce for export ; the central region will lay particular emphasis on giving play to its advantages in producing premium grain , special-purpose grain , and feed grain ; and the western region will return the grain plots to forestry and husbandry and vigorously develop ecological agriculture .  
Zeng : The implementation of the large-scale western development strategy to accelerate the development in the central and western regions is a major policy decision made by the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core as it looked far ahead from a high plane , took the entire situation into consideration , and oriented the development toward the 21st century , which is of momentous economic and political significance .  
The introduction of these policies and measures is conducive to increasing fund input for the western development , improving the environment for investment in the western region , opening the western region still wider to both foreign and domestic investors , and giving greater support to the development of science , technology , education , and the training of talented personnel in the western region .  It will certainly produce an important effect in pushing forward the implementation of the large-scale western development strategy in a positive and orderly way .  
Zeng : Since reform and opening up , tremendous achievements have been scored in the economic and social development in the western region , but quite a few problems still exist , which are primarily manifested in the weak infrastructure facilities , inadequate irrigation works , few highway and railway networks , backward power grid construction , and low telephone popularization rate . 
Zeng : In putting the large-scale western development into effect , we should take reform and opening up as a powerful dynamic , make positive exploration , be bold to bring forth new ideas , deepen economic structural reform , and quicken the pace of establishing and perfecting the socialist market economic structure ;  
Zeng : To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should be adapted to the trend of economic globalization and China 's upcoming accession to the WTO , seize the opportunity of opening up still wider to foreign and domestic investors , enlarge the spheres of investment by foreign businessmen , broaden the channel of using foreign capital , make positive use of foreign loans , vigorously develop foreign economic relations and trade , and expand economic and technological exchange and cooperation with various countries in the world including the neighboring countries .  
To put the large-scale western development into effect , we should also adapt our work to the requirements of instituting and perfecting a nationwide unified market system , seize the opportunity of opening to the domestic sectors , break down regional barriers , smash departmental and industrial monopoly , further open the markets , and encourage and support enterprises in the eastern and central regions to make investment and operate business in the western region .  
In short , we should vigorously facilitate the rational circulation and optimum allocation of production elements to ensure that material , financial , and human resources are turned to best account and bring into full play the role of markets and resources at home and abroad in the large-scale western development .  
We should infiltrate scientific and technological progress into various links of the western development , expedite the dissemination of advanced applicable technologies , take great pains to develop a number of industrial technologies of a general character , and lay special stress on developing a number of new high technologies with special characteristics .  The state 's funds for various scientific and technological plans should further slant toward the western region so as to provide powerful support and guarantee for the western development .  
At the NPC Standing Committee 's request , the arrangements and utilization of long-term treasury construction bonds have focused on expanding domestic demand to spur economic growth , promote structural readjustments , and lay a solid foundation of the country 's long-term development .  Projects already underway were given priority , and preferences were given to the central and western regions , especially the west .  
The large-scale project to return grain plots to forestry and pasture is being implemented in the western region as a permanent solution to the adverse ecological conditions in the west .  Some 70 million mu of cultivated land with a slope of more than 25 degrees in the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and the upper and middle reaches of Huang He will all be returned and planted with trees and grass .  
Feasible and effective measures should be adopted according to the specific conditions of various areas and industries .  Priority should be given to the central and western regions of the country , the main grain producing areas , and areas where peasants ' income remain at a low level .  It is necessary to stop the downward tendency in peasants ' income as soon as possible .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
It is learned that in the great development of the west , the state will delegate more extensive authorization to manufacturing enterprises in the western region to engage themselves directly in foreign trade , and will adopt a series of favorable policies to encourage the exports of good-quality and marketable products and the undertaking of overseas construction contracts and labor cooperation projects .  
All this will definitely provide various business opportunities for Hong Kong . For example , Hong Kong may raise and provide funds , financial services , and other relevant professional service for the development projects in the western part of China , and may directly launch investment projects there as well .  The local advantages in the interior areas may be used in cooperative production , and the products may be exported and directly shipped to domestic markets in other areas .  
Li Hongzhi , however , who has thrown in his lot with western anti-China forces , has refused to give up his evil designs ; he has repeatedly disseminated his fallacies of " ascend to heaven on consummation , " " go beyond forbearance , " and " cause blood to flow , " and hoodwinked and incited " Falungong " diehards who are mentally controlled by him to make a reckless move , not even stinting to being content that " Falungong " addicts should die in order to reach his unspeakable political goals .  
To address the relatively tight power supply caused by Guangdong 's rapid economic development , Li Peng said : Guangdong should continue to do a good job in launching supporting projects to " bring electricity from western to eastern China , " and expedite restructuring of the electric power industry by " separating power grid management from power plant management " and by " introducing competitive prices for power distribution . "  
Through competition between the same trades at home and abroad , our investment climate will improve further and our domestic markets will completely be open to the outside world .  The government on the mainland is sparing no efforts to create conditions for encouraging investment in the central and western regions .  Under these new circumstances , Hong Kong businessmen in the mainland will face issues such as how to expand and upgrade themselves , how to shift their orientation to high technology and additional high value , and how to carry out a new regional distribution program .  
Speaking on Tibet 's international ties , Lhaba Pingcuo said : Ever since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy , Tibet has opened itself even wider to the outside world .  Tibet has rich natural and tourist resources and its infrastructure is improving .  After the Chinese Government adopted the strategy of developing central and western China in a big way , Tibet is replete with business opportunities .  
Observation team members briefed some 20 overseas Chinese representatives on China 's policy regarding the development of its western regions as well as their economic , scientific , and technological structures , the distribution of natural and human resources , and other characteristics and strong points , adding that the development of China 's western regions serves as an opportunity for them to display their talents , hoping that they will introduce advanced French science , technology , and management to these regions .  
When referring to the economic characteristics of China 's western regions , observation team members said : Western regions ' economic structure is simpler than eastern regions ' , so it is easier to adjust .  Western regions are rich in mineral , zoological , botanical , and tourism resources .  Sichuan and Chongqing have good educational , scientific , and technological personnel .  
The development environment over the next five years suggests that the 10th Five-Year Plan will be implemented against a backdrop that is entirely different from the backdrop to all previous five-year plans - - one that is characterized by China 's impending accession to the World Trade Organization , the growing trend toward economic globalization , the close integration of domestic and foreign markets , a world swept up in a knowledge-based economy and a new technological revolution , and the launching of the strategy of developing western China on a massive scale .  
For this reason , during the 10th Five-Year Plan period , we will expedite the construction of major projects of overall significance , including those aimed at bringing gas and electricity from western China to eastern China , diverting water from southern China to northern China , establishing national strategic petroleum reserves , and building a rail line into Tibet .  
It is necessary to strengthening public health work in rural areas , more effectively prevent and control the incidence of major diseases , infectious diseases , and endemic diseases .  In particular , public health guarantee capacities in the western part of the country must be enhanced .  Reforms of the medical insurance system for urban workers , institutional reforms of the medical institutions , and the reform of the pharmacy circulation system should all be further advanced actively .  
Local cadres and masses are determined to seize the current favorable opportunity of the large-scale development of the western region and to make a good use of the support extended to Tibet by all parts of the country , open ourselves wider to the outside world , introduce investment from abroad and establish lateral ties at home , and actively boost our economy by putting into good use our advantages in natural resources .  
Over the past year , ever since the beginning of the large-scale development of the western region , the people of the entire county have made use of this rare opportunity , laid a solid infrastructural foundation , and stepped up their cooperation with coastal areas in the country 's eastern region .  As a result , our advantage of having rich natural resources is being turned into a practical economic advantage .  
It should continue to play its role in radiating its influence to , and catalyzing the development of , inland regions , take an active part in the extensive development of the west country , support the development of central and western regions , and make greater contributions to nationwide economic development , social stability , and nationality solidarity .  
The western region is rich in coal , oil , natural gas and other resources and has tremendous potential for development .  If efforts are made to improve the transportation , telecommunications , water conservation , and other areas of the infrastructure in the western region , the strong points of the region will be brought into play and this will lay a solid foundation for its long-term development .  
3 ) start 12 new and major projects , including the Qinghai-Tibet Railway , diverting gas from western China to eastern China , returning grain plots to forestry and grassland , and educational projects , with a total investment of 300 billion yuan ;  
The western areas should proceed from their actual conditions , make full use of the preference policies of the state in shifting more financial input to the western areas , more effectively implement the strategy of " relying on science and education for national regeneration , " first make substantial developments in the fields of science and technology , education , infrastructure construction , and ecological environmental construction , and thus lay a solid foundation for comprehensive economic development and social progress in the future .  
CPPCC committee member Li Guozhang said : The forming of a benign investment environment in the western part of the country is subject to restraints in six aspects , namely , the institutional restraints , the policy restraints , the restraints from the backward conditions of science , technology , and education , the restraints from the slow advance of the economic restructuring , the restraints from the out-of-date ideas , and the restraints from the transformation of the government functions .  
Li Peng said : The NPC Standing Committee must conscientiously exercise supervision over budgets and economic work in accordance with the law ; it must investigate , study , and put forward proposals on current major issues in the economic and social spheres , such as strengthening the status of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy , increasing farmer income , reforming state-owned enterprises , increasing job opportunities , implementing the strategy of developing western regions on a massive scale , joining the World Trade Organization , and implementing the strategy of seeking sustainable development .

It is necessary to promote development through opening up , to always persist in implement the strategy of opening to the outside world to bring along economic development , and to raise the level of our work in using resources at home and from abroad and both the international and domestic markets .  We should cater to the domestic market and seize business opportunities ; we should advance both east and west and make it possible for the eastern and western regions complement each other with their own advantages .  
The Chinese government has long been aware of the widening gap between the rich and the poor , and has already adopted a number of preventive measures : First of all , the strategy of developing the country 's western region on a large scale , which aims to promote the economic growth in backward areas , has been put into effect for nearly two years .

We should continue the work of helping poor areas through development and formulate new plans to help poor areas .  We should lay stress on helping poor people in central and western regions resided by minority people , in old revolutionary base areas , and in border and especially poor areas .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out : " A very important reason for China 's backwardness after the 15th century was that China 's feudal rulers closed the door to international intercourse , indulged in parochial arrogance , and could not stand the development of world science and technology , with the result that the Chinese nation sadly missed its historic opportunity , " " and fell far behind the western countries , with the result that it encountered defeat after defeat at the hands of the powerful ships and cannon of the western powers . "  
While talking about all these work results , the NPC deputies and CPPCC members also pointed out : We must pay close attention to the problem of an unbalanced growth among different areas during the course of the country 's economic development , and must help minority nationality areas broaden their way of thinking on the issue of developing their economy .  During the process of implementing the gist of the central authorities concerning the large-scale development of the country 's western region , we must lay special stress on achieving tangible results .

This was due largely to the development of an El Nino in the year , which was characterised by above normal sea surface temperatures in the equatorial eastern and central Pacific . The associated change in atmospheric steering flow caused tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific to turn towards the north before entering the South China Sea . 
The competitions , comprising Open and School Categories , will be divided into 16 sections and 93 classes .

" Wonderful World of Tie-dye Girls " is a dance drama rich in ethnic colour , unique in conceptualisation and innovative in execution .  By using the famous tie-dye craft of western Hunan as the framework , and incorporating the five steps of the tie-dye process - spinning , weaving , tying , dyeing and rinsing - as well as the life of the female workers into the fabric of the story , these hardworking , kind-hearted and intelligent women are portrayed as the creators of in life and beauty .  
Eighty per cent of Taiwan 's highway traffic is concentrated on the long western plain . The existing west coast highway , which carries 80% of the north-south bound traffic , will not be able to meet the demands of future transportation and of balanced economic development .  
The annual investment in major construction projects has totaled more than NT $ 10,000 million . However , being located on the earthquake belt in western Pacific , Taiwan is subject to frequent tremors . The National Science Council recognized the importance of seismic research in preventing and reducing earthquake damages .  
The freeway extends from Keelung , the northern port of Taiwan , traversing through the lush and densely populated narrow western plain of the island to the southern port of Kaohsiung .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
As a result , fast food stores in both western and oriental styles have sprung up all over the main cities to meet the public demand for reasonably priced meals served speedily in hygienic and attractive surroundings .  
Covering an area of 163 kilometers on the western coastal plain , Taichung 's location has aided economic development of the city .

The Chinese have a wide variety of small wrapped or stuffed foods similar to western dumplings or ravioli . Many tend to be sweet or rich , their preparation often time-consuming . Chicken Thread Wonton , however , is light and nutritious , as well as easy to prepare .  
The fundamental elements of western civilization , from columnar architecture , the aesthetic proportions of the human form and humanistic drama to geometric theorems , democracy and the theory of absolutism , all had their origin in the art and culture of ancient Greece .  
Ideally speaking , the doctor should have knowledge of western medicine , and a dialectic base in Chinese physiology and pathology . Then a complete checkup of the patient can be done . Physicians with more than three years of clinical experience are better skilled .  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street . It was thought that plutocratic influences or the pressure of interest groups might prevent real " grass-roots " opinions from being expressed ; so opinion polls were developed .  
I would like to express my personal appreciation of the two books I requested when subscribing to the magazine , In search of Photo Past ( , ) which offer the western reader beautiful , realistic and moving pictures of Taiwan life , the quality of which has seldom been equaled in photographic publications .  
Offshore to the east lies the longest coral reef in the western hemisphere . Most of the mountains are covered with dense primeval forests , home to more than 500 species of birds and thousands of varieties of butterflies . There are sanctuaries for jaguars and baboons and some 600 sites of the ancient Mayan civilization , making Belize a paradise for naturalists and anthropologists alike .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
Trying to say that a given number is either auspicious or ominous is mere superstition . Still , unlike the western sensitivity to the number 13 , Chinese have a whole philosophy built up around numbers , which is spread or experienced in real life .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
Therefore , despite the fact that most of the people active in his books come from overseas , and his discussion of nativist matters is deeply imbued with western style thought patterns , he establishes a dialectical relationship with his theories ( phenomena ) and readers through his alluring and noble prose , the many levels on which his work can be understood , and his clear and persuasive method of reasoning .  
Except for a thin stretch of western Taiwan 's coastline settled by Chuanchow and Changchow Fukienese and a few Pingpu indigenous peoples , Shen was welcomed only by deep , forbidding mountains . The Han Chinese living on the coast called these " Fanshan , " or " savage mountains . "  
In 1987 , he finished a survey of the western section of the Ching dynasty Patungkuan Trail over Mt . Yushan , and uncovered many sections of well-preserved Ching stone paving . At the site of a Ching military camp , he collected numerous fragments of blue and white porcelain crockery , which were identified by the National Palace Museum as products of the Dehua kiln in Fujian Province .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
Looking back in history , the entire area starting from Taipei 's Po-ai District - - where the Presidential Palace and other national governmental buildings are located - - and radiating out to Taipei 's western and southern districts , used to be named Dajiala . In the earliest period of Taiwan history , it was said to be the hunting grounds of the Ketagalan and an official site for worshipping their ancestors .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
Lee Su Yue , herself having lived in a foreign land , has always been greatly touched by the story of the lonely and brokenhearted Wang Zhaojun , who was married out to a barbarian chieftain of the western hinterlands and buried in an alien country .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Because the royal Li family of the Tang dynasty were descended from western and northern minorities , the Tang dynasty was deeply influenced by their culture , and the hunks of the Tang dynasty were all tall and broad-shouldered with strong physiques . These energetic men were excellent riders , archers , martial artists and swordsmen .  
In this way , the western part of the Southeast Asian littoral came within China 's sphere of influence . Furthermore , there were great profits to be had . Each expedition set out laden with silk and porcelain , to be exchanged for rare and precious commodities from overseas , and this too helps to explain why Zheng set sail on seven separate voyages .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
But what many people do not know is that in 1941 Kukeng experienced another major earthquake , which struck the Chiayi-Tainan area . The western face of a 1200-meter high mountain collapsed and fell into the Chingshui River . It formed a natural dam 100 meters high , and created a new lake , Lake Tsaoling , with a volume of 12.86 million cubic meters .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
One experience I will never forget . At Easter , we traveled to the western regions of Queensland . We departed at 4 a.m . and drove past wheat farms , corn farms , crossing a huge broad land , from tall bush to short scrub , from gray-yellow land to bright red . It was fantastic !  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Back in the days when cities relied on rail transport , train stations were catalysts for commercial development . But thanks to Changhua 's geography , while the nice plain to the east of the station became a thriving commercial and residential area , the western side stayed so quiet you can just about see tumbleweeds roll past .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .

This blockade is being accompanied daily by heavy artillery shelling and murderous air-raids which have resulted in numerous casualties among innocent civilians in southern Lebanon and in the western Bekaa and caused considerable material damage .  
The loss of life , the destruction of property , the disruption of the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians living in the western Beqaa and South Lebanon now seriously aggravated by the interdiction imposed by the Israeli naval blockade on thousands of fishermen to carry on their only gainful activity , are all acts of blatant Israeli defiance of the precepts of international law and Security Council resolutions 425 ( 1978 ) , 426 ( 1978 ) and 509 ( 1982 ) .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr .

Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .

It is expected of the international community to respond to the biggest ethnic cleansing carried out so far in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , following Croatia 's brutal aggression against the Serb Krajina and after joint Muslim-Croat attacks on traditionally Serb ethnic territories in western and north-western Bosnia , even after a cease-fire agreement was announced .  
The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .

"  
As regards the level of higher education , there exists no wide gap between China 's central and western regions and its eastern region , and the absolute number of graduates in China 's central and western regions is a considerable figure .

Delegate Zhou Benli said Anhui , although a central region province , should also seize opportunities and accelerate its own development to take part in the grand development of China 's western regions .  Anhui should not only step up infrastructure construction and accelerate the pace of structural readjustment but also effect the spread and transfer of industrial sectors in a selected way , cooperate with western regions to do well in ecological environment protection and construction , implement the strategy of " marching to the east and west , " and energetically develop the market .

Faced with the state 's grand development strategy , people in western regions must first of all develop their own line of thinking by completely changing their mindsets ; must avoid the erroneous zone of seeking expanded investment and more projects , of unplanned project startups , and of redundant construction , as characterized during the planned economy period ;  
People from eastern regions participating in the grand development of western regions come with the purpose of " mining the gold . "  As such western regions must have gold that can be mined and must present strong and advantageous points to attract outside capital , technology , management , and personnel .  
The eastern region has its own favorable conditions , and so do the central and western regions .  Therefore , what counts is how different regions can analyze and study their own favorable conditions in a realistic approach , establish a development strategy that suits each 's local conditions , and give a better rein to the existing superiorities while turning potential superiorities into realistic ones as soon as possible .  
The deputies and committee members said : Development of the western region is a major strategic decision made by the party Central Committee facing the new century .

[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
First , the western region has obvious advantage in natural resources , such as energy , minerals , tourism , and land .  At present , of the 140 kinds of proven mineral deposits of the country , over 120 are in the central and western region and the deposits of some rare metals there rank first in the country .  
Xinjiang 's oil and cotton have initially become its advantages .  Fourth , the western region can absorb the valuable experience accumulated in the practice of foreign trade and economic cooperation in the coastal areas of the eastern region to constantly improve and develop its environment and conditions for foreign trade and economic cooperation and to speed up the formation of an opening-up economy , thus saving a lot of time and energy for opening up wider to the outside world and for developing its economy .  
It is necessary to make use of the unique ecological resources of the western region , strengthen the building of the ecological environment , focus efforts on developing agriculture with special characteristics , water-saving agriculture and ecological agriculture , and promote the processing of agricultural products to increase their added value so that more agricultural products will be sold to the international market .  
It is necessary to make full use of the unique natural and humane scenic spots and the rich tourist resources with prominent characteristics of the western region to develop tourism for increasing foreign exchange income to promote the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation .  
A pressing task of the moment for all local authorities in the western region is to remove administrative barriers as soon as possible , break up the structure of separating the markets between localities and trades , clear away all obstacles to market entry , and create a unified and open market environment for fair competition , thus grasping the new historical opportunity for the great development of the western region .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
Third , we should bring into full play the roles of the existing assets stock of the military industry in the western region , vigorously push forward the readjustment and the strategic restructuring of both the industrial structure and capability of the western region , take the initiative to incorporate the military industry into the economy of the western region , and step up the work of extricating enterprises from their difficulties as well as the establishment of a modern enterprise system .  
It is true that in comparison with the coastal areas in the country 's eastern region , the western region has a relatively lower industrialization level and an irrational industrial structure on the whole , and its gap with the eastern region has been further widened ever since the beginning of reform and opening up ; however , the central cities in the western region , such as Xian , Chongqing , Chengdu , and Guiyang , as well as certain industries and trades still maintain each 's own relative advantages .  
Deputy Li Changchun said : The policy decision on western development reflects Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two overall situations , " and is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demand , precipitating the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting the coordinated economic development of various regions to ultimately achieve common prosperity , intensifying national unity , maintaining social stability , and solidifying national defense .  
To respond to the call of the grand western development , the provincial party committee and government are prepared to adopt the method of the " government putting up the stage and enterprises acting on it , " organizing and leading the enterprises having advantages to expand their businesses at low costs in the central and western regions with their own product brands , production lines , and funds , and help the hinterland develop its economy .  
In his " Government Work Report , " Premier Zhu reiterated this idea of the central authorities .  That is why Guangdong should step up the structural adjustment , enhance the level of opening to the outside world at a faster pace , heighten the economic quality and competitiveness , and quicken the tempo of development .  This effort itself is the powerful support to the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development .  
The people of the entire province , from top to bottom , must take this important four-point instruction as a powerful dynamic and ideological weapon to promote their work in various fields and to put into effect the party central committee 's policy decision on the grand western development with actual deeds .  
Recently , the DPRK has actively carried out diplomatic activities ; worked hard to improve and strengthen its relations with the neighboring countries ; readjusted its diplomatic strategies towards the United States and Japan in a timely fashion ; expanded its exchanges with the developing countries ; and further normalized its relations with the western countries with excellent results .  
Shi Guangsheng : There are many comparative advantages for foreign economic and trade development in the central and western regions .  1 ) They have noticeable advantages in the areas of natural resources including energy , minerals , tourism , land , and so on ; in some areas , they even have unique advantages that other regions do not possess .  
5 ) After 21 years of rapid growth , China 's comprehensive national strength has been remarkably augmented , the eastern region has possessed considerable actual strength , and the central and western regions have basically resolved the problem of having enough to eat and wear , thus the state and the eastern region are capable of increasing the intensity of rendering support to the central and western development .  
through the introduction of foreign capital and advanced applicable technology and equipment , they can speed up enterprises ' technological transformation and industrial structural upgrading , heighten the international competitiveness of the central and western regions , and transform the development potential into realistic productive forces , so as to provide an even broader space and gigantic propelling force for the sustained development of the central and western regional economy and their foreign economic relations and trade in the new century .  
I think that the development of foreign trade in the central and western regions must be combined with the local advantages , take the international markets as their orientation , make best use of their advantages , bypass their disadvantages , exploit their favorable conditions to the full , and form their own unique features .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
Recently , the state has promulgated the " Notice of the State Administration of Taxation on Granting Preferential Treatment to Foreign-Invested Enterprises Set Up in the Central and Western Regions by Reducing Enterprise Income Tax Rate to 15 Percent in Three Years , " by which the foreign-invested enterprises encouraged by the state to set up in the central and western regions may reduce their enterprise income tax to 15 percent within three years after the current term of the tax preferential policy expires .  This will energetically boost foreign investment in the central and western regions .  
Various provinces , autonomous regions , and Chongqing Municipality in the central and western regions are permitted to select a completed development zone in the capital cities to apply for the establishment of a national-level economic and technological development zone ;  
at the same time , these development zones need to have more macroscopic guidance and assimilate the successful experience from the coastal development zones , so as to become the experimental plots and windows for the grand western development and opening up , and play the role of demonstration , radiation , and contribution in the business solicitation and foreign capital importation for the entire central and western regions .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .  
To push forward the large-scale development of the western region , all localities are required to act in line with the unified arrangements of the central authorities , carry out their work in a down-to-earth manner , further broaden their vision , and base their work on a higher starting point , stressed Wu Bangguo .  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
Today , the curtains of a large-scale development of the country 's western region have already been raised , and the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of cadres and masses is running high .  At such a moment , we should pay close attention to correctly guiding , protecting , and bringing into play the enthusiasm of all sides ; and should bring about a healthy development to the large-scale development of the western region .  
Localities may hold report meetings as they see fit on major issues of major concern to the masses like the state 's economic development , the great development of China 's western regions , the reform of state-owned enterprises and the efforts to help them shed difficulties , and the accession to the WTO , which will help the broad mass of cadres and the masses understand the situation at home and abroad and enable them to deepen understanding of the party 's and the state 's policies .  
At present , party committees and governments at various levels in the central and western regions have come to fully realize their resources advantages for the development of tourism in their areas , and are unifying thinking and making greater determination to take the development of tourism as a major leading industry in the great development of China 's west by doing intensive and down-to-earth work .  
It is necessary to proceed on the basis of resolving currently prominent problems and to have in mind long-term development ; it is necessary to vigorously proceed with the strategic adjustment of the economic structure , to further stabilize and enhance agriculture 's position as the base , to intensify the adjustment of the industrial structure , and to accelerate the grand development of the western region , so as to improve the overall quality of the national economy and to raise the economy to a higher level .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
The land area of the western region accounts for more than half of China 's total , with the arable land accounting for 27.7 percent and grassland three-fifths of the country 's total .  The annual average amount of water resources accounts for 46.6 percent of China 's total .  Together with the abundant sunlight resources , the western region has become China 's major cotton , flue-cured tobacco , fruits , flowers producing bases .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
The western region should energetically develop a pillar industry and competitive products , strive to develop new products , and form an agricultural product processing system focusing on the production of grain and cereal oil products , meat products , fruit and vegetable products , and traditional Chinese medicinal herb products with local distinguishing features and national characteristics .  
It is necessary to make use of the existing funding channels , adjust the orientation of the input of funds and the thinking of building bases , strengthen dynamics in supporting agricultural construction projects in the western region , and focus attention on grasping the building of commodity grain , cotton and sugar-bearing crop production bases as well as dry-land crop and water-saving farming demonstration counties and pastoral area comprehensive development demonstration projects in the western region .  
Chen Yaobang said : Through the efforts of several generations , the western region 's agriculture and rural economy will surely develop in a sustained and steady manner and the goal of building the western region into an agricultural producing region with the characteristics of red flowers , green grass and fragrant melons and fruits will surely be realized .  
Tian Fengshan said : The Ministry of Land and Natural Resources has initially formulated an " outline for development and utilization of land and natural resources in the western region " to ensure that the tapping of minerals and use of underground water will be handled in coordination with the work of ecological protection and returning grain plots to other uses in an orderly manner .  
Tian Fengshan finally told this reporter : In the foreseeable future , the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources will strengthen work in four fields to cope with the needs of large-scale development of the western region : First , we will strengthen the investigation and evaluation of the situation of land and natural resources in China 's western region so as to provide information for economic construction in the western region , especially the rational planning of infrastructure facilities , and to support the harnessing of major rivers , protection of ecological environment and prevention of disasters . 
Zeng Peiyan held : During the third session of the ninth National Committee of the CPPCC this year , CPPCC members posed some opinions and suggestions on the issue of the grand western development , which we highly valued .  We have categorized them and sent them to departments concerned for the research purpose .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
The people in the western region began to examine their past , and quite a few western provinces and autonomous regions have changed their old practice of standing still and refusing to make progress .  They have set up project banks to solicit businesses , established a " single-stop " service structure , and provided fine environment to attract domestic and foreign investors , so as to greet the upsurge of the grand western development in a brand new , open attitude .  
In the early period of new China , given that so many neglected tasks had to be undertaken while we were closely blockaded and encircled by western imperialism , it would have been unimaginable that we could have rapidly healed the wounds of the long period of war and enabled the national economy and various construction work to speedily develop if we had not concentrated finance , material , and manpower to engage in some large undertakings .  
Since the western countries instituted capitalist market economy , pollution , unemployment , and polarization between rich and poor have occurred all the time ; hence their governments have no alternative but to undertake the functions of improving efficiency , regulating income distribution , and stimulating macroeconomic stability and growth .  
Promoting coordinated regional economic development and instituting the strategy of major development of the western regions through standard switching of fiscal expenditure is extremely essential for maintaining and developing the excellent situation of stability and unity in the border ethnic regions , providing more extensive resources and markets for the entire national economy , and ultimately making all the people rich .  
He expressed hope that the two provinces could seize the present opportunity featured by the decision of the central authorities to implement a develop-the-west strategy and to accelerate the development of the country 's central and western regions ; work hard to transform their advantages in resources and in their geographic locations as a link between the country 's eastern and western regions into economic advantages in real terms ; and bring about a sustained , rapid , and healthy growth to each 's economy .  
Chen Jinhua added that the extensive development of the western region is of great significance for expanding domestic demand , boosting sustained national economic growth , promoting the coordinated development of various regional economies , and strengthening national unity .  
following the dramatic changes in the Soviet Union and east Europe , the international communist movement was at a low ebb , and hostile western forces seized the opportunity to carry out their strategic conspiracy to " westernize " and " split up " China , doing everything possible to peddle their political views , ideology , and way of life .  
Jiang Zemin said : China and Turkey are located respectively at the eastern and western ends of the Asian continent , and Turkey links the Asian and European continents .  It is of great significance that our two countries establish and develop on the basis of friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation a new relationship of cooperation and partnership characterized by mutual respect , mutual trust , equality and mutual benefit , long-term stability , and common development .  
and apply regular ideological education and strict management and supervision to foster a good work style among them .  In connection with implementing the strategy of the major development of west China , we should guide young cadres to actively join the ranks of developing the west ; we should select young cadres from the central and state organs and from regions where the economically is relatively developed , and send them to the western regions in a planned manner .  
After establishing " energy and transportation as key strategic points , " the late ' 80s and early ' 90s saw the inception of huge projects such as the Three Gorges Dam , the comprehensive hydro-power development of the middle and upper reaches of the Huang He River , accelerating development of western oil and central coal fields , and the extension of the Yanlonghai railway line as the " second continental bridge , " among other large-scale projects that concentrated funding in the west .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
The large-scale development of the western region as a major strategic task of the party and the state is now placed in a salient position .  Xinjiang situated along the northwestern border of the country is an important part of large-scale development in the western region , which will have a bearing on the overall situation in economic development .  
The restriction on projects on which restriction must be imposed can also be appropriately relaxed so long as such projects are conducive to the development of the western region and do not affect local environmental protection or the overall situation of national economic construction .  
In China , due to the unbalanced economic development , the central and western areas , where Chinese Moslems live in compact communities , lag behind the eastern areas and are still afflicted with poverty .  
At the same time , in the roadway development for the western region , we must put intense emphasis on ecological and environmental protection and management , protecting cultivated lands , economizing on land use , and industriously integrating roadway development with the improvement of the surrounding environment .  We do this in order to improve the ecology and environment of the west , and to contribute to the enhancement of environmental quality .  
Some comrades have abandoned the Marxist viewpoint on classes and method of class analysis ; they can not see the background to " a world filled with love " or perceive that extremely sharp and complex struggles still exist in the ideological and political field ; and they can not see the conspiracy of hostile western forces to " westernize " and " disintegrate " China .  
With regard to their penetration channels and means , while vigorously intensifying ideological penetration through traditional means such as newspapers , television , and radio , hostile western forces are continually resorting to new methods , and these moreover are becoming more and more concealed and deceptive .  
What the hostile western forces want to preserve is the capitalist private ownership system and the political and economic systems , values , and way of life that the bourgeoisie highly esteem , and all this runs counter to the essence of the socialist system under communist party leadership .  
While persisting in reform and opening up and speeding up exchanges with foreign countries , we must maintain high political vigilance and clear political heads , have a clear understanding of the true features of hostile western forces , lay a firm foundation in ideals and beliefs , build a strong ideological defense line , and win the initiative in the ideological battle .  
We must clearly perceive the political conspiracy and sinister ambition of western hostile forces on the human rights issue , always remain politically sober and staunch , and shoulder our mission of protecting the nation 's security and unity .  
The third stretch is composed of bases on the archipelagoes around Hawaii and on the Midway Island , Alaska and the Aleutian Islands . These bases are the main command center of the Pacific theater and serve as relay stations for the support coming from the western coast of continental United States for the forward bases .  
Ever since the time when peace and development were defined as the main theme of our time , a series of major strategic changes have been made in the principles that guide the work of the party , the state , and the army , for example , the formulation of a long-term objective of " three-step development " for the country 's modernization building ; the comprehensive establishment of coastal economic zones ; an all-positioned opening up in the country 's eastern , western , southern , , northern , and central regions ;  
At a time when we are deepening the rule of law and vigorously advancing the building of a socialist market economy , the party Central Committee has put forward the magnificent strategic goal of developing the western region on a large scale .  The establishment of this strategic goal has epoch-making significance to economic prosperity and development in China 's western region .  
how are we going to reform the old international political and economic order that is dominated by a small number of developed western countries and to build a new international political and economic order which is fair and reasonable ;  
People present at a meeting also indicated : No doubt the recent " canonization " is a bad thing , yet it also serves to sound the alarm for us .  It has helped to sober us ; and has enabled us to see more clearly the true features of the Vatican which interferes in China 's internal affairs by using a religious issue , and see more clearly the political plot of western hostile forces to stage an infiltration against China on the pretext of religion .  
Zhou Yongkang said : The " 2000 Western Forum of China " is held under the new circumstances following the adoption after deliberation by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee of the proposal for drawing up the " 10th Five-Year Plan " for national economic and social development ; it is a high-level , large-scale , and highly authoritative international conference with extensive influence as well as the western region 's brand-new form of opening to the outside world under the new circumstances .  
Li Zibin answered : The party Central Committee and the State Council have received a positive response from the people in the western region since they proposed implementing the strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  The vast masses of cadres and people in the western region are determined to seize this opportunity to bring about a leap in economic and social development .  
At present , the people throughout the province have a strong desire and high enthusiasm for making progress and speeding up economic and social development .  We ardently hope to seize the historic opportunity brought about by the state 's strategic decision on making the great development of the western areas to effective fast economic development .  
Let us jointly hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , under the leadership of the autonomous regional party committee and government and by making good use of the vigorous momentum of large-scale western development , forge ahead courageously and create more dazzling new splendors of economic and social development .  
In conclusion , Yang Chuantang said : The people of various nationalities in Tibet are confident in seizing the historic opportunity brought along by the large-scale development of the western region to speed up development , to narrow the gap between Tibet and fraternal provinces and municipalities , and to fulfill the grand objective of entering the front ranks of China 's drive for socialist modernization , an objective set by Comrade Deng Xiaoping .  
The United States also believes that , looking at the balance of forces in the Asia-Pacific region , the western forces headed by itself are overwhelmingly superior , and so the present moment is an excellent opportunity for establishing a constraining multilateral security mechanism under its own control , capable of resolving substantive problems .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
6 .  All central and western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities are permitted to select a development zone that has already been established in the provincial capital or autonomous regional capital to operate as a national-level economic and technological development zone .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
This tragic incident has further exposed the antihuman , antisocial , and antiscientific essence of the " Falungong " cult and pierced through the sham features of Li Hongzhi and western anti-China forces in preaching that permitting the practice of " Falungong " means " upholding human rights " .  
The western anti-China forces have discovered the points in common they have with Li Hongzhi and taken a favorable view of the use value of " Falungong , " and have thus not hesitated to reverse black and white and confuse right and wrong in gesticulating and making groundless accusations at the Chinese Government for banning the " Falungong " cult according to law .  
They say the current society and laws must first be destroyed before they can preach their teachings .  On several occasions , Li Hongzhi issued " personal instructions " to practitioners , ordered them to lay siege to government organs and newspaper offices , engaged in illegal gathering and anti-government activities , and served as a pawn for foreign anti-China forces in a vain attempt to play a role that the western anti-China forces have failed to do .  
In recent years , he has rounded up practitioners through this organizational system and has instigated his followers to carry out illegal activities , to willingly act as political tools for western anti-China forces , to try and execute impossible missions for these hostile foreign forces , and to severely interfere with proper social order .  In doing so , he has created a significant political backlash , and has fully exposed his vicious ulterior scheme to create social chaos .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
Faced with the extremely sharp and complicated international struggle , in the past 10-plus years , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core judged the hour and sized up the situation , took the initiative , maneuvered among various states , and defeated western hostile forces ' attempts to disturb us .  Under the leadership of the CPC , a socialist China , with a strong posture , is standing in the east of the world .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
maintain sharp vigilance against the attempts of " westernization " and " disintegration " made by western hostile forces , and against the infiltration and erosion of such erroneous ideological trends as " the non-party affiliation of the army " ; resolutely resist the corrosive influence and the attacks of decadent ideologies and cultures ; and firmly defend the authority of the party 's leading collective of the third generation with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
Chi Haotian said : Developing the western region and accelerating the development of the central and western regions is the major strategic policy of the party Central Committee and President Jiang Zemin after taking stock of the situation and making overall planning geared toward the new century .  It is of vital economic , political , social , and cultural significance .  
It is necessary to use the rich knowledge , human resources , and advantages of the scientific and technological strength of military institutions and scientific research institutes to further support science and technology and qualified personnel as well as strive to provide intellectual and personnel support for the great development of the western region .  
It is necessary to speed up the development of central and western China and , at the same time , continue to let eastern coastal areas play a leading role in promoting structural renovation , scientific and technological innovation , the process of opening up to the outside world , and economic growth .  This is an important part of and a strategic step toward the readjustment of the economic structure .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
The overall quality of the main bodies of our rural markets does not measure up to that in developed western countries .  Many peasants and farm enterprises not only do not understand international agricultural trade , but also have little knowledge about the domestic market situations involving agricultural products and agricultural key elements .  It will be hard for them to participate in a timely and effective way in vigorous international market competition after our entry in the WTO .  
In 2000 , the Ninth Five-Year for National Economic and Social Development was successfully completed , the development of the western region got off to a good start , and the economy developed in a healthy way .  During that year , China 's democratic and legal systems were continuously strengthened , and its human rights situation maintained a good momentum of development .  
Being the largest developing countries in the eastern and western hemispheres , China and Brazil have the duties to play a positive role in propelling the healthy development of the world political and economic situations .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
Over a long period in the past , our economic mode was not diversified , and practice showed that such an economic mode had no vigor and dynamism .  Now , to speed up development , the western areas must develop a mixed economic structure with the publicly owned economy as a main body and with the common development of economies in other ownership forms .  The masses should be mobilized to develop the economy so that the people can get rich when the country becomes powerful .  
Investment in the western areas increased obviously faster than that in the central and eastern parts of the country .  The high growth rate of investment was a result of the state 's policy to increase investment projects funded by national debt , and was also related to the fact that the base figure in the same period of last year was comparatively low and the construction periods this year moved ahead of schedule .  
The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .  
Most of the grass-roots units of this army unit are situated near the major center of the large-scale development of the western region , where the construction of some Sino-foreign joint venture projects have started with great momentum and to which tourists from afar , as well as Chinese and foreign reporters , are coming in a steady stream .  As a result , in the large-scale development of the western region , the unit has been subject to a grim test in terms of security work .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
It is hoped that implementing the great western development will gradually narrow the gap between the living standards in the east and the west and bring dramatic changes to the troops ' work and living environment as a result , and the masses of officers and men who have planted roots in the west to devote themselves to our national defense will become even more enthusiastic and energetic .  
The main contradiction plaguing the western regional garrisons ' logistical construction is the low standard of scientific and technological innovations and the key logistics elements ' low scientific and technological content .  There is a serious lack of qualified science and technology and well-educated personnel .  
The western region 's garrisons have formulated some concrete implementation measures , but society 's low overall scientific and technological standards have made it very difficult in practice for the troops to develop an awareness for science and technology , to coordinate science and technology to tackle the tough problems , and to introduce and propagate the successful results .  
To implement the great western development strategy , the state has explicitly arranged to let scientific and technological education take the lead .  It has mobilized the " Great Western Development Special Operation In Science and Technology , " and the localities are in the process of formulating , or have already formulated , their own developmental strategies to invigorate science and technology .  In the areas of opening up scientific research , circulation , competition , cooperation , and attraction and retention of talent , they have set up some effective working mechanisms .  
Looking ahead into the future , the western region 's scientific and technological standards no doubt will be raised to a much higher level , and the west 's scientific and technological vitality no doubt will propel the military 's work to invigorate logistics with science and technology to new heights .  
The western region 's economy is relatively backward , and even for the provincial cities , their economies and tertiary industry are still underdeveloped .  In particular , the troops that are stationed in the tough remote areas practically have no means to set up any kind of society-based safeguard .  
We must take advantage of the western great development to promote military economic construction and make scientific and technological innovation and the propagation of results the focal point as we resolutely embark on the road of using science and technology to invigorate rear services and find ways to raise the scientific and technological contents of logistical work .  
Matters that can be taken over by society should gradually be handed over to society ; security organs with nonmilitary functions should be handed over to the localities , and security organs that shoulder military functions should be streamlined and augmented to create a new logistical security system with operating mechanisms consistent with the Chinese military 's quality construction and the western region 's economic development .  
We must firmly uphold the concept of the whole situation and the concept of long-term construction to actively immerse ourselves in the western great development , work with a will to make the country strong and a spirit of arduous struggle to build an enterprise , and push forward the western region 's military economic construction step by step to make our due share of contribution to raising the country 's comprehensive national strength and increasing our national defense capability .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : In order to encourage enterprises at home and abroad to participate in developing and building China 's western region , the Chinese Government has adopted some preferential policies in the tax revenue sector : The income taxes of domestic and foreign-investment enterprises engaged in industries that are encouraged to develop in the western region by the state will be reduced at a rate of 15 percent within a certain period ;  
the import of technological equipment for private use by domestic-investment and foreign-investment industrial projects encouraged by the state , as well as superior industrial projects within their total amount of investments in the western region , will be exempted from paying tariffs and the import value-added tax , with an exception for commodities that are not allowed to enjoy tax exemption as stipulated by the state .  
Efforts should be made to seize the opportunity of the central authorities pursuing the large-scale western development strategy , put reconstruction work onto the local governments ' 10th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development and their programs for poverty eradication through development , promote development through the reconstruction efforts , and unceasingly facilitate common prosperity among all ethnic groups .  
Only by unifying the efforts of the party , the government , the army , the people , and the students as well as the efforts of various regions , including eastern , western , southern , northern , and central regions , will it be possible to build a strong and unified force for our " strike hard " struggle aimed at rectifying social order .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
An authoritative department reveals that in order to coordinate with the large-scale western development now in full swing in China , the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and other departments concerned will jointly select and assign excellent young cadres in stages and in groups from the Central Authorities , state organs , eastern region as well as important state-owned enterprises , universities and colleges of higher learning , and scientific research academies and institutes to go to the western region for tempering on suspended duties .  
The " outlines " puts forward a " three-step " strategy for Tibet 's economic and social development in the coming century , that is , Tibet 's per capita GDP will be in the front ranks of the western region by the year 2005 , will reach the intermediate level in the country by the year 2010 , and will join the front ranks of the country by the middle of this century .  
In coping with external military threats , Russia , which is resolutely opposed to NATO 's expansion to the east , has put forward a proposal for establishing , with European countries , a rapid reaction force to maintain the security of Europe . Moreover , Russia has held many large-scale military exercises with the Commonwealth of Independent States and established a " collective air-defense system " in the western part of Russia .  
First of all , Zhu Rongji expressed his appreciation for the attention given by Hong Kong 's industrial circles and professionals to the strategy of developing the western region and to the vigorous assistance and support given by the Hong Kong SAR in their participation in the strategy .  He hoped that Hong Kong 's industrial and commercial circles would play a greater role in developing the motherland 's western region and in promoting the common development of Hong Kong and the interior .  
To meet the requirements of the present new situation in the work of poverty relief through development and in consideration of the current distribution and the special characteristics of the poverty-stricken population in rural areas , the " Program " has placed the stress of state support on minority-inhabited areas , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and exceptionally impoverished areas in the country 's central and western regions .  
The work of having the 13 eastern provinces and municipalities give support to the development of the 10 western provinces and autonomous regions is an important measure to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of " two great prospects " to promote coordinated development of regional economy and reduce the economic gap between the east and the west regions .  
We will focus firmly on the central task of developing the western region on a large scale ; persistently follow the guidelines for work in Tibet in the new period ; and make the acceleration of development the main theme , the expansion of an economy characteristic of Tibet and economic restructuring the masterstrokes , the reform , opening up , and scientific and technological progress the motive force , and the improvement of the people 's living standards the basic point of departure .  
At that time , the entire country of China was in the midst of a crisis of being carved up , and the Qing government was forced to conclude and sign numerous unequal treaties ceding territory and paying indemnities because of its inability to withstand the gunboats and terrific cannon of the western Great Powers .  
All relevant troops , academies , and scientific research units have taken the initiative to contact the stationed areas , understand the technological items urgently needed in local construction , and organize all forces and spare no efforts to engage in research and development of the items .  As a result , some major technological difficulties encountered in implementing the key state , provincial , and city engineering projects in the western area have been resolved .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that the party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang Zemin pay great attention to the development of minority ethnic groups and areas inhabited by them and are concerned about improving the living standard of minority ethnic groups .  An important focus of attention and starting point in implementing the strategy of developing the western region is to help areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups develop faster .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
In the light of the needs of its social and economic development as well as the needs of its industrial structural readjustment , and also in accordance with its promises concerning the WTO accession , China is to accelerate the opening of its central and western regions , as well as its service trade , to the outside world ; and is to increasingly expand the scale of its foreign investment introduction , and to open more fields to foreign investment .  
By guiding foreign investment toward infrastructural construction , the exploration of mineral resources , the development of tourist resources , the ecological environmental protection , the agricultural and livestock products processing , the transformation of existing production capacities , and to such scientific and technological projects as the development and manufacturing of new-type electronic components in its western region , China will provide a host of investment and trade opportunities for foreign investors , said Deng Zhan .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The western provinces and regions have vast land , great market potential , rich resources , low labor costs , unique comparative advantages , and tremendous development potential .  
This is not only a good method of resolving the issue of a lack of funds , but will also bring in professional human resources , information , advanced technology and management expertise , and scientific marketing networks .  This will promote the enhancement of local products ' quality and the local enterprises ' competitive power in the international market , and will thus bring great benefits to the economic development in the western areas .  
We must closely seize upon the excellent opportunity for strategic implementation of great western expansion and a stable social situation in Tibet , aim for prosperity , progress and long-term stability in Tibet , focus our energy on solving major issues concerning the overall development and stability of Tibet , promote Tibet 's economy from one marked by accelerating progress to one marked by leaps and bounds development , and promote Tibet 's social situation from one of basic stability to one of long-term stability .  
and was an out and out dictator .  He blindly followed western parliamentary and democratic elections in disregard of specific conditions , which caused endless wrangles among parties and factions , continuous upheaval in the political situation , and serious economic losses .  
Our source disclosed that in 1993 , tapes on the execution of prisoners taken from court archives were sold to foreigners by two public security and court officials at the price of scores of ten-thousand yuan .  The tapes were " edited " and combined with documentary tapes on kidney transplants at hospitals and then handed over to the western media for repeated airing just before the International Olympic Committee was about to cast its vote .  The negative impact was so great that it cost China its bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games .  
Go a step further in optimizing foreign companies ' investment in the industrial structure , raise foreign companies ' investment in the content of science and technology , continually expand the scope of foreign companies ' investment , strive to complete the regional distribution of foreign companies ' investment , encourage foreign companies to invest in our central and western areas , improve the legal system concerning foreign investment , further transform the role of government , and carry forward administration according to law .  
Today , the center has timely adopted the wise strategy of the great development of the western regions , in order to advance the great development of the western regions where minority nationalities are concentrated .  We should make our contributions to the great development of the western regions , social development , and national unity .  
This method of attempting to wreck and even wipe out its will to resist by striking at the psychology of a country 's top leadership stratum should be described as psychological warfare at the strategic level , which is intended to eliminate at a small price potential obstacles that may arise to counter western countries such as the United States and Britain , and reach their aim of dominating the world at will .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
You have always maintained the true political qualities of being loyal to the party , to the country , to the people and to socialism .  You have resolutely waged struggles against western hostile forces and the national splittists , won great victories in suppressing rebels and bandits and in the self-defense counterattack , forcefully maintained border and social stability in Tibet , and defended our state sovereignty , territorial integrity and national unity .  
The negative impact of economic globalization has not only caused unhappiness in poor countries but has also aroused strong opposition among various social strata such as environmentalists and trade union organizations in the developed countries , with the result that demonstrations against international meetings dominated by the developed western countries have continually escalated in recent years .  
We should play a vanguard role in the building of a spiritual civilization , guide the masses of all ethnic groups to emancipate their minds and renew their concepts , advocate science , and provide a strong spiritual motive power for economic growth in border areas .  We should play the role of a commando in the country 's large-scale development of its western region , firmly establish the thinking that we must develop and bring wealth to border areas while defending and consolidating them ;  
actively organize and encourage both army troops and militia reserves to plunge themselves in the current large-scale development of the country 's western region ; take up urgent , difficult , dangerous , and heavy tasks on our own initiative ; and strive for dual effects of promoting economic development and consolidating the defense building in line with the principle of manufacturing products for both peacetime and wartime use and for both military and civilian use .  
He expressed hope that local comrades could firmly seize the present rare opportunity of the state 's large-scale development of the western region , make a full use of their advantageous geographic conditions , proceed their work from realistic conditions , forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , do their work in a down-to-earth manner , and strive to bring about a faster and better economic and social development .  
Aleksandr Nikolasov , deputy director of the National Economic Forecast and Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , stated : Over the past few years , the Russian Government and industrial circles have attached growing importance to exploiting energy resources in eastern Russia , and with large oil and gas fields discovered and verified in eastern and western Siberia and in Russia 's far east , and proven deposits outstripping future demand in those regions , Russia is bound to increase energy exports by a large margin . 
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .  
As early as in the eighties , Deng Xiaoping , the chief architect of China 's reform and opening up program , already put forth the concept of coordinating the nation 's economic development .  According to the concept , central and western China should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .  Then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western China speed up its development with even more resources in return .  
Because of two decades ' rapid and steady economic growth , China 's combined national strength has grown remarkably , enabling it to increase its support for central and western parts of China .  
Some localities have planned to increase investment , and others have begun returning land unfit for farming to forestry and animal husbandry , raising the curtain on ecological construction .  Braving the piercingly cold wind , quite a few cadres from the western region went to the eastern and southern parts of the country , busying themselves with the introduction of projects .  
At the time when the heat wave of developing West China gradually ran high , the recently established leading group for the development of the western region under the State Council held a meeting , at which it was pointed out that on the basis of thorough investigation and study , it is imperative to draw up a realistic and feasible overall plan and some special plans now , and include them into the Tenth Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development .  
The large-scale development of the western region has a bearing on the overall situation of developing coordinated regional economy , promoting national unity , and maintaining social stability .  That is why it will never do without a scientific plan .  
The central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .  
It is gratifying that , in the western region now , the masses ' enthusiasm for opening up cultivated land on slopes and returning land unfit for grain production to forestry and animal husbandry is running high .  This valuable enthusiasm of the peasants must be seriously protected through such measures as reducing peasants ' burdens , and others .  
We believe that with the wise leadership of the party 's central committee and the valuable experiences gained in reform , opening up , and economic construction , the scientific planning work for the western development will certainly yield good results , and the magnificent ideal of the large-scale development of West China will certainly become a reality .  
A concerned expert in Beijing today revealed that with the implementation of a great strategy for developing the western region , the state will promote policies in favor of the western region in four fields : The state will appropriate 60 percent of obtainable foreign funds to the western region , permit cities in the western region to issue lottery tickets for the construction of infrastructure facilities , expand the scale of issuance of bonds by local enterprises , and try to establish an industrial investment fund in the western region .  
The concerned expert notes that since the founding of the State Development Bank five years ago , it has implemented the state 's macro-economic policy , industrial policy and regional development policy .  The bank has supported the development in central and western regions and the amount of loans extended to central and western regions accounted for more than 60 percent of its total loans each year .  
At present , the State Development Bank has extended loans to central and western regions with a total of nearly 400 billion yuan .  In Gansu , Qinghai and Ningxia , the bank has successively supported state and local key construction projects such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Gas Field , the Lan-Xin Railway , the Daxia Hydroelectric Power State , the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metal Mine , the Ningxia Power Plant , the Qinghai Oil Field and the Lijiaxia Hydroelectric Power Station .  
According to the plan of the China Power Company , in the next 15 years , China will lay stress on developing hydropower plants in the western region .  The goal is to realize " sending electric power from the west to the east " and establish a national joint power supply network .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
The total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in China 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .  
Based on China 's own interests , joining G-8 will give China more opportunities to express its views and exert influence on important economic , political and diplomatic affairs and other global issues and will have an additional place to deal with international affairs and a mechanism to coordinate foreign affairs and maneuver among major western countries .  
According to initial revelations , continuing to increase domestic demand , carrying out structural adjustments , pressing ahead with the great development of the western region , deepening reform of state-owned enterprises , stepping up efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and improving the social welfare and insurance systems , will be the vital parts of the report .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
The practice of the omnidirectional opening up has turned the western region to be a forward position and has enabled China to maintain considerably closer economic contacts with the contiguous countries in the north , west , and southwest .  
First , we have been engaged in reform and opening up for more than 20 years , so that the country has considerably increased its economic strength , and the eastern region , in particular , has laid a relatively solid foundation for economic development and is capable of making further advance by mainly depending on its own efforts , thus enabling the country to shift the focus of development to the western region .  
Fourth , after years of development , the western region has initially possessed the soft environment for attracting foreign investment , and more and more overseas enterprises , having realized the enormous potential for the western development , have come one after another to make investment in the western region .  
This is because the natural conditions in some areas are abominable , the distance between cities in the region is very long , and that between the western cities and the eastern developed areas is even longer , and the infrastructure , economic foundation , and social and human conditions are relatively weak .  The development of the western region needs a huge amount of input , but the return rate of some input items is low in the short time .  
Fourth , various localities in the western region should work out their concrete plans according to the local conditions under the overall plan of the central authorities on the grand western development .  In drafting the concrete plans , attention should be paid to abiding by the market economic rules , giving free rein to the markets , and making the best use of their advantages while bypassing their disadvantages .  
Although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .  
In the future , the eastern region should more positively explore the modes of cooperation for mutual benefits in light of the market economic rules by way of , for example , going to make investment in the western region for the exploitation of natural resources , participating in some companies there through shareholding , transferring some commodities to the western region in which there are greater benefits in producing such commodities , and so forth . 
Invited member Zhao Jiazhi , who rushed here from the old industrial base of Jilin Province , indicated that , in attending the session this time , he aimed most at gaining understanding of major arrangements made by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council that are oriented toward the new century , especially arrangements on how to develop the western region and coastal regions .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
The central authorities adopted the policy decision of accelerating the development of the vast western region last year .  This is a strategic shift in China 's economic construction .  For a large country like China , it is undoubtedly not enough to have only a developed and prosperous eastern coastal region .  
On developing China 's western regions , Li Peng pointed out : Implementing the strategy for accelerating economic development in the western and central regions is a major policy decision of the CPC Central Committee , a decision oriented to the new century and having the whole situation taken into consideration .  It has an important bearing on balanced development of China 's eastern and western regions and the eventual realization of the nation 's common prosperity .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Laying stress on the metallurgical , textile , petrochemical , nonferrous metals , mechanical , telecommunication , and paper industries , we selectively supported sound and strong enterprises and favored old industrial bases in northeast China as well as the central and western regions and made arrangements for the technological transformation of a number of symbolic projects .  
The Chinese Government 's strategy of a large-scale west development is a long-term system project which has a vital importance to the country 's overall situation ; therefore , its development pattern will differ from that of a traditional regional development .  What is more , instead of being just a simple exploration of natural resources , the large-scale development of the western region aims to bring about a comprehensive and well-coordinated economic and social development to the western region through a series of capital , technological , and manpower inputs .  
With a view to enhancing the economic returns of their agricultural products , all provinces and autonomous regions in the western region should base themselves on each 's local geographic , climatic , and resource conditions ; and develop a specialty agriculture in the light of each 's local conditions , including an ecological agriculture , water-economizing agriculture , and an agriculture of " two highs and one superior . "  At the same time , they should also rely on scientific and technological progresses , and heighten the scientific and technological contents of agriculture .  
We Yi noted : The state has already extended a number of preferential policies to the western region to encourage the region to introduce foreign investment , and the western region should therefore acquire an adequate understanding and make a good use of these policies .  Meanwhile , it should also draw on the experiences of the country 's eastern coastal areas in introducing foreign investment .  
But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .  China has formed a mechanism for socialist market economy .  Our current efforts to develop the country 's vast western region means a great development project under the condition of new science and technology .  
Therefore , the development of the country 's vast western region should be in line with the rule of the market economy , focus on the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and fully utilize the results of scientific and technological progress .  We should carry out a leap-frog-type development project , with a starting point higher than the one we had 20 years ago .  
Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .  Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .  However , the most fundamental thing is that we must rely on ourselves .  Years ago , the development in the eastern region did in a wrong way including redundant construction projects , environmental pollution and the bubble economy .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
The strategy for large-scale development of western China , which President Jiang Zemin put forth early last year , and the national economic conference held late last year and the State Council conference held last January on developing the west all show that large-scale development of western China had become a common understanding of central and local leading hierarchies across the country .

But we also have to realize that over the past 20 years , the world has witnessed great changes in economic and scientific domains and China also has undergone great changes in economic and social aspects .  China has formed a mechanism for socialist market economy .  Our current efforts to develop the country 's vast western region means a great development project under the condition of new science and technology .  
Therefore , the development of the country 's vast western region should be in line with the rule of the market economy , focus on the enhancement of the quality and efficiency of economic growth , and fully utilize the results of scientific and technological progress .  We should carry out a leap-frog-type development project , with a starting point higher than the one we had 20 years ago .  
Wen Jiabao said : The key to successfully develop the country 's vast western region lies in the adjustment of industrial structure .  For this purpose , we should strengthen the role of agriculture as the foundation of the national economy .  Particularly , we should not overlook the current conditions of a large population and limited farmland as well as an increasing population and decreasing farmland .  
Wang Lequan noted that the central authorities have made large investments in the large-scale development of the western region and adopted many preferential policies .  However , the most fundamental thing is that we must rely on ourselves .  Years ago , the development in the eastern region did in a wrong way including redundant construction projects , environmental pollution and the bubble economy .  
Tian pointed out : The western regions are rich in natural resources but have a rather fragile ecological environment .  In particular , they are short of river resources and have suffered from serious soil erosion .  Thus the scientific and technological units and scientific and education personnel should directly participate in the work of harnessing soil erosion and building the ecological environment .  
With a high sense of responsibility to the state and nation , the deputies and members carried out profound studies and discussions focused on the major topics of development of the western regions , strategic readjustment of the economic structure , state enterprise reform , boosting the nation with science and technology , strict administration , social stagnation , and promoting reunification of the motherland .  They also put forward a number of constructive opinions and motions .  
The implementation of the large-scale western development is China 's major policy decision oriented to the new century , which , like the eastern coastal region that previously took the lead in development and contributed to the sustained and rapid economic development in the entire country , will certainly provide enormous market and development prospects for the eastern and central regions and energetically promote greater economic prosperity throughout the country .  
According to their analysis , foreign trade and economic cooperation experts here maintained : The improved external environment , stable domestic economic growth , accelerated pace of China 's entry into the WTO , and the launch of China 's strategy of developing its western region in a big way have helped both strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in investing in China and provide them with opportunities and possibilities to expand their investment in China .  
At present , the work of formulating laws and regulations should be focused on the issues of promoting the structural adjustment and industrialization in agriculture ; standardizing the rural market , the rural cooperatives , and the joint-stock cooperative system in rural areas ; protecting peasants ' legitimate rights and interests ; supporting and protecting agricultural development ; supporting the development of the western region ; protecting agricultural resources and the ecological environment , and promoting social development in rural areas .  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
Outside construction firms are not allowed to enter local markets ; layers of restriction block the inflow and outflow of personnel ; tedious approval procedures and unreasonable fees : this is how local policies and regulations in western China have built up " sealed walls . "  Since the implementation of development in the west , these walls are now being " torn down . "  
Li Tieying stressed : The development of the western regions is a massive and systematic project involving ecological environmental protection , infrastructure construction , industrial restructuring , scientific and technological education , reform and opening up , and ethnic and religious issues .  
Therefore , the task of narrowing the development gap between the western and eastern regions to bring about regional economic and social revitalization and prosperity can not be accomplished with just one or two five-year plans or a 10-year program .  The task can only be eventually achieved through long-term and ceaseless efforts of many generations .  
Li Tieying pointed out : The western regions have rich hydropower , mineral , and biological resources and numerous sites of human civilization and natural scenery .  Many industries have established a good foundation in the regions .  
For a long time , the [ gap between ] economic and social development in eastern and western China has been growing larger , and this is primarily because of differences in scientific and technical levels and capabilities .  The government has already formulated the strategy for the major development of western China , and through the training , development , and effective utilization of S &amp; T human resources , we will improve our economic qualities and industrial competitiveness , bringing about the leapfrog development of the social productive forces in western China .  
In particular , when its features of opposing the KMT 's autocratic and despotic rule and opposing the CPC 's and communism 's deprivation of democracy and human rights emerge , lured by the fragrant " western meal " of " democracy and human rights , " the program is powerfully bewitching and deceptive , and thus gained support and adherents .  
The anti-China activities of " Taiwan independence thinkers " were coordinated with those of western anti-China political forces and human rights organizations , with east and west singing in tune ; they groundlessly labelled the mainland of the motherland as " opposed to democracy and human rights " ; for instance they frequently applied their self-flaunted " democracy and human rights " to abuse the CPC 's opposition to " Taiwan independence " as oppressing Taiwan with " nationalism " and " great Han chauvinism . "  
Of equal importance is the fact that we must use practical and effective measures to deal with the Taiwan authorities in international " human rights above sovereignty " activities .  In particular , regarding the activities they carry out in western countries , we must have a plan for response , we must take initiative , and we must have a definite scope and counterpoint .  
In order to meet with the challenges , it is imperative for the Chinese government to make some adjustments to its economic policies , vigorously develop modern agriculture , and quicken the tempo of agricultural modernization , upgrading of industrial structure , construction of infrastructure facilities , protection of ecological environment , and development of the central and western regions .  
We should deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises ; vigorously develop rural and urban collectives , individual ownership , private ownership , and divers types of other economic ownership ; and groom enterprises into the principal bodies in the development of the western region .  
During his inspection , Li Tieying also listened to reports on Chongqing 's ideas and work on participating in the extensive development of the western region .  In addition , he inspected private enterprises and demonstration areas for national spiritual civilization building , as well as demonstration streets for the national activities against counterfeit goods , the civilization community , and experimental primary schools .  
Li Peng , member of the Standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee , stressed at the forum : In developing the western regions , we must properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; ensure a benign cycle for resources exploitation and ecological protection ; and leave our future generations with space for sustainable development .  
We should develop the western regions on a large scale and with firm efforts by proceeding in a planned and orderly way and advancing step by step ; should properly handle relations between economic development and environmental protection ; and should never sabotage ecological environment in this process .  
The remarks of Xin Qi , a Chinese expert on the Taiwan issue , made at a discussion held recently by the Society for the Chinese in western America were reported by a newspaper under an eye-catching title of " Surely attack if independence , and surely win if attacking - - no fear of launching a nuclear war to fight a decisive battle . "  The newspaper also claimed that by voicing the " appalling words , " he will " definitely reinforce his image of commonly deemed the spokesman for the People 's Liberation Army . "  
Chongqing is an important city on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang and is rich in scientific and technological strength and educational resources .  It should deepen education reform , comprehensively promote quality education , and train large numbers of capable personnel in various fields to meet the needs of the development of the western region .  
Li Lanqing said that in developing the western region , we must seriously implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's idea that " science and technology are the primary productive force , " and accelerate the pace of the reform of the science and technology management structure according to the needs of speeding up the industrialization of science and technology achievements in order to tap the tremendous scientific and technological potential of the western region and give full play to the advantage of science and technology .  
Actively seek to create the conditions for improvement of the ecological environment of the western area , for improvement of plant and animal products , and for restructuring the agricultural industry .  Introduce superior foreign breeding stock , poultry chicks , seeds , seedlings , and such , into the western area , and give priority technical support to the entry and quarantine inspection of them .  
It is reported that the state has taken the development of forestry in the western region as another strategic priority to the forestry construction .  The State Forest Bureau plans to invest 100 billion yuan in the next 10 years to develop afforestation along the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and the upper and middle reaches of Huang He . Meanwhile , effective measures will be taken to plant trees in closed hillsides and to return cultivated areas into forests in an effort to bring desertification under control .  
While continuing to give play to the advantage of the eastern region , the strategy of the development of the western region will be implemented , the development of the central and western regions will be quickened , and mutual promotion and coordinate development between the eastern , central and western regions will be enhanced with sustained economic growth .  
By the time these cities see an economic takeoff , it is appropriate that the factories in Hong Kong implement its active investment plans , and move their factories which are originally concentrated in southern China to the areas along the Chang Jiang or in the western regions where wages and land prices are comparatively lower , so as to occupy the commanding height .  China is gradually accelerating its efforts of opening up to the outside world .  Hong Kong is a special administrative region under the " one country , two systems . "  
Li Ruihuan said : The large-scale development of the western region is a strategic decision made by the CPC Central Committee according to Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's concept of " two general situations , " which will be of the utmost importance for the development of both the western and eastern regions and even for sustainable economic and social development throughout the country and for achieving the third-step strategic objective of the modernization drive and common prosperity for all people .  
He said : There were both subjective and objective reasons for the backwardness of the western region , and it also involved problems in policy , work , and natural conditions ; furthermore , conditions in various parts of the western region vary , and new problems will arise after stepping up the effort at development .  The large-scale development of the western region is a massive , complicated project , which calls for long-term , arduous efforts by people in various circles .  
We must persist in getting some things done and leaving others undone , do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the key points , and concentrate finance and materials on resolving a number of major problems with a bearing on the overall situation of western development , so as to lead forward overall western development .  
Under the present new international and domestic situations , further doing a good job of cultivating and selecting minority cadres is of still greater importance to implementing the guidelines of the 15th national party congress and the central nationality work meeting , putting into effect Comrade Jiang Zemin 's demands on " three represents , " smashing the Western hostile forces ' political conspiracy of " Westernizing " and " dividing " China , accelerating the implementation of the large-scale western development , and achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
During her recent inspection tour of Guizhou , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , emphasized the necessity of seriously studying a series of important instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on developing the western region , firmly seizing the historical opportunity for developing the western region , further emancipating the mind , changing concepts , boldly using foreign and domestic funds , opening up wider , and promoting development .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .  
She pointed out that while opening up wider to the outside world , the western region should pay attention to opening up to other parts of the country , establishing various kinds and forms of economic cooperation with the developed areas in the interior , supplementing each other 's advantages , making great efforts to develop high-tech enterprises , and jointly developing domestic and foreign markets to attain common development .  
Since early June , the larger part north of the Huang He has experienced a hot weather with hardly any rain .  During this period , high temperatures lasted for several consecutive days in northwest China , north China , northeast China , as well as the Huang He and Huai He regions , worsening the drought that began to break out in north and northwest China in the spring of this year and causing the drought in the western part of northeast China to drastically deteriorate .  
In the next 10 years , it plans to increase the annual extraction volume to 120 billion cubic meters of which 100 billion cubic meters can be set aside for export .  So , with its natural gas reserves , it is capable of providing China with a sufficient natural gas supply which not only can guarantee the smooth implementation of China 's project " to transmit natural gas from the western part of the country to the east " but also can enhance the efficiency of the future natural gas pipeline cooperation .  
In the coming 10 years , Turkmenistan has planned to increase its annual output to 120 billion cubic meters , of which 100 billion cubic meters can be exported .  Turkmenistan has sufficient natural gas reserves to provide China with natural gas .  This not only guarantees the smooth implementation of the project to " send natural gas from the western region to the east , " but also can improve the efficiency in cooperation to lay pipelines in future .  
the people wanted change and wanted progress , and their undertakings were thriving .  She applauded the western great development strategy and the series of policy measures formulated and implemented by the provincial party committee and provincial government , saying they were very much suited to Sichuan and had huge growth potential .  
In deploying this strategic plan , the western region must clearly understand and grasp the international and domestic economic situations , take the changing situations into consideration , adopt the appropriate measures to push their economic work forward , and use expanded opening up to give impetus to development .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
While inspecting the Urumqi-Kuitun Freeway , Ismail Amat pointed out : By standing high , seeing far , and facing up to a new century , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council has made such a wise decision as to implement a strategy of developing the western regions on a large scale , this being also a strategic arrangement made by the central authorities for speeding up the development of the regions inhabited by ethnic minorities .  
lay stress on key issues in their work ; rely on their own strength ; and carry out , in a down-to-earth manner , all the principles and policies that the central authorities have formulated for a sound implementation of the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region in connection with both the state enterprise reform and the work of economic structural readjustment .  
Wu Bangguo pointed out : The implementation of the strategy for the large-scale development of the western region is of great importance to bringing about a well-coordinated development to the country 's central and western areas ; to strengthening national unity , maintaining social stability , and consolidating border defense ; and also to promoting a sustained , rapid , and healthy [ chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan ] national economic growth .  
Besides , it has also given expression to the essential demand of socialism for an ultimate realization of common prosperity .  Thanks to its abundant natural resources , its sound economic foundation , and its strong scientific and technological strength , Sichuan occupies an extremely important position in the development of the western region .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .  Meanwhile , we have worked out a host of preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the central and western regions , with a view to restructuring the industries and regions that use foreign capital .  
In the face of such a new situation , ever since last year , the DPRK has been taking active steps to readjust its foreign policies .  It has engaged itself in multilateral diplomatic activities ; and has made positive headway in such aspects as improving the North-South relations on the Korean Peninsula , strengthening its relations with neighboring countries , and seeking to promote its ties with both western countries and countries in other parts of the world .  
Qian Qichen pointed out that protecting and improving the ecological environment and improving the environmental quality is an important task that must be accomplished in developing the western region .  
Qian Qichen emphasized that in developing tourism in the western region , it is imperative to create respective characteristics .  It is necessary to develop a number of high-quality tourist routes characteristic of the western region and create a number of tourist scenic zones with national brand names through developing advantageous tourist resources , such as natural landscape , plateau ventures , and ethic customs .  
Shi Guangsheng finally expressed his hope that the China-Japan investment promotion organization will encourage Japanese enterprises to make more investment in China 's central and western regions , conduct research and development activities in China , set up more advanced technological enterprises , intensify the cooperation among medium and small enterprises , and participate in the reorganization and transformation of China 's state-owned enterprises , thus enabling the Sino-Japanese investment cooperation undertaking to scale a new height .  
The Japanese personalities attending the meeting universally expressed their admiration for the macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government and the national economy that has maintained a sustained and rapid growth .  They also showed intense interest in the new situation that China will soon accede to the WTO and implement its strategy of developing the western region on a large scale .  
He said : Because China will soon join the WTO , is carrying out the strategy of large-scale development of western regions , and , in particular , has registered sustained and steady economic development , Japanese industrial and commercial circles have shown unprecedented enthusiasm for investment in China .  
According to actual conditions , we should investigate and handle cases of abusing power for private gains and claiming and accepting bribes , which may arise in the course of developing the western region ; cases of embezzling , misappropriating , and holding back special construction funds for large-scale development of the western region , major economic losses and accidents due to neglect of duties , cases of transferring state assets , and serious losses of state assets .  
Both economic development and the improvement in the ecological environment should depend on progress in science and technology .  Only through using new science and technology achievements to transform the traditional industries , developing high-tech industries , and continuously enabling technology to develop by leaps and bounds will it be possible to gradually narrow the gap between the western region and the developed region .  
The constant improvement in the quality of science , technology and culture of cadres at all levels and the people of all ethnic groups , and the constant increase in the sense of democracy and the legal system and the expansion of the spiritual civilization will create a favorable investment and development environment for developing the western region .  The improvement in such environment itself is a kind of important fundamental construction , which is just as important as the construction of infrastructure and other hardware .  
strive to form a coordinated and complete system of various branches of learning that is closely integrated with local economic and social development ; improve the quality and benefits of running schools ; pay attention to studying and solving major problems in science and technology that have to be immediately solved in developing the local economy while training more capable personnel for the development of the western region ;  
The funds raised through the issuance of this additional government debt would basically be used to accelerate progress in national construction projects funded with national debt .  This includes making up for the inadequate local complementary funds for national debt funded projects in central and western areas of China .  
Both foreign ministers also exchanged opinions on increasing bilateral cooperation in the fields of information technology industry , environmental protection , developing China 's western region , and cracking down on transnational organizational crimes .  They reached consensus of opinion extensively .  
It was learned that new students admitted by the Central Party School this autumn will study at the advanced study class for provincial and ministerial level cadres , advanced study class for prefectural and department level cadres , advanced study class for secretaries of country and city party committees , training class for minority cadres from Xinjiang and Tibet , cadres training class for the western region , and post graduate study class for doctor 's and master 's degrees .  
The existing industrial foundations , technological capabilities , rich natural resources , and superiority in labor resources in the central and western regions will provide favorable conditions for foreign businesses to participate in the cooperative development of China 's central and western regions .  
While making positive contributions to economic development and social progress in countries in which they settle , overseas compatriots have supported China with great enthusiasm in many aspects : With their advantages in capital , technology , and talent , they have actively participated in the great practice of China 's reform and opening up and in the implementation of the strategy for the extensive development of the western region .  They have played a leading role and served as a bridge in China 's exchanges with foreign countries .  
During the first half of the year , State Council counsellors focused on the central work of the Party and the government , responding enthusiastically to the call from the CPC Central Committee for the " large-scale development of western China . " Eight separate groups made arduous journeys to the midwestern region - - particularly to frontier areas and poor areas - - to conduct survey studies , writing a number of high-quality research reports and making excellent suggestions , which won the high regard and full affirmation of leading comrades in the State Council .  
A vehicle carrying explosives set to be destroyed suddenly exploded around 1938 hours on 8 September when traveling on Xishan Road in the western suburbs of Urumqi , killing 60 people , injuring 173 others , and damaging more than 20 motor vehicles and houses nearby .  
The pipeline will be more than 4,000 km long , running through nine provinces and autonomous regions in the western , central and eastern regions .  The total investment for its first-stage construction , including the building of some down-stream auxiliary projects , will be 120 billion yuan .  
In order to enable the people 's congresses to further play their leading role in the building of legal system and provide perfect legal protection and better service to the large-scale western development , the " Seminar on Large-scale Western Development and Legal System Building " was held in Chongqing this morning , which was attended by the personalities in charge of the standing committees of the people 's congresses from various provinces , autonomous regions , and municipality in western China .  
Thus , doing a good job of the building of legal system for the western region and using the legal system to lead , standardize , promote , and ensure the large-scale western development is the internal requirement of the socialist market economic development , the concrete practice of the general principle of administering the country in accordance with the law , and the inevitable choice that conforms to the trend of economic globalization as well .  
In this respect , it is necessary to release the enthusiasm of both the central and local authorities .  With regard to the laws and regulations , some of them require the unified legislation by the state , and others need to be considered by various western provinces , autonomous regions , and municipality according to the state 's laws , the administrative laws and regulations , and the central policies in light of the local realities .  
Under the leadership of the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory , we should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , be bold in practice and courageous in exploration , correctly understand and take advantage of the special characteristics and law governing the building of legal system for the large-scale western development , do a good job of this building in a conscientious and effective way , and make appropriate contributions to the large-scale western development with our own highly fruitful work .  
We should adapt ourselves to the new situation of developing socialist market economy and to the development of international and domestic markets under the new conditions of deepening reform and opening up wider , consider the reality of the western region , strive to explore new concepts , new mechanisms and new methods , base ourselves on the present , aim at the future , do what we are capable of step by step , and ensure an orderly , rapid and highly efficient proceeding of the large-scale development of the western region .  
First of all , we should do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the priority tasks , concentrate our financial and material resources on solving major problems that concern the overall development of the western region , and promote a comprehensive economic and social development .  
In deciding on relevant projects , it is necessary to give overall consideration to economic benefit , social benefit and ecological benefit so as to bring about a coordinated development of natural resources , ecology , economy , population and society in the western region .  
To Effectively control the population scale is conducive to relaxing the pressure of the population on the weak ecological environment and the economic and social development , to improving the population quality and structure , and to increasing manpower and capital of the western region .  It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and the sense of urgency of correctly handling the relationship between development and population control .  
On the one hand , the state will continue to pursue an expansive fiscal policy and issue additional treasury bonds ; the technical-transformation projects supported by the state will be carried out step by step .  In addition , investment in the western region will increase , enterprises will recover their confidence in investment , and an internal driving force for promoting the growth of investment will be gradually strengthened .  
In order to meet the requirements of China 's development of the western region , Wan Xueyuan , director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs , said here today that China 's hiring of foreign experts in the coming year will be focused on the development strategy of the western region .  We will draw the experience of foreign countries in regional development and implement the project of guiding intellectual resources to the western region .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , Wan Xueyuan said , we should enormously attract qualified personnel from the eastern region to participate in the economic construction and development of the western region , and also attract people from other countries , including Chinese students studying abroad and foreign experts .  
While guiding intellectual resources to the western region , the Chinese Government will hire foreign experts focused on the pillar and special industries in the western region .  Both the central and local governments will offer support and preferences in the form of increased expenditure and subsidies .  
Wan Xueyuan said the " transmission of oil from the west to the east " would be a symbolic project in China 's development of the western region in the 21st century .  Meanwhile , the booming special industries in the western region , which include the rare earth industry in Inner Mongolia , the development of herbal and biological medicine in the western provinces , and tomato and safflower processing in Xinjiang , all badly need intellectual support .  
Wan said that the grand occasion of international personnel and intellectual exchanges held in Xinjiang is a specific manifestation of the Chinese Government preparing personnel resources for implementing the strategy of developing the western region and implementing the project of guiding intellectual resources to the western region .  
The central mountain range runs from north to south , splitting Taiwan into east and west parts , and troops can only be deployed in the western part , in an area of under 10,000 square km .  
Second , as Anhui is the first stop in the industrial transference from the eastern region to the western region , we should take the initiative in receiving the radiation of the eastern region to develop our primary industry , and also spin-off projects and enterprises with certain technical content , good market prospects , and powerful pulling force to settle down in Anhui . 
The Central Propaganda Department held a meeting a few days ago to conscientiously study the spirit of General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech on the grand western development , stressing that the propaganda , ideological , and cultural fronts should resolutely carry out the strategic arrangements of the central authorities , show concern for the grand development , conduct propaganda on the grand development , give support to the grand development , stress political awareness , concentrate energies on implementation , bring real drive into full play , and do practical things for the grand western development .  
Jiang Zemin said that western development is a vast systems engineering , which is related to developing our vast land and also involves the production and daily life of the multiethnic masses ; it has to promote economic construction , and also achieve coordinated economic , resource , population , cultural , and environmental development ; there are very many strands to this work , which is very complex and arduous .  
Centering on this major topic of discussion , the members of the Central Committee will discuss various issues , such as adjusting the economic structure ; quickening the pace of reforming state-owned enterprises , the administrative management structure , the organizational structure , and the personnel system for cadres ; and putting forward concrete plans for finishing infrastructure construction in western China and transforming the ecological environment .  
They emphasized that in this significant period of advancing toward the new century , we should fully exercise the functions of the state power organs in our work , persist in enacting the law for the people , safeguard the fundamental interests of the people , do a good job in inspecting law enforcement and local legislation , and create a favorable legal environment for the grand development of China 's western region .  
The Ma Lai incident shows that during the 19th century Catholic missionaries took advantage of the imperialist gunboat policy to do all kinds of evil things in China , bully the Chinese people , cause incidents , and act as foot soldiers in scheming war against China , after which the western powers used the " missionary case " to launch a war of aggression against China and force it to sign an unequal treaty .  
In recent years , the Chinese Government has transcended the old pattern of regional economic development and formulated an overall approach for the development of central and western China in all dimensions , including construction of facilities , protection of the ecosystem , industrial adjustments , and advancement in science and technology and education .  The Ninth Five-Year Plan period has become an important phase in which China 's strategy of coordinated development of regional economy has fully rolled out and achieved initial successes .  
In September last year , the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee unequivocally put forward the strategy for the vigorous development of the west country , creating a powerful driving force for the development of central and western regions .  Economic cooperation and coordinated development on a nationwide scale will also take place at a higher and more comprehensive level .  
According to an analysis by an authoritative department , the highlights of the achievements made in the coordinated development of regional economy in China under the Ninth Five-Year Plan include the significant acceleration of economic development in central and western regions and the continuous emergence of economic " bright spots . "  
In the meantime , the living standards of the people in central and western regions have significantly improved ; the number of poor areas and impoverished people has continued to decrease ; and the gap between the actual incomes of urban and rural residents in eastern and western regions has somewhat narrowed .  
The industrial structure in central and western regions has also shown a tendency toward optimization , with the quality of economic operations significantly enhanced .  In the first four years under the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the relative size of the secondary industry in central and western regions steadily expanded ;  
As the industrial structure continues to be optimized , the level of coordination and cooperation between central-western regions and the eastern part of the country will also be continuously upgraded ; the traditional mode of interaction between the resource supplying bases and processing bases will be broken down ; and all-dimension exchanges in capital , technology , human resources , and information will take place between the eastern and western regions .  
The export growth forecast for various regions in the first half of this year indicates that export in central regions grew by nearly 32 percent , exceeding the growth level of less than 28 percent in eastern regions .  The export growth rate in western regions also reached 27 percent , close to the comparable level in eastern regions .  
Recently , Japan 's business circles have expressed their optimism in the correct macroeconomic policies adopted by the Chinese government to maintain the sustainable and rapid growth of the national economy and have shown keen interest in the new situation of China 's imminent entry into the WTO and its implementation of the strategy of developing the western region .  
The fact that such a large number of world economic magnates will assemble under the banner of developing China 's vast western region suffices to prove that the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision to develop the western region is wise , well-timed , and full of great potential .  
However , such a contrast does reflect , to a certain extent , a phenomenon , that is , unlike large-scale prominent enterprises in the overseas , some domestic enterprises fail to understand the historic opportunity arising from the development of the vast western region .  They lack the sense of urgency in grasping the opportunity .  It can not even be ruled out that some enterprises regard the party Central Committee 's strategic policy decision on the development of the western region as a political slogan .  
He indicated that he hopes that both sides will actively open up new areas of cooperation and new approaches to cooperation to bring economic and trade cooperation between the two countries to a new level .  In particular , the development of western China , new and advanced science and technology , and environmental protection , etc . , may become key items in mutually beneficial cooperation in the future .  
The state will very soon publish the favored treatment measures for supporting the great development of west China , including intensifying the shift of fiscal expenditure and construction funds , speeding up the pace of reforms and opening up in the western regions , and encouraging foreign businesses and other regions of China to invest in the west , and so on .  
The development of the eastern regions has been and remains an extremely important force in supporting the overall national economy in finance , material , and technology , and is also an indispensable condition for supporting the western development and the accelerated development of central and west China .  
According to the report , the " substantive " steps made in the large-scale western development since the beginning of this year include : Formulating and introducing the unified policies for the western development , losing no time in drafting the overall plan for the western development , carrying out the work to accelerate infrastructure construction , speeding up the work of ecological environment protection and construction , and intensifying the scientific and technological and educational work , among other things .

Taichung 's harbor and verdant outlying fields provide fresh fish and produce for busy city markets , and both the city and surrounding area are served by an efficient network of roads and railways , linking Taichung to centers in the north and south of Taiwan .  
The Chinese have a wide variety of small wrapped or stuffed foods similar to western dumplings or ravioli . Many tend to be sweet or rich , their preparation often time-consuming . Chicken Thread Wonton , however , is light and nutritious , as well as easy to prepare .  
The fundamental elements of western civilization , from columnar architecture , the aesthetic proportions of the human form and humanistic drama to geometric theorems , democracy and the theory of absolutism , all had their origin in the art and culture of ancient Greece .  
Ideally speaking , the doctor should have knowledge of western medicine , and a dialectic base in Chinese physiology and pathology . Then a complete checkup of the patient can be done . Physicians with more than three years of clinical experience are better skilled .  
Ideally this supposition is correct , but even in advanced western countries they have found that there seem to be considerable discrepancies between the views of lawmakers or the media and those of the average man in the street . It was thought that plutocratic influences or the pressure of interest groups might prevent real " grass-roots " opinions from being expressed ; so opinion polls were developed .  
I would like to express my personal appreciation of the two books I requested when subscribing to the magazine , In search of Photo Past ( , ) which offer the western reader beautiful , realistic and moving pictures of Taiwan life , the quality of which has seldom been equaled in photographic publications .  
Offshore to the east lies the longest coral reef in the western hemisphere . Most of the mountains are covered with dense primeval forests , home to more than 500 species of birds and thousands of varieties of butterflies . There are sanctuaries for jaguars and baboons and some 600 sites of the ancient Mayan civilization , making Belize a paradise for naturalists and anthropologists alike .  
The western seacoast was originally rising land , but because each of the two tributaries to the upstream portion of the Tsengwen River had dams built on them , plus a great amount of illegal pisciculture on the western seacoast , today reclaimed land on the seacoast is declining , not increasing . It would be very difficult to find a similar sandbank for the birds .  
Trying to say that a given number is either auspicious or ominous is mere superstition . Still , unlike the western sensitivity to the number 13 , Chinese have a whole philosophy built up around numbers , which is spread or experienced in real life .  
The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .  
Therefore , despite the fact that most of the people active in his books come from overseas , and his discussion of nativist matters is deeply imbued with western style thought patterns , he establishes a dialectical relationship with his theories ( phenomena ) and readers through his alluring and noble prose , the many levels on which his work can be understood , and his clear and persuasive method of reasoning .  
Except for a thin stretch of western Taiwan 's coastline settled by Chuanchow and Changchow Fukienese and a few Pingpu indigenous peoples , Shen was welcomed only by deep , forbidding mountains . The Han Chinese living on the coast called these " Fanshan , " or " savage mountains . "  
In 1987 , he finished a survey of the western section of the Ching dynasty Patungkuan Trail over Mt . Yushan , and uncovered many sections of well-preserved Ching stone paving . At the site of a Ching military camp , he collected numerous fragments of blue and white porcelain crockery , which were identified by the National Palace Museum as products of the Dehua kiln in Fujian Province .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
Shenghsing Railway Station : The highest point on western Taiwan 's mountain railway line . The structure contains no metal nails . The Eight Trigrams design fixed to the beams is intended to ward off evil . Between Shenghsing and Tai-an , the railway passes over bridges and through tunnels , past green farmland and countryside , with scenic spots such as the Yutengping river valley and the " broken bridge " at Lungteng , which was split in two by a great earthquake over 50 years ago .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
This has indirectly led to the disappearance of Central and South America 's rainforests , thus causing disruption to the global climate . Another instance is the transforming of the western deserts into oases to accommodate the surplus population in the eastern US . The several dams built along the Colorado River have nourished such states as California , Arizona and Nevada . But because the river has been blocked halfway , downstream in Mexico only a dry riverbed is left , leaving the people of Mexico with no water to use .  
The Dutch and the Cheng family simply held a series of strong points , while the authority of the Ching was limited to the western plain and a small part of the east coast . The mountain areas , inhabited by indigenous peoples , were not under central government control .  
Looking back in history , the entire area starting from Taipei 's Po-ai District - - where the Presidential Palace and other national governmental buildings are located - - and radiating out to Taipei 's western and southern districts , used to be named Dajiala . In the earliest period of Taiwan history , it was said to be the hunting grounds of the Ketagalan and an official site for worshipping their ancestors .  
This has led to land subsidence along both the eastern and western coasts . On a map of river water quality produced by the EPA , 50 of Taiwan 's major and minor rivers are colored black or brown from their mouths to their middle and upper reaches , indicating that they are heavily or moderately polluted .  
In the 1720s Burlington 's garden became something that had never been seen before . Its eastern section was in the formal classical style , with three radiating shaded avenues leading in straight lines to classical monuments . In the western part , though , Kent had created an irregular natural style , with groups of small trees and winding paths !  
Because the economic and political situations in the countries of western and central Africa are worse than in eastern and southern Africa , many countries are worried that after the ban is lifted there the impact on the elephant will be much more severe , so these concerned countries also cast negative votes at the CITES meeting .  
The main areas affected by land subsidence run down the western coastal plain from Changhua through Chia-yi , Yunlin and Tainan to Pingtung . Fish farming is prevalent in these counties , and ponds dot the entire area . The excessive pumping of ground water by these fish farmers is so severe that the elevation of towns and village in the area is dropping . This creates problems with drainage leading to frequent flooding .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
Lee Su Yue , herself having lived in a foreign land , has always been greatly touched by the story of the lonely and brokenhearted Wang Zhaojun , who was married out to a barbarian chieftain of the western hinterlands and buried in an alien country .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
A cutaway view of central Taiwan 's geological structure in east-west cross section reveals that the mountain ranges , plains , and foothills sit atop an extravagantly folded layer of rock cloven by numerous reverse faults . The resulting surface topography brings to mind the image of roof tiles , starting with the " eaves " in the west and running up the western face of the mountains to the peak .  
But do n't assume that the western plains are any safer . In the aftermath of the Chichi quake , people are dreading the destructive force of the Chelungpu fault . But examine a vertical section graphic of faults formed by the pressure from the movement of the plates . From east to west , you see the Lishan fault , the Shuangtung fault , the Chelungpu fault and the Changhua fault , which runs close to the Taiwan Strait .  
In Malaysia , Fujianese is widely used in the northern part of western Malaysia and in the southern part of Malaysia , in some places in eastern Malaysia , and especially in Penang , the small island that constitutes the major Chinese settlement in all of Malaysia . I 've never heard anyone call Fujian-ese fulaoren ( literally : " Fujian old chap " ) , because the character lao has a derogatory meaning among Chinese speakers in Malaysia . I hope in the future you will be cautious in using this term .  
Because the royal Li family of the Tang dynasty were descended from western and northern minorities , the Tang dynasty was deeply influenced by their culture , and the hunks of the Tang dynasty were all tall and broad-shouldered with strong physiques . These energetic men were excellent riders , archers , martial artists and swordsmen .  
In this way , the western part of the Southeast Asian littoral came within China 's sphere of influence . Furthermore , there were great profits to be had . Each expedition set out laden with silk and porcelain , to be exchanged for rare and precious commodities from overseas , and this too helps to explain why Zheng set sail on seven separate voyages .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
Over 2,000 years ago the Han Dynasty envoy Zhang Qian ( d . 114 BC ) traveled into the western regions , writing a great page in the history of global cultural interchange . Many important agricultural crops such as grapes , alfalfa and walnuts are reputed to have entered China at that time . 21 centuries later , in our age of highly developed international transport and commerce , the farming , forestry and fisheries industries play the role of modern Zhang Qians , importing countless weird and wonderful fruits , vegetables , birds and beasts .  
Taiwanese companies were among the major investors . In 2000 , mainland policymakers turned their attention to developing China 's western regions , and the culturally rich ancient capital Xi'an was anointed as the site of one of China 's four future " Silicon Valleys , " in addition to Beijing 's Zhongguancun , Shanghai 's Pudong , and the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone . These four centers each have their own strengths and weaknesses , and are intended to both compete and cooperate with each other .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
But what many people do not know is that in 1941 Kukeng experienced another major earthquake , which struck the Chiayi-Tainan area . The western face of a 1200-meter high mountain collapsed and fell into the Chingshui River . It formed a natural dam 100 meters high , and created a new lake , Lake Tsaoling , with a volume of 12.86 million cubic meters .  
The 23-kilometer-long old Mountain Line was built in 1908 , early in the Japanese colonial era . Trains on this line began by winding through the precipices of Sanyi Rural Township , and from there cut through mountains and crossed rivers . This was the last north-south line in western Taiwan to be completed , and the most difficult stretch of track from an engineering point of view , with nine tunnels and three bridges .  
In April , when the tung tree blossoms bloom , Taumi is a sea of snow white . In May , pink wild peonies crop up along the mountain trails . In June , wild ginger lilies in the western part of the community begin to give off a sweet fragrance . August , meanwhile , is when the Nakai podocarp tree - " the official tree of Taumi neighborhood " and a species unique to Taiwan-begins to fruit , presenting a remarkable picture of mixed red and green seeds and seed receptacles .  
However , 30 to 40 years ago , watercourses and paddy fields in the plains of western Taiwan , and in the Lanyang Plain to the east were full of native paradise fish . The fish were close companions of agricultural life , and because of the striking black-green spots on their gill covers they were known by many names , such as three-spot , cover-spot fighting fish , Taiwan fighting fish and Taiwan goldfish , as well as paradise fish .  
The eastern half is mountains and hills , the western half flat land . The mountain area is mostly planted with fruit trees and dry-field crops , while the plains-an appealing stretch of glossy green stretching as far as the eye can see-are rice paddies . When you also consider its former cultural sites , it is no surprise that Wufeng was always one of the main tourist attractions in central Taiwan .  
One experience I will never forget . At Easter , we traveled to the western regions of Queensland . We departed at 4 a.m . and drove past wheat farms , corn farms , crossing a huge broad land , from tall bush to short scrub , from gray-yellow land to bright red . It was fantastic !  
At the opening ceremony in Changhua , ROC president and master of ceremonies Chen Shui-bian remarked that the Sun Yat-sen Freeway represented the island 's first transportation revolution . Now the opening of National Highway No . 3 , in conjunction with the 12 high-speed east-west connectors and the main branch of the Western Coastal Expressway construction projects , as well as the high-speed railway ( scheduled to open at the end of 2005 ) , will turn the entire western corridor into a single living area and thus constitute nothing short of a second transportation revolution .  
After the western Taiwan high-speed transportation network is established , the future will bring construction projects for eastern , central and southern Taiwan where the terrain presents even greater difficulties ; and it can be predicted that the transportation , economic and environmental challenges will be greater , so that society will have greater expectations and exert more supervision .  
Back in the days when cities relied on rail transport , train stations were catalysts for commercial development . But thanks to Changhua 's geography , while the nice plain to the east of the station became a thriving commercial and residential area , the western side stayed so quiet you can just about see tumbleweeds roll past .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
He said that China succeeded in carrying out economic reforms in the frame of the original political system , while Russia , supported by western countries , had first embarked on political reform and become mired in financial crisis and heavy corruption  
the defense ministers of the two countries agreed in their talks to set up a rapid reaction multinational force to guarantee the security of southern europe the two ministers hoped that other member states of the western european union would join the multinational force  
despite all these favorable factors , however , germany 's economic recovery will be weak and slow this is because the country 's labor cost is still high , its social welfare burdens are heavy , and the recovery in other major western economies still lacks steam  
Dominique Casier , FBA chairman and chief representative of the Beijing Office of the General Bank of Belgium , told the conference that foreign financial institutions are interested in Henan 's economic construction and in developing other central and western areas  
This blockade is being accompanied daily by heavy artillery shelling and murderous air-raids which have resulted in numerous casualties among innocent civilians in southern Lebanon and in the western Bekaa and caused considerable material damage .  
The loss of life , the destruction of property , the disruption of the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians living in the western Beqaa and South Lebanon now seriously aggravated by the interdiction imposed by the Israeli naval blockade on thousands of fishermen to carry on their only gainful activity , are all acts of blatant Israeli defiance of the precepts of international law and Security Council resolutions 425 ( 1978 ) , 426 ( 1978 ) and 509 ( 1982 ) .  
To the contrary , recent developments in eastern and western Bosnia and Herzegovina offer ample proof that the Belgrade Government and , specifically Mr . Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , has not only failed to influence the so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs positively , but has effectively encouraged them to intensify their military option and ethnic cleansing .  
Following the massive crimes in western Slavonia in May 1995 committed by the Croatian forces , which resulted in territory cleansed of Serbs , Croatia is now resorting to the same method in the Krajina , namely , the media and international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations representative are denied access to the area before all incriminating traces are removed .  
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
The Islamic State of Afghanistan would like to assure you that the freedom-loving people of Afghanistan do realize their prime national obligation to liberate the western parts of Afghanistan , including occupied Herat , and to force the Pakistani militia out of the area by a general and resolute armed struggle , in favour of the country 's political and administrative unity .  
It is particularly outrageous that Croatia should blame the Serbs for aggression when it is quite clear that the regular army of Croatia has been guilty of horrendous atrocities committed in western Slavonia , the Krajina and Bosnia and Herzegovina , which have resulted in the slaughter of thousands of Serbs and the burning and looting of their homes .  
The offensive in western Bosnia , whose ultimate goal is the seizure of Prijedor and Banja Luka , is continuing unabated despite the demands of the Security Council contained in the presidential statement of 12 October 1995 ( S / PRST / 1995 / 52 ) , that all parties fully comply with the provisions of the cease-fire agreement and refrain from any military activity that could seriously jeopardize the peace process . 
It is expected of the international community to respond to the biggest ethnic cleansing carried out so far in the territory of the former Yugoslavia , following Croatia 's brutal aggression against the Serb Krajina and after joint Muslim-Croat attacks on traditionally Serb ethnic territories in western and north-western Bosnia , even after a cease-fire agreement was announced .  
The massive exodus of almost the entire Serb population from Krajina and western Slavonia , preceded by the previous exodus of over 300,000 Serb population from Croatia outside Krajina , as well as military intervention of the regular units of the Croatian army in Western Bosnia served the purpose of the current leadership of Croatia to create " Greater Croatia " , i.e . , an ethnically pure State without the Serbs .  
NAJEM ( Lebanon ) said that Israel was responsible for flagrant and persistent violations of human rights in the occupied territories of southern Lebanon , the western Bekaa and surrounding areas .  
Further evidence of this is the dangerous , irresponsible , uncontrolled and unregulated intrusion of this organization 's aircraft , for purposes other than providing air service , into a zone of significant international civil aviation activity and one of the most active international air corridors of the western hemisphere .  
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
But how many millions of these cold , cruel and silent enemies still await our unsuspecting and innocent civilian population in remote areas of the country near the western border ? 
Following the demise of the Soviet Union and the socialist bloc , which laid the foundations for undisputed hegemony , the United States , with the constant support of its western allies , began an unrestrained race to transform the Security Council into a kind of supreme universal tribunal for passing judgement on any country that disobeyed its designs and for using troops assembled under the flag of the United Nations as a planet-wide police force . 
Condemning Israel 's continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa in flagrant violation of international law and in continuing disregard of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and relevant subsequent resolutions ,  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its continued occupation of parts of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa ; and to call upon the international community , and upon the United Nations and all its associated bodies in particular , to strive for the implementation of Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) and the relevant subsequent resolutions calling for Israel 's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from all occupied Lebanese territory to the internationally recognized boundaries ;  
To appeal to international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
This requires : complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan to the line of 4 June 1967 ; complete and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa to the internationally recognized boundaries ; the complete withdrawal of Israel from all occupied Palestinian territories , including Arab Jerusalem ; and recognition of the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its right to exercise self-determination and establish an independent State on its own soil . 
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the second half of June 1996 .  
In the light of the cooperation existing between the League of Arab States and the OAU in this respect , sees that the proposal of the Arab League to hold a neutral and just trial for the two suspects before Scottish judges , under Scottish law in The Hague , with the necessary guarantees for the suspects , a proposal which has received wide international support , is a proper practical solution to end the crisis , that is why the three western countries are invited to consider that proposal .  
On 17 October 1995 , at hearings held by the subcommittee of the United States Congress for indigenous and western hemisphere affairs , the representative of the President of the United States , Mr . Geoffrey L . Farrow , who was also the co-chairman of the inter-agency working group on Puerto Rican affairs , had stated that the current impasse would continue until the Federal Government faced up to its responsibilities in the matter and gave real content to its policy of support for the self-determination of Puerto Ricans .  
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the first half of July 1996 .  
A positive example for landlocked countries that lie in the centre of continents is that of Switzerland and Austria , which have served as successful hosts for short-cut routes through the Alps , providing connections from northern and western Europe to southern and eastern Europe - with notable benefits to their own economies , among the world 's most successful and richest .  
On instructions from my Government , and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which Israel engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place during the second half of July and in August 1996 .  
In many countries , although scarcity is less of a problem at the national level , overuse of groundwater , contributing to waterlogging and salinity , has become a major problem in specific regions , such as northern China , western and southern India and parts of Mexico . 
Over the past few years , higher international prices , new mining codes with more clearly defined rights and obligations of foreign investors , and aid-financed geologic surveys had contributed to a large increase in the exploration for mineral deposits and with notable success .  Gold production in particular has increased rapidly in several countries in western and southern Africa .  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its persistence in making repeated attacks on Lebanese territory ; and to appeal to the international community , international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory , particularly for the attack it launched against Lebanon during April 1996 , and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
To condemn the persistent Israeli violations of human rights in the occupied regions of southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa , as exemplified by the kidnapping and arbitrary arrest of civilians and the destruction of their homes , the confiscation of their property and their expulsion from their land , as well as by the shelling of peaceful villages and urban areas ;  
The follow _ up process has engaged the national authorities at the highest level through a number of initiatives towards friendly countries and international institutions as well as the private sector ; these have involved traditional western and Arab donors , but also countries such as Brazil , the Republic of Korea , Malaysia , and Eastern European countries . 
It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
A substantial part of those losses resulted from the disruption of the traditional commercial route for Bulgarian exports to central and western Europe through Yugoslav territory , which caused a considerable scaling-down of economic relations with countries from that part of the continent .  
Insecurity in the northern and western regions of Rwanda , where numerous vulnerable populations are located , reduced the access of humanitarian workers to the areas , with accompanying reductions in the reach and scope of humanitarian programmes .  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
In many ways the performance of the Canadian economy last year was closer to that of western Europe than that of the United States : annual growth averaged some 1.5 per cent , rather less than in 1995 ; relatively weak labour markets and increased taxes held back the growth of personal disposable income , although consumption picked up to a large extent because of a steep fall in the savings ratio ; and business fixed investment is also more concerned with rationalization than expanding capacities .  
Some of the specific ongoing research projects include : predictive study on trends in the life-supporting environment in China over the next 20 to 50 years ; dynamic processes and prediction of trends in environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions of China ; research on global environmental change in Antarctica ; the field experiment in the Heihe river basin on the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface ; experiments on ocean circulation in the tropical western Pacific ; and studies on the formation , evolution and environmental changes of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau .  
On 21 October 1996 , at 10.08 hours , crew members of scheduled flight CU-170 of Cubana de Aviaci \ x { 93ee } ( Cuban Airlines ) , on board a Fokker-27 aircraft , flying the Havana-Las Tunas route , upon crossing the Gir \ x { 93ee } air corridor in the western region of Cuba , noticed a single-engine airplane flying from north to south , at about 1,000 feet ( 300 metres ) above them , apparently spraying or sprinkling unknown substances - some seven times - in an intermittent manner .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
The area , densely populated and containing the economic , social and cultural heart of the country , included the scenic capital Plymouth , located on the volcanos western flank .  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
The remaining objects are listed under the L category , which means that they are librating ( oscillating ) around the so-called eastern stable point at 75 degrees east longitude ( L1 category ) , western stable point at 107 degrees west longitude ( category L2 ) or even around both points ( L3 category ) . 
There are two priorities in addressing the situation in western Timor : first , the Indonesian Government must provide all necessary security measures to secure both refugees and humanitarian agencies , maintain the civilian character of refugee sites , and facilitate humanitarian activities ; second , whatever option refugees will choose return , remain or go elsewhere in Indonesia it will have to be free and informed , impartially ascertained , respected and fulfilled . 
Other central regions and western and southeastern regions were also affected , but the economic and social consequences in those regions are less severe than in the more vulnerable northeastern and eastcentral regions .  
The classic western position of prompt , adequate and effective compensation required , inter alia , that compensation be based on the value at the time of taking and that it be made in convertible currency , without restrictions on repatriation . 
However , the tragic murder in August of seven Afghan workers of the United Nationssupported mine awareness programme by an unidentified armed band in western Afghanistan confirmed the everyday risks faced by humanitarian personnel .  
The problems in Africa have only worsened , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and in mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and members of criminal organizations who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
It was assumed that the end of colonialism , the cold war and apartheid would relieve the sufferings of many African peoples ; instead , the situation has deteriorated further , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and criminal gangs who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
The fourth edition of the World Banks Poverty Trends and Voices of the Poor , 2001 reports on recent progress in poverty reduction for selected countries on the basis of data derived primarily from surveys using national poverty lines , not the $ 1 a day poverty line . 1 In East Asia , the sharp decline in poverty in China during the 1990s was accompanied by widening income inequality between the countrys more rural western provinces and the more industrialized east , which probably slowed the overall rate of poverty reduction for the country . 
However , it is now well known that SPLM / A , continuing its intransigent stance , not only vehemently opposed the proposed immediate ceasefire , but also provoked the situation by launching intensive military operations in western Bahr-El-Ghazal state , causing the loss of the lives of a considerable number of innocent civilians and the displacement of thousands of others , thus creating , once again , a humanitarian crisis in the state and its immediate environs , as it did in early 1998 .  
The proposed operational and logistics base would be established at Kindu , which is located at the western fringe of an area characterized by many of the military , security , political and humanitarian and human rights problems that MONUC is likely to be confronted with in phase III .
