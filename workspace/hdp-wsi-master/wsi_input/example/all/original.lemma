Some visitors noticed a pile of white dust and wondered why it could not be blown away ; actually it was a work of art by a Japanese ceramics creator - - made from burnt aluminum ( the original ingredient of pottery ) .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
The game became popular in the Huangyen area of Zhejiang in the Taokuang reign ( 1821-1851 ) . The rules were as follows : First , the names of 34 famous people of old were written down . Then the game master would select one at random , and place it in a box . Then the players would bet which one it was , with the winner taking home 30 times the original wager .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
The most marked characteristic of traditional Bunun garb is the pocket-like pouch worn at the chest by Bunun men , called a kulin . Men 's clothes feature colored patterns on a white background , with the main patterns being on the back , whereas women 's clothes are mainly black . According to custom , Bunun women can not wear brightly colored clothing because of their " original sin . "  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
According to the original recipe , the beef is first sliced and placed on top of the cooked noodles , then a superior stock made from chicken bones , medicinal herbs , shrimp sauce , fish sauce and so on is poured in ; lastly various raw vegetables such as chiutsengta and purple perilla are added , along with local herbs and leaves .  
They used a white glaze on which they painted decorative panels , or landscapes and pavilions , in blue enamel . Delft ware : the first Chinoiserie " The potters of that time made brilliant copies ; from a distance you ca n't tell them from original Chinese ware , " Mr . Koster observes as he guides us through Royal Delft 's exhibition rooms . Delft ware was a great success on the markets of the time , and later gradually moved away from imitating Ming blue-and-white ware , to develop its own distinctive style .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Later on , the Puli Township public works bureau took the initiative to recruit scholars and relevant administrative agencies , holding the Puli High School Tamalin Ruins Investigative Conference , at which they decided a full-scale excavation ought to take place at the original test dig site . Up through the middle of April , the archaeological dig kept going .  
The 71-year-old Liu has many " firsts in Taiwan dance " to her credit . She was the first to earn a doctorate in dance ; the first to record aboriginal dance ; and the first to go abroad to copy original choreographic notation of ancient Chinese dance , which she then reconstructed and staged . Now in her sixth year since " retiring , " she is still teaching and choreographing non-stop .  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult . By studying it again and again she came to appreciate the tremendous ingenuity of many aspects of Su Song 's original design , and solved many riddles ( see " How the Astronomical Clock Tower Worked " ) .  
Thus , perhaps we should take a more balanced attitude toward those scholars who were then so anxious to collect and preserve aboriginal culture , and who took every opportunity to introduce and promote the music across national boundaries . Otherwise , if everybody puts " self-interest " ahead of everything else in this dispute , this will definitely run counter to the original significance of the " Song of Joy " that has survived for so many years and that Difag made famous .  
This is of course sharing honor belonging to Sima Guang [ the original author ] , but I did make two contributions : ( 1 ) I made recondite classical Chinese understandable , and ( 2 ) I have given Chinese-or foreigners interested in uncovering the splendor of Chinese history-a chance to gain a complete familiarity by reading just one work . Nothing can substitute for it .  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
The mix of Chinese and barbarian was at first a matter of necessity . But since it has continually renewed and reproduced itself , with the efforts of each new generation , there has been a qualitative change . If individual cells in the primordial soup can come together to form a new organism , this organism is not just a mechanical combination of the original cells , but is an organic " creation . "  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
And , because the Three Kingdoms requires a knowledge of military tactics , it pushes players to study history more deeply outside the game . Tu 's son , a fifth grader , has carefully read a colloquial Chinese translation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms ( the original is written in the difficult classical Chinese ) in order to better play the game , allowing his father to see the game 's charm firsthand .  
For instance , in the Four Pillars case , if the firm is found guilty , there will be criminal fines ( under the EEA , the maximum fine is US $ 5 million ) , as well as possible compensation in the civil suit . One can imagine a scenario in which all the profits for encroaching on intellectual rights over these past few years will enter the coffers of the American government and the original manufacturer , meaning that the efforts of the copying firms were all for other people 's gain .  
Taiwan composer Ma Shui-lung affirms Wong 's heartfelt efforts . But , purely from a musical point of view , he feels that the arrangements could be broader and deeper . Though it is great that popular tunes can be arranged to be more edifying without losing their common touch , it is also worth performing truly original works ; after all , the space for Chinese music is broad .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
Some four years ago , when the architects responsible for renovating the Li Family Compound had the Lotus Flower Pool changed from its original irregular oval shape into the usual traditional half-moon shape , 77-year-old Li Yen Hsiu-feng , chairperson of the Li Family Compound management committee , insisted it be torn up and redone .  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
For example , traditionally most museums have had permanent collections built around a specific theme . But very often their artifacts are far removed from their places of origin , cutting off their connection to their original environment , thereby obscuring much of their contextual meaning .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level . The resulting reservoir will be 300 kilometers across and the catchment area will cover 19 cities and counties including 300 smaller townships .  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
Santa Claus and the department stores team up to hoodwink innocent , trusting little children , and the original religious meaning of Christmas has been replaced by a superficial " eat , drink , and be merry " approach to the holidays . This has happened because industrialized society is pulling away from its agrarian roots .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
Moving further into the garden , you find a motorcyclist popping a wheelie across the lawn , a sprinter racing over the low hurdles , a high jumper doing the Fosbury flop , and other athletes doing stretches , gymnastic routines with hula hoops , etc . All these works are part of the Living World Series . Each life-sized athlete is made of painted bronze cast upon a mold formed from an original work made of tightly bound sponge .  
However , Columbia University professor and literary critic Wang Dewei feels that Gao Xingjian is a highly innovative writer with original ideas , and that a combination of factors including his fame overseas , his literary status , his creative style and his accessibility surely make him a fitting choice to receive the prize , whether on behalf of Chinese authors or of writers in exile .  
A : The original work itself is a highly ambitious novel , and a very successful one too . There is a sort of " sympathetic resonance " in this book between the uncertain social status of homosexuals and the uncertain international status of Taiwan itself . This resonance carries the significance of the novel to a higher level . Notes of a Desolate Man goes beyond mere description of the love lives of homosexuals .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
The appeal of a divine being that loves all mankind did n't find a ready audience in Chinese who still had their original brush with the West-looking down the barrel of a gun-fresh in their memories ; people were suspicous of the relationship between Christian doctrine and economic interests ; and they got life-saving medicine side-by-side with life-destroying opium . People were not well educated and standards of living were low , so there was fear and prejudice against foreign culture .  
Director Stanley Kwan cut certain inflammatory portions of the original work , employing a plain narrative style to tell the story in a matter-of-fact way . In the absence of the exhibitionist language seen in earlier works of Kwan 's , Wen Tien-hsiang qualifies the final version as " accessible without being low-brow . "  
This goes far beyond Huang 's original expectations , for he was motivated solely by a love for the aesthetic sensibility of Victorian England , with the delicate beauty of its art , architecture , furniture , and decorative style . That is precisely what is lacking in Taiwan , where people have spent the last several decades pouring most of their energies into economic development .  
Italy 's " Slow Down the City " campaign was initiated by the mayor of a small Italian town . The campaign has also extended to the preservation of traditional vineyards threatened by multinational firms and industrialized farms , and restaurants have refused to accept " fast-food culture , " insisting on maintaining their original regional cuisines . Seventy Italian cities have already joined the campaign .  
" Hilltop Hunk , " adapted from a Japanese tune and performed by Hung Yi-feng , sold big in the 1960s . The record company took a shine to Hung and paired him up with Yeh Chun-lin to create a string of completely original works , thus bucking the trend at a time when songs adapted from Japanese tunes dominated . This development was a shot in the arm for the long-moribund market for natively produced Taiwanese pop . The new native tunes were featured in movies and spurred a third golden age in the Taiwanese genre .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
The work has and will stand the test of time because of its clever design that utilizes the original splendid coloration ( a mixture of white and green ) and the remarkable carving that rendered a piece of jade into a life-like cabbage with two katydids on top of it . The work , however , also shows jade carvings ' traditional limitations .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
Theoretically , a rice wine unadulterated by ethanol should be more aromatic and tasty . But people still preferred the original formula . After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .  
Art critic Wang Chia-chi points out that Installation Art in Taiwan is basically written from the creative perspective of the artist , expressing both sympathy and empathy for the subject matter covered . As such , when Yao explains works , he strives to fathom the original creative intent of each artist . In consequence , the book has some commentary but is bereft of any clear , forceful critiques .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .  
Immediately after the war , Lung Ying-tsung edited the literature section of the Japanese-language China Daily and published a collection of informal essays entitled The Lonely Bookworm in Japanese . In this post-war period , he also wrote Qingtian Bairi Qi , a novel that describes the innermost feelings of Taiwanese youth welcoming the end of Japanese rule , and A Man from Swatow , which depicts the inner conflicts and sense of original sin felt by Taiwanese during the war . Lung withdrew from Taiwan 's literary circles in the 1950s .  
I 've noticed a trend : in recent years , a large number of works that have entered the market have been from the mainland-both original Chinese and translated works-and this has become one of the causes of the current rapid expansion of the Taiwanese book market . Moreover , these books are n't limited to the old academic and translated works , they 've now grown to include popular literature .  
But neglected all along was the Aborigines ' viewpoint and what they had to say , " points out Sun Ta-chuan . He gives an example : developing the water resources of the mountain regions was for the benefit of those downstream , while the Aborigines living upstream were frequently without potable water . When the mountain regions were included in national parks , the Aborigines were forced to leave the area , losing their original living space and sacred territory , and they were cut off from their traditional cultural roots .  
It was also at this time that the family adopted corporate management methods . On display alongside the shoulder pole-with its dark , shiny surface hinting at a long history-are a number of other important historical mementos from the company 's past , including a ceiling beam , a brick , and a foundation stone quarried in northern Taipei 's Chili-an district . All these items were taken from the original building before it was torn down to be replaced by the new company headquarters building .  
" What 's original with me is that after folding the wing into a very normal flat shape , I improved the structure by further folding the wings into triangle shapes that attached to the middle of the fuselage . Finally , there is the square fold of a stabilizer wing beneath the fuselage . That was the most difficult part .  
" To get that outside money , they accommodated more and more tourists , ripping up the mountains to lay large parking lots , trails and pavilions , " says Lai Peng-chih , who previously served as secretary-general of the Taiwan Ecotourism Association . " They replaced their original structures built out of natural materials with concrete buildings . " This development had a major impact on the environment , Lai says , disturbing the growth of plants and animals .  
In 2000 , the Yushan Weather Station expansion project was finally completed , with the original 100-square-meter wooden hut expanded into a 160-square-meter steel frame structure with a sheet-metal roof . At the same time , new equipment , such as a live video feed system , was added . The number of photovoltaic panels and power storage batteries was also increased , as a result of which the power supply was improved .  
This lowered his morale . Due to these frustrations , there was a time when Wang considered giving up . But then he considered his original vow to help , and also how he himself had had discipline problems in school : fighting , bullying , low grades . The affirmation and care he received then from his church elders guided him out .  
While these newer materials were easy to use and quick to apply , they constituted a heavy outer layer that caused the temple to lose its original , classical feel . Furthermore , these materials stifled the original wood so that the resulting build-up of humidity encouraged termite infestations .  
Built to last " This project has struck a balance between using modern preservation techniques and traditional crafts . The utmost effort has been made to restore the original historical appearance of the site , and the careful attention to detail is highly significant in both religious and architectural terms . "  
After base areas are set up at Meifeng , vegetable crops suitable for cool , high elevations can be planted by machine instead of by hand ; fruit trees too are planted in rain-sheltered systems and managed for increased yields . The wooded areas that separate cultivated fields from the original land provide staged filtration of contaminants from rainwater runoff . Meifeng 's soil management methods have proven effective enough to preserve its resources over an eight-year period that has seen numerous typhoons and the 921 earthquake .  
He said that China succeeded in carrying out economic reforms in the frame of the original political system , while Russia , supported by western countries , had first embarked on political reform and become mired in financial crisis and heavy corruption  
Aware that the voluntary repatriation of large numbers of Somali refugees in neighbouring countries and elsewhere , as well as the return of internally displaced persons to their original homes , will still require a planned and integrated international assistance programme designed to cover their basic needs , ensure adequate reception arrangements and facilitate their smooth integration into their respective communities ,  
The original mandate of the Force has been enlarged by subsequent Security Council resolutions in response to the constantly changing political situation and , as stated in paragraph 6 above , the Council decided on 31 March 1995 to replace UNPROFOR with three separate but interlinked peace-keeping operations . 
In the case of Belarus the problem of outstanding contributions for peace-keeping operations has taken on a particularly acute , and it would not be exaggerated to say , offensive character , primarily owing to the fact that the original motives for assigning Belarus to group ( b ) have become historically obsolete , its legal status under international law has changed and its economic situation has greatly deteriorated . 
Although some of the problems raised , such as remuneration of personnel employed in peace-keeping operations and more extensive use of United Nations Volunteers is of concern to JIU and are actually reflected in its report on staffing of the United Nations peace-keeping and related missions ( civilian component ) ( JIU / REP / 93 / 6 ) , it is difficult to make any substantive comments without access to the original records .  
In that light , the Russian delegation joined the sponsors of the original draft resolution on multilingualism , and guided by the spirit of compromise and having tried to ensure that the comments expressed at previous meetings were taken into account as fully as possible , is prepared to support the draft in its revised form . 
With regard to the new text of draft article 21 , Slovenia felt that the original intention to include in a single group both crimes against humanity as recognized by customary law on the basis of the Charter of the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal , which applied only in time of war , and systematic and massive violations of human rights , represented an attempt to further the progressive development of international law .  
Therefore , my delegation had proposed to the original sponsors a simple preambular paragraph which would have located the comprehensive test-ban treaty as a significant disarmament step in a phased programme leading eventually to the total elimination of nuclear weapons in a specific or even reasonable time-frame . . . . . . .  
The management stated , in its response , that the original request for proposal dated 1 August 1990 was formulated with the objectives of ( a ) identifying a state-of-the-art access control system that would generally meet the technical and security requirements of the United Nations and ( b ) identifying prospective contractors capable of supplying such a system .  
The Advisory Committee was informed , upon inquiry , that the revised requirements for contractual services of $ 8.3-million , which reflects a decrease of $ 11.7-million compared with the original estimates of $ 20.0-million , are based on the actual terms of the contract signed in July 1995 between the United Nations and the logistic support services contractor .

This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
Considering the late stage of our work , and given the importance that my delegation attached to the full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the work of the Preparatory Commission in this regard , and in the spirit of cooperation , we decided not to insist on our original proposal on the work of the Preparatory Commission and agreed to language that was incorporated in A / C . 1 / 51 / L . 48 / Rev . 1 as a new operative paragraph 6 .  
What began originally as a displacement from the licit to the illicit sector in a small number of key countries in east Asia , Europe and North America now shows every sign of diffusing beyond those original focal areas into neighbouring ones .  
The revised cost estimates submitted in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 1 of 30 October 1995 amounted to $ 890,230,900 gross ( $ 881,791,500 net ) , compared to the original estimates of $ 1,013,629,900 gross ( $ 1,002,021,100 net ) and took into consideration reduced requirements for military and civilian personnel , rental of premises , transport operations , air operations and the purchase of equipment .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
Within the original framework of the Charter , democracy was understood as essential to efforts to prevent future aggression , and to support the sovereign State as the basic guarantor of human rights , the basic mechanism for solving national problems and the basic element of a peaceful and cooperative international system .  
For the United Nations to make a difference and provide leadership in today 's complex world , it must recover the original meaning of the Charter by concentrating on its essential mission : maintaining international peace and security , promoting justice and international law , strengthening cooperation for development , protecting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance .  
Whereas in its original proposal for 1997 the Tribunal had requested approximately $ 69 million net to fund the activities of the Chambers , the Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry , which represented a 94 per-cent increase over the 1996 budget and included provision for an additional 197 posts , the review conducted by the Oversight Office had identified at least $ 6 million in savings , including 39 unnecessary and duplicated posts as well as various plans for non-essential spending such as sophisticated audio-visual equipment .  
This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
An expert involved in the Uganda Connect project pointed to a highly original way of overcoming existing limitations through the use of donated older PCs which are linked up through a hybrid technology using VHF single side band radio communications .

He added mysterious cults including tien ting ( imperial court ) , chu hsieh ( banishing evil ) , chang sheng ( longevity ) and cheng hsien ( immortality ) to the original ideology .  
To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
Looking at the cloisonne duck , we see a smooth and curved but , none theless , strong and powerful neck , supporting a rather small and frail head . The surface of the duck is smooth , the roughness and sharp angles of the original lump of bronze eliminated . The beauty of this piece of cloisonne is further seen by the many different " layers " of ruffled feathers , contributing to the life-like image .  
I 'm only helping to preserve them for their descendents , " Gao says . He has had offers to sell his collection for prices as high as five times the original cost , but is determined to eventually hand it over to a cultural organization for proper care and display . Prof . Gao has written many articles for magazines about aboriginal items , hoping to kindle interest and encourage scholarly work in native Taiwan cultures .  
The chair on display is covered in green upholstery , moves smoothly on casters and is meticulously carved with intricate floral designs . Called a lady 's chair by the maker , it is based on an original from Britain 's Victorian era , and has a " gentleman 's chair " companion piece . It is one of many included in what is in effect a renaissance of European furniture styles in Taiwan .  
Surrounded by mountains , the original beauty of its well-planted trees , butterflies , singing birds , wildlife , and lush vegetation , has been preserved by its remote location and its relatively unknown state . Recently , however , the roads to this area have been developed and its fame has spread .  
This highly original game show features married couples working together , and separately , to answer questions relating to their marriage . The results have proven both humorous and moving . Positive viewer response indicates that " Happy Family " is not only widely enjoyed , but also significantly upgrades viewers attitudes towards marriage . The show is broken into many segments giving the viewer a well paced and fresh ninety minutes of viewing enjoyment .  
Fresh seafood is arranged in front of Temple Entrance restaurants , where the customers can select their own seafood and have it prepared to their taste . Others may prefer to buy spring rolls , rice cakes , curry or noodle dishes , tempura , or oyster omelets at the smaller stands , and top them off with a dessert of traditional sweets or luscious pre-cut fruits . Keelung , whether by means of bright new public construction or traditional local color , has managed to overcome the original drab appearance caused by its rainy weather .  
Lu reports that one day in the late nineteenth century , a chef for an official family heard his employer singing the praises of a great dish he had just eaten , an exquisite meal of duck and chicken baked in a wine jug . The first efforts at imitation were less than ideal , so the official took the cook to the original house to learn it straight from the wife who had prepared the dinner . Later , when the chef started his own restaurant , he kept adding to and improving the recipe .  
Wings of Glory Representing the glorious tradition of the Chinese air command , the Chinese Air Force Academy stands as a landmark in modern military training . Originally founded in 1932 by the late President Chiang Kai-shek , the school has grown from its original humble origins near Hangchou , to its present modern facility in Kaohsiung County , southern Taiwan .  
And even Ch'ien-lung had his lapses . Museum experts discovered that a favorite painting from the Yuan dynasty ( 1279-1368 ) , which he had covered with imperial seals and comments , was really a copy and the alleged imitation was the true original .  
The chief reason is the back wings of the male monarch , which , seen against the light , change from their original gold to red , to green , to purple and blue , like a kaleidoscope or a prism in the sun . "  
Read in the light of contemporary trends , Ch'en 's work may seem no longer fresh or original in conception and rather to await further exploration of its potential . But among the paths taken by Taiwan photographers in the 1960s , Ch'en 's development , from amateur realistic photographer to a sketcher of imagistic scenery , can be considered representative .  
The materials can be divided into several major categories : chia-ku wen remains ( oracular bone inscriptions ) , ancient artifacts , original editions , government documents from the Ming and Ching dynasties , local records , and modern historical documents .  
The most sought-after qualities for the traditional Taiwanese opera are a beautiful and intricate voice , figure , and acting skill . To accommodate the television medium , with its fast and furious pace , much of the complex vocals and acting have been cut out . It 's unavoidable that the original flavor of the operas is lost .  
In order to ensure normal economic growth and release inflationary pressure , the Central Bank decided to adopt a policy of financial stringency as from March of this year and the money supply growth rate has steadily fallen from its original 30% ; another factor which caused there to be less cash in circulation in Taiwan was purchases of foreign currency by many people who anticipated that the NT dollar would depreciate .  
The " Civil Service Performance Review Law " which has just passed its third reading in the Legislative Yuan is sending a little " red envelope " to all government employees in time for the new year : The content of the civil service performance review bonus has been changed from " base pay " to " full pay . " This will almost double the original amount , making civil servants ' wallets once again a subject of after-dinner discussion .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics . We need the government to set up a seed source bank to preserve these , while at the same time encouraging private enterprise to develop new improved varieties .  
My fieldwork was carried out before the communist occupation of the mainland , when the streets and historic buildings were in good shape and Chinese culture was well maintained . I travelled south of the Yangtze by boat , rode on horseback , and travelled by wooden handcart on the loess plain , genuinely experiencing the original China at first hand .  
Nevertheless , although it is impossible to fully articulate the original cultural environment , still , the ultimate meaning behind the culture on the psychological level can transcend time and space and be expressed on the stage .  
Chen Yu-feng explains that the forests which have been able to overcome Taiwan 's harsh land are called " special flora which has adapted to an unstable ground quality over a long period of time . " in botany . One of its most important features is that " it is very difficult to restore an area to the original condition after the surface has been stripped away , and this will initiate a long-term , intensive chain reaction . "  
In the era when " cutting trees for foreign exchange " was the principal aim of the Republic of China 's forest policy , the Yuli District Forest Office preserved a stand of 60 stout camphor trees by the middle stretches of the Chingshui River . As the only remaining virgin tract of stout camphors , which are broad-leafed trees native to Taiwan , the stand has today become an essential resource in an effort to return Chingshui River to its original ecology .  
Due to the binding of clan ties and the manpower required by farming , not only has it not been altered , but its original three-sided courtyard building has seen the addition of 13 auxiliary hu-lung ( protective dragon ) buildings at its sides , creating living space for a clan of some 200 families in two blocks .  
Otherwise , if one just adopts the form outright , it could turn out like the Hsiu Lang Elementary School in Yungho : The newly built four story school building is a four-sided ( fully enclosed ) ho-yuan , but because an activities center was added to the courtyard , the school thus became an enormous resonance chamber . The only thing the school could do was to restrict the children from running about , thus contradicting the original spirit of the large communal compound .  
In Mexico , for example , 12.5 square meters of forest are burned for each 11 kilograms of formula produced . Waste from the cows creates vast amounts of methane , adding to global warming . It requires a great deal of energy to manufacture dry powdered milk from the original milk . Packaging requires the expenditure and waste of large amounts of tin , aluminum , and plastic ; for example in the U . S . 550 million empty formula tins are discarded annually , while Taiwan throws away about five million .  
In our original conception , there would be nine items for evaluation - - those being , besides the eight main powers of legislators , also adding one item for " constituent service . " There are four criteria for evaluation - - whether the legislator effectively promotes a balance with the executive ; whether the legislator 's attitude in interpellations is reasonable ; the extent to which expressed political views are realized in practice ; and whether or not the legislator follows the constitution . ( However , we do n't include ideology . )  
The domestic environmental protection industry still is quite a bit behind international standards , and the gap is unbridgeable in incinerator beds and in prevention of air pollution from emissions . Thus this set of domestic bidding restrictions includes a proviso : The domestic firm that wins the bid must cooperate with an original manufacturer from the United States or Europe to import the technology and undertake joint responsibility for the projects .  
Since permitting visits to mainland China , many temples have contended to host Matsu icons from the original Matsu Temple at Meichou , Fukien . Each statue brought over to Taiwan shows a demure , adolesent goddess , dressed in embroidered red , with delicate three-inch bound feet . That 's completely different from the full-faced , majestic and graceful adult woman that is the Matsu familiar in Taiwan .  
Before planting 20 million trees : Countries which attach importance to planning prefer to coordinate according to available land resources . For example , when a new residential area was being developed in the Roehampton district of London , it went through detailed planning with the original trees all being kept and protected just as though it were a park . Places such as the special tree-shaded walkway in Berlin , and innumerable other examples , could also be cited .  
The owner of one old wooden house , no longer willing to put up with rotting sills and doorposts , had his home rebuilt ; but although he no longer used wood as a material , he retained the original upper halves of the walls , along with the lion 's -head panel over the doorway , achieving not a bad compromise in keeping alive the traditional folk customs and beliefs .  
The custom of raising havoc in the bridal chamber reaches back into the mists of Chinese history ; maybe it really is a " unique treasure of Chinese culture . " But as it has changed and evolved through countless generations , perhaps it has lost its original meaning , and even become a controversial practice which smacks of abusing the bride .  
Formerly a planner for an advertising agency , Huang noticed many years ago that colorful and attractive magazine advertisements and calendar photos would serve as good basic material for creating original illustrations . TaKing great pains to gather these photos and art work that others saw as waste paper , he has cut them up and pasted them together into 150 collages that accompany the text .  
Now that attacking had become more of a challenge , the indigenous people organized 18 settlements together for a joint assault . The residents , fearing the aborigines would set the city wan alight , stacked up tens of oxcarts to build another wall outside the original one , and , after a fierce battle , finally pushed the attackers back into the hills .  
An American ceramic artist smashed a vase and treated each individual shard differently , then reassembled the vase into its original shape . Some visitors noticed a pile of white dust and wondered why it could not be blown away ; actually it was a work of art by a Japanese ceramics creator - - made from burnt aluminum ( the original ingredient of pottery ) .  
An expectations gapIn fact , there are some industries where economic conditions are not too bad , and people can find work in their original line . But sometimes , the needs of labor and capital collide . Therefore , despite the fact that there is a severe shortage of manufacturing labor , everywhere you can see laid-off industrial workers drifting to other areas of employment ; it 's very perplexing .  
The original content of the 24 Solar Terms was very simple , but over many years , they slowly developed into focal points for an extremely fertile cultural milieu . They are guides to farming life , reference dates for weather forecasting and holidays for all sorts of ceremonial activities . Almanacs , the weather , agriculture , the general life of the community - - all abide under the shadow of the Solar Terms !  
The game became popular in the Huangyen area of Zhejiang in the Taokuang reign ( 1821-1851 ) . The rules were as follows : First , the names of 34 famous people of old were written down . Then the game master would select one at random , and place it in a box . Then the players would bet which one it was , with the winner taking home 30 times the original wager .  
Now , through the efforts of several dedicated teachers at Shuanglung primary school , Shuanglung village has set up a Bunun Cultural Development Association , and has launched a series of back-to-roots events , such as leading tribespeople on visits to the Bunun 's original home , organizing a traditional " eight-part singing " group and opening a cultural resources office .  
The most marked characteristic of traditional Bunun garb is the pocket-like pouch worn at the chest by Bunun men , called a kulin . Men 's clothes feature colored patterns on a white background , with the main patterns being on the back , whereas women 's clothes are mainly black . According to custom , Bunun women can not wear brightly colored clothing because of their " original sin . "  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
According to the original recipe , the beef is first sliced and placed on top of the cooked noodles , then a superior stock made from chicken bones , medicinal herbs , shrimp sauce , fish sauce and so on is poured in ; lastly various raw vegetables such as chiutsengta and purple perilla are added , along with local herbs and leaves .  
They used a white glaze on which they painted decorative panels , or landscapes and pavilions , in blue enamel . Delft ware : the first Chinoiserie " The potters of that time made brilliant copies ; from a distance you ca n't tell them from original Chinese ware , " Mr . Koster observes as he guides us through Royal Delft 's exhibition rooms . Delft ware was a great success on the markets of the time , and later gradually moved away from imitating Ming blue-and-white ware , to develop its own distinctive style .  
Information from satellites was treated through the geographic information system ( commonly known as " electronic mapping " ) and then the extent of the completed golf course was compared to the original construction plan . It was thus confirmed that many operators brought their courses through a " metamorphosis , " encroaching on public lands and thus building far larger courses than authorized .  
Shen requested permission to build a city in Laochiao . Today 's Hengchun is laid out largely according to those plans . Materials about how the original town was built are described in detail in the National Palace Museum documents . Shen also came up with the policy of developing the mountains with separate northern , central and southern cross-island roads .  
Later on , the Puli Township public works bureau took the initiative to recruit scholars and relevant administrative agencies , holding the Puli High School Tamalin Ruins Investigative Conference , at which they decided a full-scale excavation ought to take place at the original test dig site . Up through the middle of April , the archaeological dig kept going .  
The 71-year-old Liu has many " firsts in Taiwan dance " to her credit . She was the first to earn a doctorate in dance ; the first to record aboriginal dance ; and the first to go abroad to copy original choreographic notation of ancient Chinese dance , which she then reconstructed and staged . Now in her sixth year since " retiring , " she is still teaching and choreographing non-stop .  
For Kuo Mei-fang , who had taken classes in Chinese architecture while in graduate school , had studied classical Chinese , and was familiar with ancient architectural drawings , reading Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao was not so difficult . By studying it again and again she came to appreciate the tremendous ingenuity of many aspects of Su Song 's original design , and solved many riddles ( see " How the Astronomical Clock Tower Worked " ) .  
Thus , perhaps we should take a more balanced attitude toward those scholars who were then so anxious to collect and preserve aboriginal culture , and who took every opportunity to introduce and promote the music across national boundaries . Otherwise , if everybody puts " self-interest " ahead of everything else in this dispute , this will definitely run counter to the original significance of the " Song of Joy " that has survived for so many years and that Difag made famous .  
This is of course sharing honor belonging to Sima Guang [ the original author ] , but I did make two contributions : ( 1 ) I made recondite classical Chinese understandable , and ( 2 ) I have given Chinese-or foreigners interested in uncovering the splendor of Chinese history-a chance to gain a complete familiarity by reading just one work . Nothing can substitute for it .  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
The landlord refused at first to accept the re-survey result , and hired a private firm of his own . The outcome was the same-his land was cut by about half . It is inferred that when using the triangulation method to measure the original lot , the workmen perhaps neglected to divide by two when calculating the area .  
Aside from the direct economic loss to the human race of the trees as a source of timber , many people believe that if large numbers of Taiwan red pine exit Taiwan 's biological stage , it would be overoptimistic to think that in many areas of rugged terrain where native pines now grow , the original vegetation could be restored by voluntary tree planting campaigns .  
In past times Ami songs had no set lyrics , but could be adapted to suit any occasion . Thus they expressed the original spontaneous creativity in Ami culture . Today , the songs of ' Api and his companions still serve to strengthen emotional bonds within the group , but they have also gained an ever clearer descriptive function , becoming " songs " with tunes and lyrics that are more and more fixed . In terms of both expression and creativity , they are growing more like modern songs .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
The mix of Chinese and barbarian was at first a matter of necessity . But since it has continually renewed and reproduced itself , with the efforts of each new generation , there has been a qualitative change . If individual cells in the primordial soup can come together to form a new organism , this organism is not just a mechanical combination of the original cells , but is an organic " creation . "  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
And , because the Three Kingdoms requires a knowledge of military tactics , it pushes players to study history more deeply outside the game . Tu 's son , a fifth grader , has carefully read a colloquial Chinese translation of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms ( the original is written in the difficult classical Chinese ) in order to better play the game , allowing his father to see the game 's charm firsthand .  
For instance , in the Four Pillars case , if the firm is found guilty , there will be criminal fines ( under the EEA , the maximum fine is US $ 5 million ) , as well as possible compensation in the civil suit . One can imagine a scenario in which all the profits for encroaching on intellectual rights over these past few years will enter the coffers of the American government and the original manufacturer , meaning that the efforts of the copying firms were all for other people 's gain .  
Taiwan composer Ma Shui-lung affirms Wong 's heartfelt efforts . But , purely from a musical point of view , he feels that the arrangements could be broader and deeper . Though it is great that popular tunes can be arranged to be more edifying without losing their common touch , it is also worth performing truly original works ; after all , the space for Chinese music is broad .  
" The places society leaves out in the cold are precisely the places a church hospital should bring its warmth to . " Chou Tien-hung says that because National Health Insurance payments for long-stay beds are rather low , most hospitals are unwilling to provide them , since they operate at a loss . Therefore the Mennonite Hospital planned to expand its original 300 beds to 500 , with the additional 200 beds all being long-stay beds ; the shortfall in finance for long-stay care would be covered by the operating surplus from the acute outpatients department .  
Some four years ago , when the architects responsible for renovating the Li Family Compound had the Lotus Flower Pool changed from its original irregular oval shape into the usual traditional half-moon shape , 77-year-old Li Yen Hsiu-feng , chairperson of the Li Family Compound management committee , insisted it be torn up and redone .  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
For example , traditionally most museums have had permanent collections built around a specific theme . But very often their artifacts are far removed from their places of origin , cutting off their connection to their original environment , thereby obscuring much of their contextual meaning .  
The simultaneous transfer of two high officials sparked a chain reaction of changes at the upper levels of the MOJ . The original cause was a political controversy sparked by an investigative report on allegations that Cheng had committed a sex crime . But the incident calls for broader thinking about issues that are becoming public as a result of democratization in Taiwan .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements . Hence the proportion of waste materials offered through the exchange center which are actually sold is very low-less than 10% .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
When Phase 2 of the project is completed ( expected to be in 2003 ) , the water will have risen by 135 meters . When the total project is finished ( est . 2009 ) , the water will be 175 meters-roughly equivalent to a 50-story building-above its original level . The resulting reservoir will be 300 kilometers across and the catchment area will cover 19 cities and counties including 300 smaller townships .  
From today 's perspective we see that although the government has maintained a continuous , unbroken hold on Taiwan , it long since underwent significant changes : from the tight control over the country in the early years , when the national leader was supreme , to the no-holds-barred democracy of today ; from a reverential attachment to Confucian orthodoxy and the complete rejection of any notion that the leadership could content itself with ruling just a small fragment of the original country , to today 's chaotic national identity .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
Says Mei : " This is where the Jesuits established the first Western-type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time here absorbing Western learning . " Macau emerged unscathed from WWII , and many of its original Portuguese-language documents have been preserved intact , providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .  
In making these works of art , one must use the exact same materials for the exterior and interior that would be used in making an actual architectural structure . The piano inside Rose Mansion is made of the same materials as a real piano , and the oil painting was carefully painted by an artist who made constant reference to the original painting . Even the trivets on the tabletops are made of real porcelain and stoneware !  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
Santa Claus and the department stores team up to hoodwink innocent , trusting little children , and the original religious meaning of Christmas has been replaced by a superficial " eat , drink , and be merry " approach to the holidays . This has happened because industrialized society is pulling away from its agrarian roots .  
On 24 March the Council of Grand Justices , which had been asked to examine the constitutionality of the assembly 's extension of its own term of office , ruled that the measure was invalid . Central Election Commission acting chairman Huang Shih-cheng has stated that if the Grand Justices ' ruling is confirmed , elections to the National Assembly will be held immediately , and can be expected to be completed before the assembly 's original mandate expires on 20 May .  
Moving further into the garden , you find a motorcyclist popping a wheelie across the lawn , a sprinter racing over the low hurdles , a high jumper doing the Fosbury flop , and other athletes doing stretches , gymnastic routines with hula hoops , etc . All these works are part of the Living World Series . Each life-sized athlete is made of painted bronze cast upon a mold formed from an original work made of tightly bound sponge .  
However , Columbia University professor and literary critic Wang Dewei feels that Gao Xingjian is a highly innovative writer with original ideas , and that a combination of factors including his fame overseas , his literary status , his creative style and his accessibility surely make him a fitting choice to receive the prize , whether on behalf of Chinese authors or of writers in exile .  
A : The original work itself is a highly ambitious novel , and a very successful one too . There is a sort of " sympathetic resonance " in this book between the uncertain social status of homosexuals and the uncertain international status of Taiwan itself . This resonance carries the significance of the novel to a higher level . Notes of a Desolate Man goes beyond mere description of the love lives of homosexuals .  
Although this incident is not related to the ongoing partisan conflict , it has generated an enormous stir in Taiwanese politics . The original political problem of unending discord has consequently become even more complex .  
The appeal of a divine being that loves all mankind did n't find a ready audience in Chinese who still had their original brush with the West-looking down the barrel of a gun-fresh in their memories ; people were suspicous of the relationship between Christian doctrine and economic interests ; and they got life-saving medicine side-by-side with life-destroying opium . People were not well educated and standards of living were low , so there was fear and prejudice against foreign culture .  
Director Stanley Kwan cut certain inflammatory portions of the original work , employing a plain narrative style to tell the story in a matter-of-fact way . In the absence of the exhibitionist language seen in earlier works of Kwan 's , Wen Tien-hsiang qualifies the final version as " accessible without being low-brow . "  
This goes far beyond Huang 's original expectations , for he was motivated solely by a love for the aesthetic sensibility of Victorian England , with the delicate beauty of its art , architecture , furniture , and decorative style . That is precisely what is lacking in Taiwan , where people have spent the last several decades pouring most of their energies into economic development .  
Italy 's " Slow Down the City " campaign was initiated by the mayor of a small Italian town . The campaign has also extended to the preservation of traditional vineyards threatened by multinational firms and industrialized farms , and restaurants have refused to accept " fast-food culture , " insisting on maintaining their original regional cuisines . Seventy Italian cities have already joined the campaign .  
" Hilltop Hunk , " adapted from a Japanese tune and performed by Hung Yi-feng , sold big in the 1960s . The record company took a shine to Hung and paired him up with Yeh Chun-lin to create a string of completely original works , thus bucking the trend at a time when songs adapted from Japanese tunes dominated . This development was a shot in the arm for the long-moribund market for natively produced Taiwanese pop . The new native tunes were featured in movies and spurred a third golden age in the Taiwanese genre .  
But this kind of standard is not entirely suitable for the wooden structures typical in Asian countries . For example , places like Japan 's Horyuji Temple must be extensively repaired every 20 years , even disassembled so that rotten lumber can be replaced . Fortunately , this can be done through systematically teaching traditional skills to successive generations and careful recording of the original work , so that these wooden historic sites can maintain a high level of quality and authenticity .  
The work has and will stand the test of time because of its clever design that utilizes the original splendid coloration ( a mixture of white and green ) and the remarkable carving that rendered a piece of jade into a life-like cabbage with two katydids on top of it . The work , however , also shows jade carvings ' traditional limitations .  
In the early days emphasis was placed on crops with high yields , short growing seasons , and resistance to diseases and pests . In recent years , in addition to the original functions , special emphasis has been placed on environmental protection , sustainable management , and improving the quality of life .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast . If such paper is exposed to ultraviolet light for a length of time , the color strength falls to less than half the original level . But the ciqing paper I make using indigo stays above 97% . "  
Theoretically , a rice wine unadulterated by ethanol should be more aromatic and tasty . But people still preferred the original formula . After this Daoxiang came on the market , it sold only about one million cases ( of one dozen bottles each ) per year , not even remotely close to the 17-million-plus cases of red label sold per annum . In 1999 , this all-rice version of Daoxiang made its bow and left the stage .  
Art critic Wang Chia-chi points out that Installation Art in Taiwan is basically written from the creative perspective of the artist , expressing both sympathy and empathy for the subject matter covered . As such , when Yao explains works , he strives to fathom the original creative intent of each artist . In consequence , the book has some commentary but is bereft of any clear , forceful critiques .  
As a liquid , lacquer must be spread onto some solid material . This solid material is called the base , and may be made of wood , bamboo , cloth , copper , paper , or other materials . In its original state the lacquer is highly viscous and must be thinned with camphor oil .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
From his welcoming of the Japanese into Taipei in 1895 to his contributions to the Japanese colonial government and to stabilizing social order , he continually maintained good relations with the colonial regime , in return for which he received monopoly privileges for camphor , edible salt , and opium . In addition , the Koos proved bold and adept at grasping trends , making investments , and diversifying their business interests , so that today , they are the only family of these original five to remain influential in industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan .
