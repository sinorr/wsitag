Delft ware was a great success on the markets of the time , and later gradually moved away from imitating Ming blue-and-white ware , to develop its own distinctive style .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election .

Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .

Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .

Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Many people were taken by their parents deep into the mountains to be tattooed in secret . The preconditions for having tattoos were gradually relaxed . Males no longer had to have hunted a human head , and females no longer had to be able to weave . The age at which facial tattooing occurred was also moved forward ; many children and adolescents had facial tattoos early , according to their parents ' wishes .  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people .

It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant .

When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move .

Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste . It also assumed responsibility for shipping the waste back to Taiwan , where it is now stored on a temporary site near Kaohsiung harbor . But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
Good times do n't last forever , and traditional opera was soon facing stiff competition from movies and television , while the glory days of the old venues faded out . Meanwhile the younger generation was becoming more westernized , and as multilingualism spread Fujianese opera could no longer rely on a captive audience of Minnan-only speakers . The times moved on , and with the launch in 1977 of the Singapore government 's Mandarin campaign , which included a ban on television programs in other Chinese dialects , the audience for Fujianese opera melted away .  
The political context has been democratized during the 50 years since the government moved to Taiwan , but much still needs to be done with regard to law and order . The economy may be flourishing , but in terms of environmental protection we completely fail to make the grade . Educational levels have jumped and society is buzzing with activity , yet some of the old qualities of generosity and forbearance have been sacrificed , and we are yet to attain the innate understanding and self-awareness of a mature society .  
And so she moved in a short time from perusing a few thin standardized teachers ' guides , to having a muddled understanding of Chinese grammar and history , to introducing China-that vast and distant land-to students who were even more ignorant of it than her . It was no easy feat .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
And what really moved him was not the magnificent , precipitous Huatung Valley , the endlessly rising peaks of Taroko Gorge , the serpentine curves of the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highways , or the year-round tropical greenery of Kenting-it was the rich cultural voice of Taiwan 's people .  
For example , people in the belt south of the Yangtze River generally eat " Ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from Guangdong and the Southern Fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip ( luobo ) and long-grain rice . As Lin writes : " Although my family moved around a lot when I was little , Mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every New Year to make luobo pudding for the whole family .  
In 1986 , Madame Chiang Kai-shek , who had already moved to America , came back to Taiwan to visit relatives . When I saw her graceful bearing as she left the airplane-saw how sharp and wise she was , and how bursting with vitality and determination-I realized that she was quite different from my earlier rendering of her .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
But in the months that followed the members of this team seemed to be marching to different drummers . They often contradicted each other , and their efforts seemed generally uncoordinated . A chorus of criticism rose up over the government 's handling of the Pachang Creek rescue incident , and criticism grew even more intense when the government moved to halt the construction of Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again . ( photo by Hsueh Chi-kuang )  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
From the 1950s , after the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan , Li served in such posts as chairman of the Industrial Development Commission , economic affairs minister and minister of finance , charting Taiwan 's economic , financial and technological development policies with bold vision . His emphasis on creating a favorable investment environment and cultivating new talent brought to Taiwan an unending flow of development projects , and earned him respect as Taiwan 's " Father of Technological Development " and " Architect of the Economic Miracle . "  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
But Hsin Tao , normally mild mannered and down-to-earth by nature , proved stubborn in this case . He tirelessly explained to the faithful that their contributions would be connected to the fate of mankind itself , and would be a manifestation of the great inclusive nature of Buddhism . People were moved by his sincerity , and gradually came to see what he envisioned , and thus committed themselves to carrying out their duties without looking back .  
With the ensuing civil war , Yu and his family moved to Taiwan , a country in extreme poverty and still relatively unenlightened . Yu decided to play out his role as intellectual and social critic through establishing a newspaper .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
Li Tung-liang , a director of the Chaoyang Lukang Association , points out that in the early years of the Guangxu reign period ( 1871-1908 ) of the Qing dynasty , the Quanzhou woodcarving master Li Ko-chiu moved to Lukang , where he gathered together all the local wood sculptors and organized a guild . Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , Taiwan underwent a complete economic restructuring and industry moved up another notch . Nowadays , the " knowledge economy " is vaunted above all else and biotechnology , nanotechnology , and advanced wafer technology rule the roost . In these high-tech workplaces most technical jobs are beyond the ability of current vocational senior high school graduates .  
" In addition to shaping and achieving goals , it 's also important to fill people 's bellies , " says Lee . He notes that after Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , local factories moved abroad and unemployment became a serious problem . Consequently , the community development program will only be judged a success if it is able to revive the community and resolve residents ' economic difficulties . With that in mind , the development of distinctive local industries has been an urgent concern .  
As human civilization has moved into the information age , factories , which had been designed with large-scale machinery in mind , have begun to shrink . Moreover , traditional factories , which used to be located in city centers , have been forced to move because of the pollution they cause or because the real estate value of land has come to outstrip its industrial value . This process has naturally left behind some major " industrial relics . "  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
Whenever Huang Shu-hui thinks of the many cold winter evenings her mother spent in the homes of other people , huddled in front of the fire , she is moved to tears . This motivated her to be successful whatever the cost , so that her mother would never again have to live such a hard life .  
Looking back over the financial history of Taiwan , when the Nationalist government first moved to Taiwan , it experienced hyperinflation and financial collapse , during which paper currency became worthless . Perhaps as a result of this harsh lesson , from the 1950s to the 1990s , the government maintained a very conservative posture , and its finances were continually in a healthy state .  
" In our more than ten years of service we have been deeply moved by the unfortunate situation created by international marriages . The harm and lasting effects on women and children is truly frightful and difficult to gauge accurately , " says Sister Therese Tang , executive director of the Good Shepherd Sisters Social Welfare Services Foundation . The government should set up an appropriate system of preventative measures , she says , but in the end , family problems must be solved by the families themselves .  
Furthermore , Taiwan cuisine went through a period of study , when it was absorbing the advantages of various Chinese regional cuisines , and it created a new kind of cuisine . This represents an even bigger revolution than the one that occurred after the southward migration during the Song dynasty , when the wealthy all moved to Hangzhou and developed " northern cooking with southern ingredients . "  
Because of US bombing raids during World War II , the Japanese instituted a policy of dispersal . When Chiu was six the whole family was moved to his maternal grandmother 's house in Tunghsiao Township , Miaoli County . American and Japanese planes would frequently engage in dogfights overhead , and each time the aerial battles finished , the local residents would go to the waterside in search of aluminum and plexiglas . The pieces of aluminum could be cut and trimmed into rice spatulas , and the plexiglas could be turned into toys .  
In 1915 , following the " Tafen Incident , " Aliman and his elder brother took to the hills to resist the Japanese authorities . Pursued by the Japanese police , the two fraternal heroes led fellow Bunun across peaks and precipices southwestward along the upper reaches of the Laonung River , finally reaching Yusui , hidden deep in harsh protective terrain . There they set up their base and carried on fighting against the Japanese police for more than a decade . Members of many different Aboriginal tribes , moved by their example , joined them .  
Besides conducting , Lee also mingled with the musicians , playing some percussion here and there . His obvious delight showed not in the least that this is a very ill man who has been long under medical care . Once absorbed in the music , Lee Tai-hsiang even moved to center stage and in a playful voice sang a medley of some of his songs that are by now familiar to everyone , such as " Sunlit Highway , " " A Beautiful Mistake , " and " Let Me Sing You One of Our Songs . "  
For instance , in his freshman year he easily won first prize in a violin competition . But the real reason he moved in the direction of music was probably that he had a crush on a female classmate of his , a girl with long flowing hair who also played violin well . Just to be near her , Lee transferred to the Department of Music , hoping he could win her over .  
Hu herself admits to having a very active disposition , and she ca n't stand being idle . Her free time at home was limited , and during the downtime after the housework was finished she was always a bit edgy and thinking about how she could further her learning , so she took on the volunteer work at the library . Later she joined up with a study group run by the Mandarin Daily News , and finally , ten years ago , she moved on to the volunteer service at NTUH .  
Lin Pen-hsuan , assistant professor at the Institute of Sociology at Nanhua University , reminds us that in this extremely commercialized world , people have moved from viewing the body as taboo , then opening up to an acceptance of it , to seeing that it can be manipulated and played around with . From beauty treatments and body sculpting to sexual promiscuity , the body is often packaged into a variety of discourses and commercial ends . Is there no escape from all of this , even in death ?  
In contemporary society , life and death have moved from being centered around the family to being handled by professionals , from being something human to becoming something mechanized . People have few opportunities to encounter birth or death , and to plumb the mysteries of life . On the one hand , this unfamiliarity with the basic processes of life frequently results in a nameless fear .  
As well as holding seminars and other such activities , the Educational Issues group also seeks to ' correct twisted educational values , ' " hoping to bring together the voices of concerned parents . After having held a public forum on this and come up with no obvious answers , they moved on to try tapping parent-teacher associations and study groups in an effort to establish a network and stake out a position in the community . Calling in the experts  
He was born in 1968 in Shanhua Township , Tainan County . In middle school he began to attend the local Holy Church , where Rev . Wang Tung-ho filled him with inspiration and guided his religious development . In his 30s , Wang had given up a bright future in the city and moved to the countryside to minister to the ordinary folk of the township .  
Seeing the industry on the decline hurt him deeply , and when he heard about the Cultural Association 's plan to try and revive it , he leapt straight in , despite not quite getting the idea himself . After reflecting on the current situation-all his children and grandchildren had moved elsewhere to work in other industries , so there would be no-one to carry on the tradition-he decided to devote himself to trying to help rebuild the old farms and give them a second shot at life .

The adoption of the draft resolution will affirm that the international community has actually derived benefit from the lessons of the recent past and is convinced that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure : had we moved at the right time within the ambit of preventive diplomacy , we could have prevented catastrophes such as those that have afflicted the Great Lakes region of Africa for about two years now , with Rwanda still suffering their scourge .

On 1 August 1996 , notwithstanding the repeated complaints by the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations and the many requests made to the authorities of the host country by citizens living in the vicinity of the Mission and by organizations representing various groups within American society to remove these provocative and offensive signs , the sign located on the north-east corner , inside the security area of the Permanent Mission of Cuba , was not taken down but simply moved to the north-west corner of the same intersection .

The reason why this issue remained unsolved for a long time is the existence of a separatist force inside Taiwan island , and the Taiwan authorities represented by Lee Teng-hui stubbornly adhered to a position of splitting up the motherland and moved farther and farther , thus causing a more and more severe situation across the straits .

Most of the major economic indicators broke out of the downward trend that had persisted for many years , with exports growing strongly , consumption expenditure rising , fixed assets investment having moved out of the trough , and all of the three major types of demand that drive the economy seeing growth .  
When Hong Kong moved into the final years of the transitional period , the last governor dispatched by the British side dished out a " three violation " political reform scheme , tried hard to foster their political proxy and extend the influence of their colonial rule , and attempted to create disorder and confusion to undermine the comprehensive implementation of the Basic Law in the future SAR .

Neither was registered under Lai Changxing 's name .  Another source also said : Lai Changxing moved to Hong Kong from mainland China some years ago and attained a Hong Kong resident 's identity card .  
During the " Ninth Five-Year Plan " period , we have faced challenges , eliminated difficulties , and moved forward with an enterprising spirit .  China has achieved a sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , resulting in further enhancement of its overall national strength , a " soft-landing " of its economy , and a success in curbing deflation .  
A number of cadres of central organs in Beijing , representatives of the people 's police of the capital 's public security system , and representatives of students at public security schools and academies listened to the reports on the advanced deeds of Comrade Liu Jinguo and were deeply moved .  They declared that they will learn from Comrade Liu Jinguo , exercise diligent government for the people , perform their duties in an honest and upright way , and be the people 's good servants .  
Economically , stock prices have fallen sharply , the real estate market is sluggish , many traditional industries have totally moved out of the island , and a financial storm is looming ahead .  The economy has continued to decline , and with the end of the year drawing near , enterprises are meeting with difficulties in settling their debts , while there is a sharp rise in the number of jobless people .  Because of this , the local people have no confidence in Taiwan 's future .  
This cult organization has moved against the historical current , is completely antagonistic to the scientific world , has tarnished human civilization , and has obstructed social progress .  These have determined its inevitable fate of a rapid destruction .  
To this end , Japan has changed its previous military deployment against the Soviet Union and comprehensively moved its main force to the west and southwest .  This year , it has also decided to establish an " island-protection force " to cope with the " activities of China 's naval vessels . "  Japan has even planned to equip itself with aircraft carriers in the next 15 years .

If their spouses have moved with the military units and have been registered residents for four years in Beijing , three years in Shanghai , or two years in Tianjin , Chongqing , a provincial or regional capital , or a city of a sub-provincial level or if their spouses are registered residents in any other cities , they may settle in that city .  
Those who fell under the spell of " Falungong " created the self-immolation incident in Tiananmen square , and this bloody lesson served to sound the alarm for society as a whole , particularly those practitioners who are still under the " Falungong " spell , with some people who have been under the spell of " Falungong " for a long time being deeply moved and shaken to their very souls , indicating their resolve to make a total break with the " Falungong " cult .  
As reform deepens , although government departments which have many years of planned economic traditions have improved the way the government operates in many aspects and unceasingly moved forward to a market economy , their behaviors still have the color of " examination and approval economy . "  The existing examination and approval system has increasingly not fitted in with the needs of socialist market economy .  
A cold front developed to the north of Hong Kong and moved south on May 24 bringing heavy showers and squally thunderstorms to local areas .  
For examples , he said , nowadays sea lanes were no longer dominated by traditional maritime powers , seafarers were more likely to come from Asia than Europe , trading patterns had changed , tankers and bulk carriers had grown to sizes that were unimaginable before , cargoes were moved by containers instead of carried in sacks and on pallets , the realisation of the need to tackle marine pollution and the drastic improvements in communications at sea .  
As the tropical depression moved away towards the west , fresh to strong easterlies set in on September 14 , bringing thundery showers in the early morning .  Showers eased off that afternoon and there were sunny periods .

"  
The people who inhabited South China from prehistoric times were the Nanyue people .  From the Qin and Han dynasties , the Han people of Central China migrated to the south , bringing with advanced culture and technology .  In the Tang and Song dynasties , the Pearl River Delta was developed and migrants multiplied in numbers .  In the Ming and Qing dynasties , more clans moved to Hong Kong and gave this small island a significant economic boost .  
The motion , to be moved by Hon CHAN yuen-han , says : " That , as the current economic and employment situations remain acute , and low-income earners and the poor elderly who are not receiving the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance are very hard up , this Council urges the Government to provide them with different forms of assistance or allowances in transport , medical , housing and education services , etc . , so as to improve the livelihood of these people and their families and relieve the pressure on them . "  
The motion , to be moved by Hon Frederick FUNG , says " That , as the Government will introduce very shortly a new charging scheme for public health care services and , in parallel , enhance the existing medical fee waiver mechanism , this Council urges the Government to relax the eligibility criteria under the mechanism so as to benefit more people from the socially disadvantaged groups , such as elderly persons , low-income earners and chronic patients .

"  
As more and more people have moved into new homes in urban high-rise buildings , they have inevitably missed the natural environment of the countryside . To overcome this sense of loss , many apartment dwellers have turned to artificial gardens , complete with trees , flowers , hills , pavilions , bridges , ponds and flower pots usually based on the style of the Chinese traditional garden .

Li-ho dedicated his first novel , entitled " The Oleander , " to his father , who died soon after it was completed . When Taiwan was recovered from the Japanese on V-J Day in 1946 , the Chungs moved back to Meinung in Taiwan , only to discover that his once wealthy family had fallen on hard times .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , a new administrative system was implemented which left Chang Hua without its provincial seat of government . The criteria for a provincial seat was either a population of half a million or a population of only 200,000 and a reputation as a cultural , economic or administrative center .  
The Republic of China has already passed the stage where its comparative advantage lies in a cheap labor supply , " says Wu Hui-lin of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " We 've moved into a period where technologically advanced and capital-intensive industries are more important . For mainland China in the short term to compete with us in the area of heavy industry would just be matching their weak point against our strongest . "  
Later the Taipei bookselling center moved to the Kuanghua Market , and Kulin Street dealers converted their stores into a downstairs part selling science and reference books and a cluttered upstairs featuring a wide array of stunning antiques . Many stores today on the third story of the Chunghua Market sell fine specimens of jade and pottery , and despite their small size and drab appearance , several boast an international reputation .  
Their feet moved to the upbeat rhythms of disco , rock , funk , and new wave music , their faces streaming with sweat under the brightly colored lights . They seemed to be burning with delight , wildly moving their bodies in a complete emotional release .  
The Taiwan Photographic Society , whose motto was realism with a local color , and the Photographic Society of China , whose rallying cry was salon pictorialism , represented the two main streams of photography on Taiwan during the 1960s and 70s . Because of differences in viewpoint , language , and thinking , the two groups moved in different circles of activity and engaged in different spheres of endeavor .  
Members of the Legislative Yuan : This year is the fortieth anniversary of the fall of the mainland . Many of us still recall that time just after the government moved to Taiwan , when aid from the international community had been cut off , when everything on the bastion of national recovery was waiting to be done , when the Communists across the strait clamored to " wash Taiwan in blood , " when the storm raged for a time , and the situation was precarious .  
We never thought we would buy a house in Hsichih , " says Hsiung Shu-hua , a public relations employee at Philips . She grew up in Hsichih but the place always seemed a bit of a backwater , awkward to get to and limited by its traditional rural economy , so when she got married three years ago she and her husband moved out to rented accommodation in Neihu .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , with people from the various provinces following close behind , the multifarious flavors of north and south China hit the ground running in Taiwan . Add to this the local native style , and you could say that this is the most fortuitous event in the history of Chinese food since somebody figured out how to make fire from rubbing sticks together in ancient times .  
Whether or not a program being planned to pass on traditional performing arts to the younger generation becomes a reality will depend on receiving a grant from the Council for Cultural Planning and Development . It 's worth noting that Yang Hsiu-ching and Yang Tzai-hsiung , a husband-and-wife team that has won a National Heritage Award for their achievements in Taiwanese shuo-ch'ang ( a form of popular entertainment featuring singing and comic dialogue ) and is considered a town treasure , have moved back to Hsichih after living elsewhere for many years .  
Art as Life : As dusk came over , sacred Tawu Mountain gradually was shrouded and disappeared . In a flash , Sakuliu had manufactured a durable firewall out of flagstones in the front room , and lit an enormous piece of wood using only half a sheet of newspaper , and then in one graceful gesture moved the now-cooled pot of water next to the fire to warm up .  
You can see new opportunities in a few phenomena of the early 1990s : The unreasonable explosion in real estate prices has left many empty offices with no one to rent them , as many investors have moved elsewhere because land prices are too expensive , so that recently there has been a softening in real estate . Also , Chinatown has internal forces for its own development : A league opposed to high land prices , with various clan and hometown friendship associations at the core , has appeared , hoping to force rents back down .  
Those days of Williamsport and the " Triple Crown " surely give us some warm memories : the whole family up in front of the TV in the wee hours of the morning to cheer on the team overseas , watching the children coming through the screen from the other side of the world winning the title " world champions " even as those in Taiwan were straining away to get the economy to take off and the country was meeting diplomatic setbacks in the 1970s - - what adult was n't moved to tears ?  
If earthworms could be raised in polluted soil , and then after a time moved out , even if the total amount of heavy metals in the environment was not changed , the land could be improved in this way , and the speed at which heavy metals are " passed on ' ' could be increased , thus lowering the recuperation time for the land .  
While studying at the World College of Journalism , he finally realized his desire to join a chorus and to get involved with music . After graduation , he went to work . Once he happened to see where the veteran lyricist Chen Tieh-yi was complaining that the lyrics of pop music were too commonplace and vulgar , and he felt moved to write a column in response .  
The tropical climate of heavy rains and high temperatures typical of the Indochina Peninsula is a natural hothouse for banana growing . Vietnam 's land , ten times larger than Taiwan 's , provides broad spaces to roam , and Pan Viet chairman C . F . Chang moved quickly to seize the investment opportunity .  
It 's just too bad that 12 years ago when the entire village moved down to the plains , their old village was left abandoned , its streets and gardens weed choked and its stone walls toppled .  
Although the Chinese communist authorities have already announced that they have arrested three suspects for robbing the passengers and burning the boat , the rigid attitude displayed by mainland China after the incident , their imperious obstruction of bereaved family members and reporters from Taiwan , and their sustained insistence that the incident was simply an accident , generated a strong reaction in Taiwan , where people moved to completely boycott cross-Strait exchanges .  
The initiator of illegal radio programs - - " People 's Radio " - - received a legal frequency one and a half years after they transmitted their first program without permission . They have moved from the underground out into the open air . Admits Ho Ma-li , chief of the " People 's Radio " program office , " Underground radio station programs are easier . "  
In the future , those indigenous people who may become journalists will probably come from an intellectual elite who have received a higher education in Han society . Their Sinicization will be quite thorough , and most will have long ago moved away from their ancestral homes . They wo n't necessarily understand the current problems in the aboriginal villages .  
As part of his surveys of the riverine ecology , he climbed through many gorges , discovering waterfalls constantly . In particular , beneath one crashing 18-meter-high waterfall near the Malien Stream , he felt indescribably moved and inspired . Once while walking along one the 12 main tributaries of the Malien Stream he found a forest of apricot trees in full bloom along 100 meters of the stream bank . The pink , dark red , and delicate white blossoms filled the air and danced in the breeze .  
They used a white glaze on which they painted decorative panels , or landscapes and pavilions , in blue enamel . Delft ware : the first Chinoiserie " The potters of that time made brilliant copies ; from a distance you ca n't tell them from original Chinese ware , " Mr . Koster observes as he guides us through Royal Delft 's exhibition rooms . Delft ware was a great success on the markets of the time , and later gradually moved away from imitating Ming blue-and-white ware , to develop its own distinctive style .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election . This figure was arrived at by starting with the number of people who " formerly had legal residence in Taiwan but then moved abroad , " minus the number of minors ( people below 20 ) and deceased persons . ( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Since 1993 , as part of a major government crackdown , the government has thus far closed down over 30 underground amphetamine laboratories . Nearly 14 tons of raw materials , finished products , and semi-finished products were uncovered . The industry 's history then repeated itself , only this time it was Taiwan drug manufacturers putting up the capital and providing the equipment and technology , as factories moved westward to coastal China ( especially Fujian ) . Goods produced there are either sold to Taiwanese businessmen or shipped out to Taiwan , Japan , and Korea .  
" In fact , Hong Kong 's intrinsic importance for Taiwan 's economy is not absolute . " C . J . Lee , director of the First Institute of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research , points out that Hong Kong 's own manufacturing industry has almost all moved north , and naturally Taiwanese companies will not choose to set up factories in Hong Kong . Hong Kong is not a production base , and there are no key raw materials or components which can only be obtained from the colony .  
However , although there is no concealing the negative effects of China 's growing influence over Hong Kong in the run-up to 1997 , the colony has also profited as China has reaped the rich benefits of its reform and liberalization program over the last ten years . Companies around the globe have moved from initial doubts and a wait-and-see attitude to gradual acceptance , and China has come to be widely seen as a place on which the hopes of the whole world for the manufacturing base and consumer market of the 21st century are focused .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
As the end approaches it is best if the patient can lie in the auspicious position with their head to the north and their face to the west , but this should not be forced , and after breathing stops they should be left to lie naturally , and not moved .  
In October last year it was reported that Taichung Station was to be moved underground , and that the old station building , which dates from the Japanese occupation era , might be demolished . The RCS joined with several other cultural and historical associations to put on a campaign to plead for the life of the 80-year-old station , including an event in which groups rode trains from both north and south to meet in Taichung . Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Many people were taken by their parents deep into the mountains to be tattooed in secret . The preconditions for having tattoos were gradually relaxed . Males no longer had to have hunted a human head , and females no longer had to be able to weave . The age at which facial tattooing occurred was also moved forward ; many children and adolescents had facial tattoos early , according to their parents ' wishes .  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people . They brought out the best of all they had for us , and looking at their honest and simple faces , while we were very moved , we also felt ashamed and uneasy , " says Ma . " Who were they ?  
Ho Chien-min , a thirty-year-old in direct sales who grew up in a Catholic family , says that he felt less and less able to identify with Catholicism as he grew older . He had n't been to church in more than 10 years , until a few years ago , when he heard the album of Catholic Gregorian chants , and was deeply moved . " It transcends the busy mundane world , raising the listener to a higher plane and drawing people to search for their spiritual source . "  
In 1973 , it was generally agreed that jurisdiction over the media should be unified in a single agency . So the Executive Yuan took publication industry affairs from the Ministry of the Interior , and film and broadcast affairs out of the Bureau of Education and Culture , and moved both to the GIO . The GIO doubled in size overnight , assuming its current structure of six departments and three divisions .  
Born and raised in Kaohsiung , Chen left his home for a decade , coming to Taipei to attend university and graduate school and to work . He moved back to Kaohsiung only in 1993 , and only then did he discover how much his old hometown had changed . To refamiliarize himself with the old stomping grounds , he signed up to be a guide with the Takao Hill Association . " The more I came to understand it , the more I treasured this piece of earth .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
Recently Taiwan prime-time variety shows , traditionally devoted to singing and silliness , have taken part in a new wave-telling " true life " stories with such themes as " searching for a long-lost loved one , " " repaying a benefactor , " " charity , " and " warmth . " Striking like a tear-gas canister , they not only set the people immediately involved weeping , they turn the usually light-hearted hosts red-eyed with emotion ; many audience members are likewise deeply moved .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
The object of traditional combat training was for war and self-defense . When military officers retired and moved back to their original homes , they brought their skills to a wider population , and thus martial arts began to spread . In the agricultural society of old , most people led plain lives , without time for such pursuits or the money to pay for training , which is why martial arts were generally passed down only in the families of the wealthy .  
FPG moved quickly to clarify the situation , and later stated that there had indeed been deficiencies in the selection of the company to which it had contracted disposal of the waste . It also assumed responsibility for shipping the waste back to Taiwan , where it is now stored on a temporary site near Kaohsiung harbor . But despite these actions , FPG 's image as a pragmatic and responsible company has been severely tarnished .  
Good times do n't last forever , and traditional opera was soon facing stiff competition from movies and television , while the glory days of the old venues faded out . Meanwhile the younger generation was becoming more westernized , and as multilingualism spread Fujianese opera could no longer rely on a captive audience of Minnan-only speakers . The times moved on , and with the launch in 1977 of the Singapore government 's Mandarin campaign , which included a ban on television programs in other Chinese dialects , the audience for Fujianese opera melted away .  
The political context has been democratized during the 50 years since the government moved to Taiwan , but much still needs to be done with regard to law and order . The economy may be flourishing , but in terms of environmental protection we completely fail to make the grade . Educational levels have jumped and society is buzzing with activity , yet some of the old qualities of generosity and forbearance have been sacrificed , and we are yet to attain the innate understanding and self-awareness of a mature society .  
And so she moved in a short time from perusing a few thin standardized teachers ' guides , to having a muddled understanding of Chinese grammar and history , to introducing China-that vast and distant land-to students who were even more ignorant of it than her . It was no easy feat .  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
And what really moved him was not the magnificent , precipitous Huatung Valley , the endlessly rising peaks of Taroko Gorge , the serpentine curves of the Central and Southern Cross-Island Highways , or the year-round tropical greenery of Kenting-it was the rich cultural voice of Taiwan 's people .  
For example , people in the belt south of the Yangtze River generally eat " Ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from Guangdong and the Southern Fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip ( luobo ) and long-grain rice . As Lin writes : " Although my family moved around a lot when I was little , Mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every New Year to make luobo pudding for the whole family .  
In 1986 , Madame Chiang Kai-shek , who had already moved to America , came back to Taiwan to visit relatives . When I saw her graceful bearing as she left the airplane-saw how sharp and wise she was , and how bursting with vitality and determination-I realized that she was quite different from my earlier rendering of her .  
The legal demobilization of the National Assembly was conducted without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government looks bleak . This dire outlook is surely not something Taiwan 's political parties expected when , attempting to align with public opinion , they moved to phase out the National Assembly .  
But in the months that followed the members of this team seemed to be marching to different drummers . They often contradicted each other , and their efforts seemed generally uncoordinated . A chorus of criticism rose up over the government 's handling of the Pachang Creek rescue incident , and criticism grew even more intense when the government moved to halt the construction of Taiwan 's fourth nuclear power plant .  
Plans for the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant have triggered an intense struggle between opponents of nuclear power and those more concerned about industrial development . A constitutional ruling by the Council of Grand Justices appears to have moved the debate back to square one , with the ruling and opposition parties slugging it out once again . ( photo by Hsueh Chi-kuang )  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Later , because strong winds and heavy seas made landing impossible , the camera team 's plans were delayed . The next time they were able to land on the islet where the birds were filmed , the Chinese crested terns had already moved on , so the team missed the opportunity to observe them more closely .  
" It 's been no easy task searching for a suitable place to live , and we eventually had to make the leap all the way from western Taiwan to Hualien here in the eastern part , " says Chang . They lived in Lukang before , but when that place started to become affected by industrial pollution , they moved to Meilun in Hualien , where they rented a house .  
From the 1950s , after the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan , Li served in such posts as chairman of the Industrial Development Commission , economic affairs minister and minister of finance , charting Taiwan 's economic , financial and technological development policies with bold vision . His emphasis on creating a favorable investment environment and cultivating new talent brought to Taiwan an unending flow of development projects , and earned him respect as Taiwan 's " Father of Technological Development " and " Architect of the Economic Miracle . "  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
But Hsin Tao , normally mild mannered and down-to-earth by nature , proved stubborn in this case . He tirelessly explained to the faithful that their contributions would be connected to the fate of mankind itself , and would be a manifestation of the great inclusive nature of Buddhism . People were moved by his sincerity , and gradually came to see what he envisioned , and thus committed themselves to carrying out their duties without looking back .  
With the ensuing civil war , Yu and his family moved to Taiwan , a country in extreme poverty and still relatively unenlightened . Yu decided to play out his role as intellectual and social critic through establishing a newspaper .  
At the end of the 1980s , when speculative fever was running rampant and the stock market was reaching all-time highs , Li intuitively understood that the Taiwanese economy was in for big change , so he sold his plumbing and electrical business to his brother . On the introduction of a friend , he , at the ripe old age of 53 , moved into an entirely new field , making instruments and gauges . He started with relatively simple water and electricity meters .  
Li Tung-liang , a director of the Chaoyang Lukang Association , points out that in the early years of the Guangxu reign period ( 1871-1908 ) of the Qing dynasty , the Quanzhou woodcarving master Li Ko-chiu moved to Lukang , where he gathered together all the local wood sculptors and organized a guild . Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .
