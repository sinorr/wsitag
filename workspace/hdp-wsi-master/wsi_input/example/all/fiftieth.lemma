The United Nations , which will commemorate its fiftieth anniversary , in a few days ' time , is now required to adapt to the realities of the age in order for it to be able to face up to the challenges of a world that is being torn apart by regional conflicts and whose progress towards prosperity is obstructed by very complex social and economic crises . 
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .

As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
Philip ( Solomon Islands ) : It is indeed fitting that this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly is being presided over by Mr . Freitas do Amara of Portugal , a distinguished teacher of law , an experienced parliamentarian , and the founder of one of the major political parties that helped to return vibrant democracy to his homeland .  
In this year in which we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , I would like to lay particular emphasis upon the extremely special nature of this regular contact , an exemplary expression of the close collaboration that should unite the principal organs of the United Nations as they strive to attain the purposes of the Organization .  
The celebration in a few days ' time of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will mark the Organization 's coming of age , and will also be an opportunity to lay the foundations for forms of international cooperation free from the ideological confrontation of the past , and directed firmly towards global challenges .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
President Monteiro ( spoke in Portuguese ; English text furnished by the delegation ) : First of all , Sir , I wish to tell you how pleased I am by your election to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly and , at the same time , I wish to express my firm belief that your well-known personal qualities and extensive experience will guarantee that you will lead the work of our Organization in an effective and decisive manner .

Our Government , headed by His Excellency Joaqu \ x { 74af } Balaguer , and the people that I represent join in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , and share the hope that the Organization 's efforts and successes will continue to increase in the continuing search for a just , united , common and fraternal humanity , sharing the material and spiritual assets of a civilization that can lead us to see people as part of a common humanity .  
My delegation believes that the fiftieth session should give serious consideration to the ways to work out the new approaches that are needed if the Organization is to go forward on solid and increasingly coherent bases in its search for viable and lasting solutions to problems of peace , security and development that pose a daily challenge to the international community . 
The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important in the historical development of the United Nations , not only because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional institution of universal scope , which was established to analyse , debate and seek solutions to problems of common concern to mankind , but also because current circumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the future of our Organization .  
Owada ( Japan ) : The fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , coming as it did in the midst of the structural changes that are taking place in the world in the wake of the end of the cold war , has offered us a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role of the United Nations in the contemporary international system .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
In this fiftieth anniversary year , the United Nations has reached a critical turning-point in appraising its past and in charting a viable course for its future , based on the renewed commitment , trust and consensus of its Member States . \ x { e51c } o save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .

Basing itself upon those principles and aspirations , Peru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes that the Organization should give serious thought to its future and to the course which international society is taking , so as to achieve a more complete vision encompassing different international realities based upon mutual respect and fairness among Member States .  
Habiyaremye ( Rwanda ) ( interpretation from French ) : This is not the first time that the Rwandese delegation has addressed this Assembly , over which Mr . Freitas do Amaral is so worthily presiding at this fiftieth session , on the subject of refugees , the restoration of peace , and Rwanda 's reconstruction and social and economic development after the unfortunate events of last year : war , genocide and massacres , as well as the resultant massive exodus of Rwandans . 
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In conclusion , Nigeria would like to see the First Committee at this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly motivated by the desire for cooperation in finding genuine and lasting solutions to those problems that continue to confront us in the area of disarmament in the remaining part of this twentieth century , in order to bequeath to the next generation in the twenty-first century a world which is indeed free of these weapons of mass destruction .

At its 93rd plenary meeting , on 20 December 1994 , the General Assembly decided to defer consideration of the agenda item entitled " Declaration of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity on the aerial and naval military attack against the Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by the present United States Administration in April 1986 " and to include it in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session .

The United Nations , which will commemorate its fiftieth anniversary , in a few days ' time , is now required to adapt to the realities of the age in order for it to be able to face up to the challenges of a world that is being torn apart by regional conflicts and whose progress towards prosperity is obstructed by very complex social and economic crises . 
The commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations affords an opportunity for giving deep thought to finding the best means of facing up to the challenges of our times and to equipping our Organization with the military capability and material resources that would enable it to address problems at the international level with a single standard based on the principles of equality and justice .  
It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
As the world 's leaders gather here later this month to reaffirm our collective commitment to our founding Charter , let our fiftieth anniversary celebration also signal a new start for our Organization , a new beginning in which we will address the challenges to global security and development with a fresh sense of equal responsibility and duty and with new structures in place to achieve our united goal of improving the world we live in for all our peoples .  
Philip ( Solomon Islands ) : It is indeed fitting that this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly is being presided over by Mr . Freitas do Amara of Portugal , a distinguished teacher of law , an experienced parliamentarian , and the founder of one of the major political parties that helped to return vibrant democracy to his homeland .  
In this year in which we are commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , I would like to lay particular emphasis upon the extremely special nature of this regular contact , an exemplary expression of the close collaboration that should unite the principal organs of the United Nations as they strive to attain the purposes of the Organization .  
The celebration in a few days ' time of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will mark the Organization 's coming of age , and will also be an opportunity to lay the foundations for forms of international cooperation free from the ideological confrontation of the past , and directed firmly towards global challenges .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
President Monteiro ( spoke in Portuguese ; English text furnished by the delegation ) : First of all , Sir , I wish to tell you how pleased I am by your election to the presidency of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly and , at the same time , I wish to express my firm belief that your well-known personal qualities and extensive experience will guarantee that you will lead the work of our Organization in an effective and decisive manner .

Our Government , headed by His Excellency Joaqu \ x { 74af } Balaguer , and the people that I represent join in celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , and share the hope that the Organization 's efforts and successes will continue to increase in the continuing search for a just , united , common and fraternal humanity , sharing the material and spiritual assets of a civilization that can lead us to see people as part of a common humanity .  
My delegation believes that the fiftieth session should give serious consideration to the ways to work out the new approaches that are needed if the Organization is to go forward on solid and increasingly coherent bases in its search for viable and lasting solutions to problems of peace , security and development that pose a daily challenge to the international community . 
The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important in the historical development of the United Nations , not only because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional institution of universal scope , which was established to analyse , debate and seek solutions to problems of common concern to mankind , but also because current circumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the future of our Organization .  
Owada ( Japan ) : The fiftieth anniversary of the creation of the United Nations , coming as it did in the midst of the structural changes that are taking place in the world in the wake of the end of the cold war , has offered us a golden opportunity for sober reflection upon the role of the United Nations in the contemporary international system .  
\ x { f734 } lem ( Turkey ) : As my Foreign Minister stated in the general debate earlier in the session , the fiftieth anniversary is the most opportune time to engage in self-criticism , to revisit the Charter of the United Nations , to get back to basics , to adapt the United Nations to the new political environment and to make it the real centre of collective security and global solidarity .  
In this fiftieth anniversary year , the United Nations has reached a critical turning-point in appraising its past and in charting a viable course for its future , based on the renewed commitment , trust and consensus of its Member States . \ x { e51c } o save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .

Basing itself upon those principles and aspirations , Peru welcomes the thinking that is taking place during this fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and believes that the Organization should give serious thought to its future and to the course which international society is taking , so as to achieve a more complete vision encompassing different international realities based upon mutual respect and fairness among Member States .  
Habiyaremye ( Rwanda ) ( interpretation from French ) : This is not the first time that the Rwandese delegation has addressed this Assembly , over which Mr . Freitas do Amaral is so worthily presiding at this fiftieth session , on the subject of refugees , the restoration of peace , and Rwanda 's reconstruction and social and economic development after the unfortunate events of last year : war , genocide and massacres , as well as the resultant massive exodus of Rwandans . 
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In conclusion , Nigeria would like to see the First Committee at this historic fiftieth session of the General Assembly motivated by the desire for cooperation in finding genuine and lasting solutions to those problems that continue to confront us in the area of disarmament in the remaining part of this twentieth century , in order to bequeath to the next generation in the twenty-first century a world which is indeed free of these weapons of mass destruction .

At its 93rd plenary meeting , on 20 December 1994 , the General Assembly decided to defer consideration of the agenda item entitled " Declaration of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity on the aerial and naval military attack against the Socialist People 's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya by the present United States Administration in April 1986 " and to include it in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session .
