For two decades , the joint commission has played an important role in increasing the mutual understanding of the two countries , promoting the mutually beneficial bilateral economic and trade cooperation , and maintaining and facilitating the stable and healthy development of the bilateral economic and trade relations .  
At the same time , during the " eighth five-year plan " period , the depth of opening to the outside world was unparalleled in history .  In the past , China 's opening has recently started to the outside world gave priority to commodity trade , introduction of technology , joint investment cooperatives , but it strives to scale high levels of introducing service , introducing operation methods of modern capital , etc . and has already begun to export capital overseas and even started participating in international financial operations .  
According to presentations , because foreign funded enterprises increased equipment imports as investments , and additionally , China , for the first time opened its foreign trade area to foreign capital in Pudong and established three joint venture trade companies , with imports and exports of foreign funded enterprises in Pudong this year increasing 37.4% compared with the same period last year , and reaching 3.86-billion US dollars while accounting for 45% of Pudong 's total imports and exports .  
The company has utilized and completely made liquid social assets of more than 10-billion yuan by employing forms such as mergers , acquisitions , etc . ; integrating its key development projects to attract overseas capital , FAW has successively established eighteen joint ventures with eight countries and regions .  
Among them , natural gas companies in Sichuan and Chongqi regions have respectively signed with US companies such as Texaco , Enron , Mobil , etc . for risk exploration contracts in the Ya'an and Leshan areas ; contracts for improving recovery ratios in the central north of Sichuan , and feasibility joint research agreements on natural gas up and downstream integrated projects in the area of Wenhuangduo in east Sichuan .  
Experts think that this rare and important astronomical phenomenon requires continuous global observation , and that China is located at an important longitudinal position between Japan and Europe , so , China 's observational material from is an indispensable and irreplaceable component in the international joint observation .  
In June 1995 , Li Teng-hui paid a visit to the United States in a so-called " private " capacity .  The Chinese Government launched a decisive anti-splittism and anti - " Taiwan independence " struggle and lodged a strong protest against the action of the US Government openly allowing Li Teng-hui to visit the United States , which violated the pledges made by the United States in the three Sino-US joint communiques and serious damaged China 's sovereignty , and solemnly and justly took up the matter with the US side .  
In line with the major central plans for launching antismuggling joint action and special struggles , they have exposed and handled a number of complicated cases which have caused very bad influences .  
The current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .  
It is also worth mentioning that the private companies under Chen ostensibly included some joint ventures with Hong Kong businesses , some joint ventures with banks , and also some joint ventures with the Yuhu Prefectural Government . As such , public ownership were intermixed with private ownership to give people many false impressions and make it difficult for people to discern their nature off-hand .  This was to make it easy for them to profit from confusion and to slip away unpunished in the event of an exposure of their offenses .  
Putin stressed that the Russian side would abide by the line of comprehensive cooperation between Russia and China and take into consideration bilateral cooperation in various fields in a balanced manner based on the various principles defined in the joint documents published by both sides and on the agreements reached by both sides .  
We should continue to improve the ownership structure where the public ownership plays a dominant role and various economic elements develop simultaneously and to develop nongovernmental scientific and technological enterprises , three types of joint ventures , and private and individual economic sectors , so as to make the economy of the capital full of vigor and vitality .  
In the automobile industry , a fairly solid foundation and strength have been built up for the production of motor cycles and medium-sized and light buses .  For sedan cars , since Guangzhou Honda , the main player in the field , is already a joint venture , the impact will not be as big as some people imagined .  The important thing is that it must be rapidly developed before the expirations of the protective period .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .  It is hoped that both sides will continue to make efforts and do effective work , thus continuously advancing bilateral friendship and cooperation and achieving more concrete cooperation results to bring benefits to both peoples .  
He stressed the need to conscientiously study and comprehensively understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's recent important speech on strengthening and improving the educational work , and implement his instructions in routine work .  School education , family education , and social education should be properly combined .  With the joint efforts of all parties concerned , a benign atmosphere for quality education should be created in society , and more favorable environment and conditions be created for youngsters ' healthy growth .  
A government-guiding strategy was gradually set up , and a situation in which leaders attached importance to tourism , all relevant departments make joint efforts , social participation was encouraged to jointly develop tourism on a large scale was created .  The market operational mechanisms in keeping with international practice was also set up on the whole .  In 1996 , the tourist industry successfully achieved , ahead of time , the foreign exchange earning goal set forth by Comrade Deng Xiaoping for the end of this century .  
It is hoped that leading cadres at all levels and comrades in the scientific and technological circles would further unify understanding , clearly identify their target , make joint efforts to promote the innovation of knowledge , and raise our basic research work to a new level in order to add brilliance to the world treasure-house of science and make greater contributions to China 's socialist modernization .  
However , we are principled on developing Sino-US relations ; that is , we should strictly abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations , especially the principle of mutual respect of each other 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and of mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
Just before the battle the training emphasized technical and tactical training for individual soldiers and small sections , and importance was also attached to coordination between different branches and joint training of major units ; at the same time the topography and weather conditions of the training areas were as far as possible similar to those of the target area .  
She even brazenly denied the common knowledge , universally recognized by the international community and known even to women and children , that Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times , and is still talking about seeking " substantive diplomacy " in the " joint rule of two sexes . "  Is she not asking the people of Taiwan to ride a horse blindfolded and approach the deep pond in the middle of the night ?  
With peaceful reunification , there will be reciprocal exchange , mutual cooperation , resources and market sharing , joint development and prosperity across the strait , but we do not want your money , nor collect taxes from you .  " Apart from letting you folks govern Taiwan , you can also take part in the management of China-wide affairs .  It is better than hiding in Taiwan with fear and trepidation , without any idea of the future , is it not ? "  
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1992 , bilateral relations have developed rapidly , and the two countries have engaged in very successful cooperation in many fields .  The Chinese side is very pleased with the development , but of the opinion that there is still great potential for the development of bilateral ties , and it takes joint efforts of both sides to continuously expand fields of mutually beneficial cooperation .  
At present , China 's civilian networks are widely distributed , and the web sites and net points are scattering everywhere .  To enable these scattered strengths to really form an integrated joint force for attack and defense during the war , we must establish a highly authoritative , centralized and united network people 's war organizational organ .  
The authorized sizes of our military academies are rather irrational .  It is necessary to make great efforts to enhance students ' scientific and cultural foundation as well as their ability in commanding and management .  We should run well the National Defense University , which aims at cultivating senior commanders who participate in the joint training program for officers of the three forces .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
and so on .  In their joint communique , the two sides have pledged to develop the national economy in a balanced way by virtue of economic cooperation and step up bilateral cooperation and exchanges in social , cultural , sports , public health , environmental , and some other areas .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
Moreover , the group army has also smoothed out and studied or tackled through its training exercises on the sea some difficult issues laid bare during several joint combat exercises held over the past few years , which have involved the units of various arms , including the group army itself .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
The gaining of all-round superiority in Joint Vision is drawn up in light of three changes .  First .  In the wake of the development of transport , telecommunications , and information technology , the trend of economic globalization has markedly speeded up , with the result that US interests and the international environment are closely linked , and this demands that the US military take military action in other regions of the world in joint ( combined ) form ;  
The main aim of Joint Vision in proposing " mutual compatibility " is focused on independent combat by the US military overseas or joint action with allied ( multinational ) units .  
Those completely agreeable views were mainly expressed in the joint communique issued by the representatives to the Japan-DPRK talks as follows : " 1 .  Both sides realized that both jointly agreed to improve Japan-DPRK ties .  In a spirit of enhancing mutual trust , both sides earnestly held discussions aimed at establishing good-neighborly and friendly ties at an early date .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
The long-standing logistics support pattern , under which the three armed forces had their individual systems and under which barriers existed between different departments and between different regions , was replaced by a joint logistics system , with military regions serving as a foundation .  As a result , logistics support has been put in place in a timely manner , supplies have never been suspended , none have ever been left out or under-supplied , and logistics resources have been reasonably distributed and effectively utilized .  
This can mainly be seen from the following aspects : First , more and more Taiwan businessmen have come to Zhejiang to make investments .  Starting the year 1987 which witnessed the first Taiwan investment in Zhejiang , the total accumulated number of Zhejiang-Taiwan joint ventures that Zhejiang has approved and established has exceeded 3,000 over the past dozen years ; and this has brought a total investment of $ 6.8 billion to our province , of which contractual investment amounts to some $ 5 billion while over $ 3-billion has been put to actual use .  
It is notable that while continuing to deepen bilateral military alliances with Japan , Australia , and the ROK , the United States is restoring and developing military ties with countries such as Thailand , the Philippines , Vietnam , and Singapore through a variety of military cooperation forms , such as gaining the right to use military facilities , agreements on military unit visits , joint military exercises , and so on , thereby markedly expanding its military presence in non-alliance countries and further increasing its military capability for intervening in Asia-Pacific affairs .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
In recent years , with the joint efforts made by compatriots on both sides of the strait , cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation have become close and closer .  The annual volume of trade between the two sides has exceeded $ 20-billion .  Every year , there is over 10-million tons of cargoes to be transported .  Realizing direct links in trade , transportation , and postal services across the Taiwan Strait has become an urgent need in the further development of cross-strait economic and trade relations .  
Starting in the late 1980 ' s and the early 1990 ' s , the US military has stepped up studies and practice in joint training , carried out exploration in the structure , content , order , rules , and means of joint training , and gradually formed a complete set of joint training structures with marked characteristics .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
It has also been laid down that the joint combat center is to provide theoretical , exercise , and technical guidance for combined operations training undertaken by the entire armed forces .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
Political military exercises are a new type of training which the US military has added in recent years ; these can be either joint or combined , and the main characteristic is that many departments take part in such exercises and the grades are high ; apart from the military , relevant academic institutions and government departments concerned also participate .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
To ensure that research work could be fulfilled on time , the brigade held a forum with local government and captains of some fishing boats to exchange views in a bid to improve the research findings .  They also formulated plans for a real army-civilian joint mine-sweeping drill , organized and completed a map inference for joint mine-sweeping operations .  
On the morning of the next day , the three minesweepers of the army-civilian joint mine-sweeping formation removed in succession all planted simulated mooring mines , untouched mines , and depth floating mines by means of cutting-type sweep gears , electromagnetic-sound sweep gears , and pulling the net .  The army-civilian joint mine sweeping drill achieved the scheduled effect .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in the meeting of the national united front work that , only by persisting in developing the most extensive patriotic united front led by our Party and uniting the entire Chinese people to make joint striving to materialize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people , can we be certain of success .  
The Consulate General of the People 's Republic of China Consulate in Chicago and the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , the largest independent , non-profit international affairs organization in the Midwest , recently held a joint reception at the Chinese consulate , which was attended by nearly one-hundred persons including members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , as well as persons from political , commercial , academic and media circles . 
In the course of repeated investigation , the joint investigation team organized by the CCDI and the State Administration of Taxation discovered through open investigation and covert visits that not only was the case highly complex but also that there were very big obstacles ; it involved certain Hong Kong businessmen as well as the principal leaders of Guangdong and Chaoshan .  
The enormous achievements accomplished during the " 9th Five-Year Plan " period are the result of the joint striving of the entire nation under circumstances whereby the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin was faced with numerous conflicts and difficulties and promptly established a series of proper policies and dispositions from its central command position .  
However , the imperfect laws and statutes concerned brought all kinds of problems and troubles to the actual process of introducing foreign capital into the country and restricted the development of the joint ventures .  The foreign businessmen gave a strong reaction .  
Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
In light of the numerous conjectures about China 's timetable on joining the WTO , Zhang said : China is ready to make joint efforts with the WTO members to finish the talks at an early date , but it is hard for the Chinese side to predict a specific timeframe for its accession because this does not depend on China alone but on the 140 WTO members , especially on the political desire of some developed countries . 
In order to provide market access opportunities for the undertaking of developing institutional investors on an usual scale and on the basis of strict self-discipline , the China Securities Regulatory Commission will adopt a series of measures including introduction of open-end fund , making preparations for and give approval to establishment of new fund companies , paying attention to relevant preparation work in terms of establishment of fund management companies of Chinese-foreign joint ventures , and conducting studies on proposals of innovation of various funding products which have been transformed from closed-end to open-end .  
To put it in concrete terms , first , we will institute a standard modern enterprise system , encouraging large and medium-sized SOEs to practice the joint-stock system , amplify the legal person management structure , and change their operational mechanism through such forms as standardized listing in the stock markets , joint ventures between Chinese and foreign investors , mutual share-holding , and so on . 
During the 1950s , along with a high-degree synthetic development from a unitary structure of the Army to a combined structure for all services and arms , including the Navy and the Air Force , and following its coordinated air-ground operations on the battlefield in Korea as well as its preliminary practice of a joint landing operations at Yijiangshan Island , our military started to put on its work schedule the theoretical study of coordinated operations involving all services and arms , and attained major achievements in this aspect .  
The US military , which was the first to advance and put into practice the idea of joint operations , was also once restricted by the thinking a " unitary service " ; yet through academic debates and the run-in of a series of war practices , a fairly complete system of principles and theories on joint operations has finally taken shape , and is now undergoing constant development .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
On 16 March , we saw " gunsmoke " rising inside an indoor campaign operation room of a certain group army in the Nanjing Military Region , for a joint operational training exercise was under way there , involving units of various services and arms : Commanding officers at all levels in several units of various services and arms were skillfully directing operations in accordance with a campaign resolve by coordinating and cooperating with one another in tacit agreement and by launching a fatal strike at an " enemy " with a " heavy fist " as well .  
This meeting fully affirmed the results of the special campaign at the previous stage against smuggling , foreign exchange evasion , illegal foreign exchange remittance , and deceptive acquisition of tax reimbursement for export , as well as the joint operation against the law-breaking and criminal activities of producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy commodities ; thoroughly analyzed the severity and harmfulness of existing market economic disorder and the major causes of these problems ; set the principal tasks of rectifying and regulating the market economic order in the next five years and the work focuses this year ;  
The " Plan and Program " points out that by the year 2010 , the whole Army will establish an integrated auditing system in keeping with the joint logistics guarantee system and equipment guarantee system .  The auditing duties and functions will be explicitly defined .  The supervisory mechanisms will be set to work effectively .  The auditing regulations will be improved according to the requirements of military economic reforms .  
- - All developing countries strengthen unity , make joint efforts toestablish a fair and reasonable international political and economic new order.Strive to advance democratization in international relations ;  
To resume the damaged bilateral ties , Kayato Ikeda , then prime minister of Japan , especially asked former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to pass a letter on to President Chiang Kai-shek , thus eventually renewing friendly relations between the two countries .  This was the diplomatic achievement made through the renowned " Yoshida letter . "  It will be clear in the next few days whether the US-China joint letter can match the " Yoshida letter . "  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
He reiterated that the development of Sino-US relations must be built on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms governing international relations such as mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
At the ceremony marking the publication of the first report from the forum " China and Her Neighbors , " a joint effort of the Wilton Park Conference , an independent British academic organization , and the Hong Kong Superior Resources Group , Wang Zhile pointed out that , faced with economic globalization , the developed nations and the developing nations alike should readjust the angles and ways in which they view the issue .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
Base leaders and official personnel will be deeply involved in on-site training , directing the troops in drawing up concrete training plans , scientifically arranging the contents of training , conducting strict inspections and supervising the organization and implementation of training .  They will participate in researching and attacking difficult key problems , comprehensively coordinating the relations among all the troops participating in the training , providing relevant assurances to the troops , and making a preliminary exploration of the use of large-scale training bases to organize joint training for different branches of the armed forces .  
A combination of operational forces has been accelerated further through the wide use of microelectronic and software technologies with computers at the core , remote and sense technologies dominated by battlefield monitoring and target detection , and military high-tech , such as military engineering , antichemical , and military command and management technologies .  Meanwhile , a new situation of joint operations , with coordination between frontline and rear units , among three armed forces , and between the military and civilians , has taken shape .  
In reality , logistics service forces are not merely limited to " hard " services , such as material supplies , public health services , repairs , transportation , and engineering , but they should also provide information and other " soft " services .  In this way , they are able to properly bring their joint logistics capabilities into full play at opportune moments and in proper places .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Most of the grass-roots units of this army unit are situated near the major center of the large-scale development of the western region , where the construction of some Sino-foreign joint venture projects have started with great momentum and to which tourists from afar , as well as Chinese and foreign reporters , are coming in a steady stream .  As a result , in the large-scale development of the western region , the unit has been subject to a grim test in terms of security work .  
We are willing to make joint efforts with Vietnamese comrades to develop better the relations between the two parties on the basis of independence , absolute equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in each other 's internal affairs ; smoothly promote the two countries ' traditional friendly cooperative relations to a higher level ; and blaze a more beautiful future for the two countries ' relations in the 21st century .  
China advocates strengthening the dialogue and communications between developed countries and developing countries .  Together they must work out a set of rules that are in the interests of all nations and will promote joint economic development and establish a new international economic order that is fair and equitable so that all countries will benefit tangibly from economic globalization and the push for an information economy .  
This reporter has learned from a news briefing held by the Supreme People 's Procuratorate in Chongqing today that since the Supreme People 's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security mapped out joint plans for a special operation on 18 January , initial success has been won in pursuing and arresting absconding suspects of embezzlement , bribery , and other crimes committed on duty .  So far , over 1,000 suspects have been arrested , including 270 who turned themselves in .  
has stepped up scientific and technological input in building a local network linking up its joint command center with its various county , township , and town bureaus for national defense mobilization purposes ; and has thus built a rapid mobilization system .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
7 .  Both sides confirm that they hold identical or similar views and stands on major international and regional issues at present and are willing to strengthen the two countries ' close cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations and make joint efforts toward establishing new international political and economic orders that are just and rational .  
Taking the " Pine Gap joint air defense research facility " electronic reconnaisance base as an example , this is located in a remote site in central Australia , well screened by trees , and equipped with large antennae ; it can receive signals from US satellites through infrared sensors , collect many signals from radar , radio , and telephone signals from Asia and the Middle East , and can also detect the great heat produced by ballistic missile launches in any place on the Eurasian land mass .  
Yang Jiechi pointed out : The US Government has disregarded repeated solemn representations made by the Chinese government , and made the above wrongful decision .  Their act has completely violated relevant stipulations of the three Sino-US joint communiques , in particular the stipulations of the " August 17 " communique , and constituted a serious infringement upon China 's sovereignty and wanton interference in China 's internal affairs .  The Chinese government and people have expressed strong indignation and firm opposition to the decision .  
Regardless of the strong protest of the Chinese Government , the US Government announced on 23 April its decision to sell Taiwan several billion US dollars ' worth of advanced weapons , including " Kidd-class " destroyers , diesel-power submarines , and P-3 anti-submarine patrol aircraft .  This move taken by the US government is a flagrant breach of the principles stated in the three Sino-US joint communiques that the US Government has repeatedly committed itself to ;  
Since the decision has violated the US commitment written in black and white in the three Sino-US joint communiques , especially that in the " 17 August " communique , and has wantonly interfered in China 's internal affairs and brazenly challenged China 's sovereignty , the Chinese Government has lodged a strong protest and made solemn representations to the US Government on the issue .  
Having studied some burning issues in the current international and regional situation , the foreign ministers confirm in the joint communiqu ? that they have the same position and pledge to jointly commit to the further reinforcement and continuous improvement of the cooperation among the " Shanghai Five " in international affairs .  
A certain division of the Guangzhou Military Region has strengthened the construction of communication networks to ensure an easy access of joint logistics command channels and the good quality and high efficiency of joint logistics services .  Through communication networks , this division has assigned annual service quotas and targets and transmitted information to more than 300 subordinate units in an exactly right way .  
We believe that , with joint efforts of both the military and the people throughout the country , the law on national defense education will be carried out and implemented in a comprehensive manner , and China 's national defense education project will advance in a healthy manner .  We believe that the sense of " all-people " national defense and the cohesion of the Chinese nation will further be strengthened , and the peace-loving Chinese nation will certainly create a stronger national defense .  
This exercise was held in order to further test and perfect the US-ROK " 5027 " provisional joint combat plan , enhance the joint command and coordinated combat capability of the two armies , and raise the rapid reaction capability of the US-ROK joint forces in dealing with a sudden incident .  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Since ours are modernized compound armed forces formed by various services and arms and supported by some space technology , if the commanders of our ground divisions have never seen a warship , a fighter plane , a campaign missile , or a tactical missile , and if the commanders of our naval and air units have never learned about the characteristics of a modern ground campaign , we will definitely lose the most basic knowledge support in cultivating such a concept as joint operations .  
Thus apart from laying a solid foundation of knowledge , especially by taking a " general course " on directing joint operations in a military academy or school , our commanding officers should also devote more energy to learning and applying knowledge on different services and arms through peacetime campaign training exercises ; should work hard to learn about the basic formations of different services and arms as well as the functional features and operational principles of different types of weapons and equipment ;  
The US , Japanese , and British forces have all stressed the following two requirements : First , a senior commanding officer shall have received training in various military academies and schools before taking office ; Second , a senior commanding officer shall have served in different posts in different services before taking office .  These two requirements have laid a foundation for a senior commanding officer to direct joint operations .  
He stressed : We highly value the development of Sino-US ties .  We propose : Sino-US ties should be dealt with from a strategic and long-term perspective , and the differences between the two countries handled in a proper way .  China and the United States should maintain and develop healthy and stable bilateral ties based on the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the norms governing international ties so as to benefit the people of the two countries .  
She called on various localities and departments to put into effect the guidelines of the National Work Meeting on Rectifying and Standardizing Market Economic Order conscientiously , further stress the key points , put the responsibility system into practice , and continue to carry out in a thoroughgoing way the joint action to severely crack down on the lawbreaking criminal activities of making and selling fake and shoddy products , so as to vigorously push forward the work of rectifying and standardizing market economic order .  
The joint action to crack down on fake products has effectively protected consumers ' interest and maintained market economic order , hence , it was welcome by the broad masses and the enterprises at home and abroad .  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
Since China and Nepal established diplomatic relations in 1955 , the relations of friendly cooperation have developed in a sustained , healthy and stable manner thanks to the close attention and meticulous care of the leaders of the two countries as well as the joint efforts made by the two peoples .  
The Chinese side expounded the principled stand on the current bilateral relations and on the Taiwan issue , and stressed : China is willing to develop healthy and stable relations with the United States ; the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations should be abided by .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
Article 2 : These guiding opinions are applicable to those joint stock limited companies that were formed in accordance with the " Company Law " and are planning to make an initial public offering of shares ( hereinafter referred to as " companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market " ) within the People 's Republic of China .  
Article 17 : Other enterprises that are looking to incorporate companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market shall form joint stock limited companies in compliance with the relevant provisions in the " Company Law " and in accordance with the requirements for standardized restructuring and complete reorganization , or they shall incorporate as joint stock limited companies by undergoing a complete transformation .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
The Central Military Commission recently decided to select middle - and high-ranking cadres working in one branch of the military to receive training given by a military academy under another branch of the military .  This created a new training model that will certainly be an important driving force in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations in modern - - and particularly high-tech - - wars .  
Even though in the case of a joint combat battlefield centering around ground forces the traditional one-dimensional support model for covering the entire in-depth battlefield may still ensure combat needs , with the unprecedented rapid development of multidimensional space in the joint combat battlefields of the future , only through the comprehensive utilization of a variety of support methods in multidimensional space will it be possible to ensure the demand of combat operations for logistical support .  
What stable supply and maintenance support links refers to is the integrated use of various support means , with pre-combat support deployment serving as the base , to form a multidimensional logistical support network for the entire in-depth joint combat battlefield , including supply and support links in which the replenishment of ammunition is a key point , technical support links in which the maintenance of new and high-tech equipment is a key point , and knowledge support links in which troops with special skills are the key points .  
It is not hard to discover that the idea running through these specific items is that , in organizing logistical support for joint combat , information sharing is the foundation , the optimal deployment of support resources is the goal , and technical cooperation is the key .  
The massive utilization of high-tech equipment has established a firm material foundation for joint combat , and at the same time it is giving an increasingly stronger intellectual and knowledge orientation to logistical support .  The contradiction between the lack of enough skilled specialists and the growing quantities of new and high-tech equipment will become more pronounced .  
The US Government has ignored China 's solemn representations on many occasions and is bent on allowing Chen Shui-bian to " transit through " the United States . This has violated the three joint communiques between China and the United States and relevant commitments made by the United States , encouraged the swollen arrogance of the " Taiwan independence " forces , and wantonly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  
The European Parliament highly values the correct position adopted by China in the Asian financial crisis a few years ago , and is glad to see that China has made great achievements in its socialist modernization and in maintaining social stability , and enabling its people to live and work happily and peacefully .  It is willing to make joint efforts with the Chinese side in strengthening cooperation in the political , economic , trade , and financial fields , and make greater efforts to advance the comprehensive development of European-Chinese relations .  
Sino-US ties will move along a normal track so long as both sides abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and such basic norms governing international ties on mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , and noninterference in each other 's internal affairs .  
Shan Jie has also spared no effort to mobilize the local masses to collect and purchase Wulingzhi , Yizhihao , Hongjingtian , and other natural medicinal herbs which grow on the plateau , and has set up Tibet Kangda Medicines Company Ltd . as the first " joint venture enterprise on the plateau . "  As a result , the county 's annual financial revenue has risen by 6 million yuan .  
The Russian navy will make no major adjustment of its setup .  In the future the Russian navy will gradually increase joint naval exercises , organize mobile groups of a temporary nature , and dispatch special mixed formations to important sea areas so as to restore the past gallant appearance of the navy .  
Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides , significant progress has been made in our bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties , and excellent results have been achieved in mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres .  We are happy to see that China 's NPC and the National Assembly of the ROK have also established and maintained friendly ties .  
To continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system nationwide , it involves large areas and arduous tasks ; under the unified leadership of party committees and governments at corresponding levels and with the vigorous support and supervision of people 's congresses and local committees of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , various regions should persist in integrating themselves with relevant departments , take coordinated action , and bring the enthusiasm of localities , industries , and departments into full play in order to form a joint force in work .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
The Russian military has actively organized joint air defense exercises and anti-terrorist exercises with countries of the CIS , held military conferences with the CIS , enforced joint air defenses , and helped concerned countries restore radar early warning systems .  The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
During the meeting , senior officials agreed unanimously that under the current circumstances where the economic development in the region is faced with uncertain factors , member economies of APEC should make joint efforts in continuously sticking to the progress of trade and investment liberalization .  
To this end , India has designed a series of diplomatic steps : In 1996 , India for the first time joined the Regional Forum of ASEAN and in 2000 , its defense minister paid a visit to Japan and the two countries conducted a joint military exercise in the South China Sea , which has laid a foundation for India to be militarily involved in the South China Sea and signified that India has stridden over the second door in the process of " eastward expansion " .  
It is worth pondering that after this multinational joint exercise , this naval task fleet of India did not leave the region , but on the contrary continued to stay there .  Moreover , it was joined by one more " Kilo " class submarine and several antisubmarine patrol aircrafts to continue their unilateral naval exercise .  
Since last year , Japan and India have constantly strengthened their cooperation in military and other fields , established a partnership relationship , conducted many joint military exercises , jointly cracked down on those pirates threatening Japan 's energy passage at sea , and weakened the strategic pressures brought about by China to Japan at sea . 
If in trying to understand joint operations , we failed to recognize the temporal background and essential characteristics of their birth and development or failed to recognize the essential distinction between informationized warfare and mechanized warfare , it would tie our understanding down to the level of concerted and combined operations .  Consequently , the commanding ideology would lag behind the times .  
In our research and explorations , we should be mindful of avoiding and overcoming research methods that are isolated and focus on separate points only , be mindful of avoiding and overcoming the conventional thinking that looks at only a single , specific object , and observe and analyze issues from multiple dimensions and angles , so that our research takes on more characteristics of the times and that the theory and practice of joint operations can better cater to the development of the times .  
Your distinguished nation has pursued a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping initiative in one 's own hands , has protected world peace and promoted joint progress , and has played an increasingly important role in international and regional affairs .  
With the joint efforts of the cadres and masses , this traditional major wheat - and cotton-producing county has presented a gratifying situation in which multiple industries including wheat , cotton , fruits , Chinese medicinal herbs , vegetables , flowers , and processing of agricultural products are developed simultaneously .  
A joint command will have to concentrate both qualified and capable command personnel and technologically advanced command facilities .  On the basis of guaranteeing efficient operation , a joint command will have to set up fewer vertical command links , and recruit fewer but highly capable personnel , aside from constantly studying new command measures , and raising command efficiency , thus ensuring timely , highly efficient , and acute command , and unleashing overall operational efficiency to the greatest extent , in a key zone , and at a crucial juncture .  
As joint operations waged under modern conditions involve a large number of precision-guided weapons , intelligent weapons , as well as the C4ISR system , which serves as " nerves and brains " for different weapons systems and military command systems , concentration of military strength is now increasingly dependent upon a commander 's enormous potential unleashed via an information system , and upon a perfect integration of different weapons systems and information systems .  
Given this , and as proven by a series of recent local wars , in joint operations , aside from concentrating " capability " for a strike aimed at destroying the enemy 's " hardware " , such as personnel and arms , a belligerent will also have to concentrate superior forces and lethal weapons for a strike at the enemy 's weapons systems , information systems , logistic support systems , and especially at their vital and vulnerable points , in order to paralyze the enemy 's vital systems . 
As an old saying goes , " the strength of a tree can be tested by strong winds , and real gold can be distinguished with fire " .  Over the past 50 years , with the profound care of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the people of the two countries , the across-the-board friendship between the two countries withstood various tests , and was firmly maintained and continuously developed , becoming a model of friendly coexistence of countries with different social systems .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
The " Shanghai Five " mechanism advocates good neighborly relations , mutual trust , equality , mutual benefits , unity , cooperation , and joint development .  It has provided the international community with valuable experience and inspiration in abandoning the Cold War mentality and in actively exploring for a new type of state-to-state relations , a new type of security view , and a new type of regional cooperation model in the post-Cold War era , and has made positive contributions to world peace and stability .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
It was revealed that the Nationalist forces have already listed a series of missile development programs in the Academia Sinica 's secret budget for projects like " special missile national defense technology " and " joint air defense and counteroffensive , " and such missile development programs include : Hsiungfeng III supersonic anti-ship missiles , which are being developed under " The Hsiungping Program , " and are scheduled for a control test on their initial versions later this year ;  
In the new period of reform , opening up , and modernization , the party established and developed the patriotic united front , extensively united Chinese people at home and abroad , in the course of consistently carrying out the basic line of " one center , two basic points " , to make joint efforts for deepening reforms , expanding opening-up , speeding up development , safeguarding stability , promoting the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao , and promoting the development of cross-strait relations .  Great achievements attracting worldwide attention were achieved in this regard .  
In accordance with the overall plans for stopping the source and blocking the flow of drugs , public security and anti-narcotics departments as well as border defense , customs control , railroad , communications , civil aviation and other related departments in Yunnan , Guangxi and Guizhou in China 's southwestern region have further improved their investigation networks as well as their comprehensive multi-force joint operations , thus effectively cutting off the frantic infiltration of drugs into our country .  
Over the past few years , thanks to the joint efforts exerted by the entire party and the whole society , the essential aspect of the style of thinking and moral qualities of the whole society is active , healthy and progressive .  Gratifying changes have taken place in the mental outlook of our people .  
The responsible comrades of the Party committees and governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , members of the for the joint conference on the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas , and others respectively attended the teleconference at branch meeting places in localities concerned .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
He then pointed out that the potential for expansion of economic relations between Belarus and China is far from being fully developed .  Measures must continue to be taken , and a new scope of cooperation and new projects must be identified .  The current pattern of pure trade must transform into more modern , more advanced methods of cooperation , such as joint research , development , and production of high-tech products .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
In recent years , the base 's relevant departments have repeatedly organized rapid mobilization of maritime medical teams from its hospital and urgently dispatched them for training in sea rescue , with some of them participating in the highly difficult joint ship-airplane rescue drills .  
China and Russia will further strengthen strategic cooperation , together advance the world multipolarization process and the building of a democratic , fair , and rational new economic order , and work together to preserve world peace and promote joint development , This is the objective requirement of the current development of the international situation and is also the unshirkable major responsibility of the two countries .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out : Over the years , the journalistic circles across the strait have given scope to their irreplaceable positive role in improving mutual understanding and communication between the people across the strait .  Thanks to their joint efforts , the development of news exchanges across the strait has not been easy to come by and has to be jointly cherished and maintained by both sides of the strait .  
The communique says , the two leaders affirm that their stances on a whole series of major international issues are identical or similar ; both advocate strengthening their coordination and close cooperation within the framework of the United Nations and other international organizations , and will make joint efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order .  
We are willing to continue to strengthen cooperation in the international arena and make joint efforts to promote the establishment of a democratic , fair and rational new international political and economic order and to create a new world of lasting peace and universal prosperity .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
To prove that all this is not non-existent , the US Department of Defense recently also announced that it would provide Taiwan a " joint tactical information transmission system " worth $ 725-million and transform Taiwan 's " joint operation command center of the three armed services " and the operation command centers of various types of units , so that the United States and Taiwan could be linked through identical operation command systems .  
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations . "  
For several days running , fishermen braved the sweltering heat and the choppy water alongside the unit 's officers and men .  Together they assembled , laid low waiting for the right opportunity , set off rapidly , and launched joint attacks , thereby honing their skills in carrying out joint attack , defense , and rescue operations at sea .  
In order to ensure harbor safety and a smooth navigation channel during wartime , the unit made full use of local fishing vessels in their preparations for military struggles and regarded conducting joint military-civilian sea drills to " launch counterattacks on small-scale enemies " an important study subject .  After repeated deliberations and verifications , the unit drew up a plan to build a combined formation of corvettes and armed fishing vessels and lay down the principle for allocating men and equipment .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
Increasingly , Xinjiang 's ethnic separatist forces abroad have tended to join forces in launching attacks , replacing scattered operations with regional operations , and even with transregional , transnational , multi-level , and joint operations , and such an initial tendency may be viewed at the following three levels : 
On 9 May , the State Council held the second video and telephone conference on nationally coordinated operation to crack down on the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities and made arrangements for the nationwide joint operation against the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities , focusing on food , medicines , agricultural supplies , cotton , and illegally assembled automobiles using cannibalized parts .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
Logistics support must be adapted to such circumstances in order to meet the need of frequent level changes in a joint operation .  This calls for a system in which the organs are streamlined , levels reduced , functions clearly defined , and relationship smooth so as to realize an integral operation from strategic logistics to tactical logistics .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
Not long ago , ChinaNet launched a formidable offensive in Chongqing , Hangzhou , and Shandong 's Zibo , either by forming a joint venture with a local government-run operation or by forging an alliance with a local radio , movie , and television operation in order to bring lasting pressure to bear on China Telecom in the telecommunications field , especially in the future broadband business .  
In 1998 . a delegation led by Comrade Luo Gan attended the 20th special United National Assembly on narcotics control , putting forward a three-point proposal of " adhering to the principle of extensive participation and joint responsibility , implementing a comprehensive and balanced international narcotics-control strategy in an all-round way , and paying attention to substitution and development , " which received close attention and favorable comments by various countries .  
According to the plan of the China Power Company , in the next 15 years , China will lay stress on developing hydropower plants in the western region .  The goal is to realize " sending electric power from the west to the east " and establish a national joint power supply network .  
In 2015 , with the completion of major hydroelectric power bases and backbone power stations , all regional power networks will be linked to form a unified national joint power supply network .  The goal of " transmitting electric power from the western region to the eastern region " will be reached .  China can basically change the situation of shortage of electric power in the eastern region and thus further promote economic development .  
China and the United States have had reciprocal visits by their respective leaders , and have achieved a common understanding on numerous issues of common concern .  Furthermore , the " joint Sino-U.S . statement " issued by the two countries pointed out that " as powers in the Asian-Pacific region , China and the United States wish to enhance their cooperation and deal jointly with the various challenges that are faced in order to make a positive contribution to the promotion of stability and prosperity in the region . "  
The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation . "  
In the article Wang Hui pointed out that despite an unusual development in cross-strait relations , trade between the two sides of the strait continued to set an all-time record in 1999 and the contracted Taiwan investment amount still posted more than 10-percent point increase , thanks to the joint efforts of the business and industrial circles of the two sides of the strait .  The growth of the mainland exports to Taiwan , however , was down and the actual Taiwan investment amount continued to slide .  
Observers are convinced that the extensive common understanding reached by leaders of the two countries in their meetings and the joint communique signed by leaders of the two countries constitute a telling blow to Xinjiang 's separatist force in Turkey . Meanwhile , such common understanding has removed obstacles in the full development of relations between the two countries in the new century .

In the sixth area of education , health and sports , the two sides agreed to encourage the exchange of talent and experience in order to promote quality education and strengthen bilateral ties .  As regards the health sector , the two sides will enhance co-operation in the areas of academic exchange and Chinese medicinal products development , as well as encouraging Hong Kong investment in Shanghai 's medical institutions in the form of joint ventures .  As for sports , both sides would step up collaboration on the development of sports industries .  
Based on the conditions of product distribution , geographic environment and market demands , special production areas were established to grow pineapples , bananas , oranges , grapes , and other fruits for export .

A joint venture of six private chemical firms , the plant was completed in May 1973 , with a total capitalization of NT $ 320 million ( US $ 8 million ) . Equipped with ultramodern machinery , it was designed to produce Vinyl Chloride Monomer ( VCM ) for use by the local plastics industry . Because of climate and technical problems , however , the machinery did not work satisfactorily , and by 1975 , operations were halted except for four or five months a year .  
September and October are the best months to enjoy crab , as the meat is then both succulent and plump . One way to test the quality of a crab is to pinch the upper leg joint ; if it is firm and hard then there will be a lot of meat inside .  
It seems that Yue Loong has proven that the ROC can design a fine automotile itself . In its cooperative work with Ford , Taiwan 's Ford Lio Ho Motor Company earned first place among Ford 's worldwide joint venture operations , winning thereby the chance to build a car for export to Canada .  
Since September 1984 , when the joint declaration was announced , the ships have continued to ply the harbor as busily as before ; the young people and Westerners continue to crowd the shopping district , with its windows full of tempting goods from around the world ; and the sound of mahjong continues to rise and fall from the upstairs tearooms . . . on the surface , nothing seems to have changed .  
It so happened that the project coincided with the Ministry of Communication 's hunt for a new deepwater port facility , and a joint outline was drawn up which envisioned a reclaimed land area of 6,700 hectares , and investment of some 400 billion NT dollars . The blueprint for eventual use of the dry land area is still undergoing approval at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
Exercise : The Stepping Stone to Rehabilitation : Taking sufferers from infantile paralysis as an example , Wu says that if no rehabilitation treatment is administered , lower limbs are too weak to support the body and normal walking is impossible . Excessive joint friction , ineffectual muscles , and numbness are common consequences , resulting in " second-degree disability . " Some cerebral palsy victims sometimes reach the point where their entire bodies need rehabilitative treatment , Wu explains .  
Much as he loves traditional outdoor theater , he is planning appropriate ways to educate audiences intheater-going : by setting up a circus tent , for instance , and charging a fee for refreshments , so that audiences will treat the theater as something more special than they had in the past . At the same time that he is busy forming the new company , Yu continues to engage in field work , searching for veteran artists and arranging for joint performances and master classes .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
The domestic environmental protection industry still is quite a bit behind international standards , and the gap is unbridgeable in incinerator beds and in prevention of air pollution from emissions . Thus this set of domestic bidding restrictions includes a proviso : The domestic firm that wins the bid must cooperate with an original manufacturer from the United States or Europe to import the technology and undertake joint responsibility for the projects .  
Relatively speaking , Mr . Chang 's modus operandi was very open and generous . He liked cast-of-thousands films that required large investments . Ms . Tung , on the other hand , was more restrained and prudent , and she paid attention to the efficiency of the expenditures , " points out Chen You-hsin , an old-time marquee attraction who often took part in Hsinhua productions . As a result , under their joint direction , Hsinhua had just the right functional balance of boldness and reserve .  
In this situation the government decided to set up a special project , enlisting the ITRI 's Mechanical Industry Research Laboratories to bring in American technology for combined research and development . When the development was finished , hands were joined again with the private sector to establish a compressor factory , with joint production and distribution free of Japanese control .  
Now that attacking had become more of a challenge , the indigenous people organized 18 settlements together for a joint assault . The residents , fearing the aborigines would set the city wan alight , stacked up tens of oxcarts to build another wall outside the original one , and , after a fierce battle , finally pushed the attackers back into the hills .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
In order to gain market share , UMC has not only built a third factory , which was finished just last year , but has also set up joint ventures with 11 foreign companies to simultaneously build three eight-inch wafer plants in the Hsinchu Science Park ; the plants are to do contract work for these companies . With shareholdings of 25% in the three new joint-venture companies acquired with cash investments and another 15% for technical input , UMC will also have operating control of them .  
The ERSO , which single-handedly created the ROC 's semiconductor industry 16 years ago , has been the ROC 's biggest source of qualified staff in the field , and it successfully set up three of the industry 's companies : UMC , TSMC and Vanguard . But most private-sector companies do not have such a solid research team , and if they wish to join the fray , they have no choice but to directly form joint ventures with foreign companies , or buy technology from abroad .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Its methodology is based upon today 's Voluntary High School Admissions Program , which adopts a five-level grade scoring system . ( This program , implemented in an experimental phase in 1990 , allows participating junior high students to advance to high school based on written application forms and school grades , rather than performance on the joint entrance exam . )  
In the blueprint drawn up by the Ministry of Education , because vocational high schools will be exam-free , students below 18 years of age will experience the opportunity to make an independent choice . Whether they want to go to high school and then to university , or to go the way of vocational education , their direction will be determined in advance , so the number of candidates sitting for the university joint entrance examination will probably be smaller than it is today .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Take for example illegal entry into the exclusive maritime economic zone to catch fish . Last May , the Taiwanese ship Tung Heng # 3 , which is supposed to operate only in the high seas , was painted red to give it the false appearance of a joint venture ship , and entered into the economic zone .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
In fact , the various statements made by PRC officials at APEC were unsurprising . What was unexpected and regrettable was the lopsided bias toward mainland China displayed by New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon . At a joint ministerial press conference , he prevented ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang from speaking , while allowing PRC officials to answer in his place , and he prevented Taiwan reporters from speaking on several occasions .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
In contrasting multiple-track admissions to the joint entrance exam , he says , " The joint exam was like a general ledger : only the final figure counted , so that eventual success could wipe clean earlier failures . But the problem was that children just had one way to succeed . What 's worth applauding about multiple-track admissions is that it lets children with different sets of strengths all have a chance to get ahead . "  
At a time when multi-track admissions have yet to meet with widespread support among parents and teachers , an unfortunate incident occurred at the end of February . It was discovered that students at about a dozen junior high schools had been leaked the answers to the mock joint exams . This led to fears that the multiple track admissions policy was not as fair as the joint entrance exam .  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
The gifted students were assigned to normal classes , and it was only for math that they came together for a special class . Yet their math teacher felt that they still needed to go deeper and cover more ground . The math covered at school simply was n't enough , so they all enrolled in supplementary " cram school " classes as well . Mrs . Liu realized that the joint entrance exam questions got easier every year and that thus the essay might be the section that would determine her daughter 's fate .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
At the same time , he has worked all his life in his capacity as an individual artist to promote contemporary Taiwanese art both at home and abroad . To this end , he has organized countless solo and joint exhibits , talked his good friend and printmaker Chu Wei-pai into opening an art gallery , introduced to Taiwan 's art community the works of such expatriate painters as Charng Yuh and Chao Wu-chi , and done many other things to inject renewed life into Taiwan 's arts scene .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
Chang Chao-tang was born to a family of doctors in Panchiao , Taipei County . A smart kid , he was granted admission to Taipei 's prestigious Cheng Kung Senior High School based on his outstanding academic record alone , so that he did n't need to take the joint entrance exam .

Though coordination has been enhanced and joint initiatives have multiplied , much still needs to be done to develop a comprehensive network of systematic relationships that will exploit the potential of this United Nations programme and its professional contributions in key areas . 
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .

Since the moment last November when you , Sir , were kind enough to entrust me with the coordination of these consultations , we have held a total of 36 full days of meetings , in addition to many informal consultations , or hallway meetings in many cases coordinated by specific delegations that generously devoted their time and efforts to act as facilitators as well as countless individual contacts and joint internal discussions within the various groups .

The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Our signature of the Convention and the subsequently active role we took in the joint endeavour to craft it into workable mechanisms reflect in general Israel 's vision of the world in which it wishes to exist and prosper _ in particular its continuing interest , which is shared by many other countries , to preserve the Convention 's core balance between a State 's duty to demonstrate compliance and its right to protect itself from intrusive and abusive encroachment on its security and its commercial and proprietary interests .  
In view of the above-mentioned points , my Government considers paragraph 1 of the joint statement signed by the Presidents of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan relating to " the delimitation of administrative and territorial borders along a line running through the middle of the Sea " as a step in violation of the existing legal regime and declares that it bears no legal value and shall not affect , directly or indirectly , the existing legal regime and any future agreement that may be concluded among the five coastal States .

In addition to close inter-agency ties , reciprocal attendance on official occasions and cooperation on a variety of technical activities , seminars and meetings , a particularly significant feature of UNESCO and SELA cooperation is that it has included not only regional , subregional and other international organizations , but also agents from civil society , such as the members of the communication media , in their joint action , thereby making it an important promoter and catalyst in the service of development in Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Given the very rapid technological change and short product life cycles associated with the global competitive environment , this joint technological development activity can be encouraged by incentives , government subsidies and general public support .  
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
A considerable contribution to strengthening security in the Mediterranean could be made by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe , which has accumulated sound experience in drawing up and implementing joint steps by participating countries to strengthen security and cooperation in the military-political , economic , humanitarian and other spheres that could also be drawn on for resolving Mediterranean problems .

Despite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of members of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past few years to contain the devastating effects of the conflicts in the Arab Gulf region , which has great importance to regional and international strategies , and their continuing endeavour to support progress towards joint reconstruction and cooperation , the unstable political and security conditions in the region remain a source of concern for us .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .

Through our Madrid joint statement , by which we stand , it has been put to our neighbour to respect the existing overall framework of international law and treaties that has defined our borders and relations and has stood unchallenged for the last 70 years , and to desist from aggressive policies , refrain from territorial claims and submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice any argument it might deem valid concerning the islet of Imia .  
The very fact that the most diametrically opposed positions have used contradictory numerical estimates makes us think that these calculations could change if applied one by one to all the separate paragraphs and subparagraphs of the groups or clusters that a joint decision would contain that is , on the questions of permanent members , non-permanent members , rotation , discrimination , the veto , procedural matters , working methods and so forth . 
During the past three years we have made extraordinary progress in our integration efforts , which extend from a new conceptual horizon , one that has become better balanced and more inclusive with the creation of the Alliance for Sustainable Development and the establishment of innovative regional projects to increase regional competitiveness by means of joint efforts on the part of Governments , academic centres and sectors of production . 
Those who are familiar with Central American history and aware of our current efforts in the various fields of integration know that Central American union is not simply an act of faith ; it is , rather , a work of engineering , an enormous undertaking that , taking into account the unique qualities of each of our States , is the key to the exercise of joint sovereignty .  
The parties agreed on a list of priority sites and a preliminary timetable for the clearing of unburied mortal remains , and established a joint expert commission consisting of two forensic pathologists from each party , with the task of implementing the agreed _ upon inter-party exhumations .

As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
Agenda 21 has proved to be the starting point for many new business initiatives with sustainability as their stated objective , with notable progress in the areas of joint industry / government partnerships and the development of innovative policy instruments , environmentally efficient technologies and products , and broader sustainability concerns regarding the relation of business and the wider community .

The memorandum of understanding has paved the way for increased levels of cooperation , including discussion of possible joint missions to assess and address the needs of separated minors and other groups identified as particularly vulnerable and the establishment of common standards and practices .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
The Government has also set in motion the Social Solidarity Network , a strategy that aims at improving the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and initiating large social programmes through joint efforts of State-owned and territorial institutions , non-governmental organizations and the civil society .  
Furthermore , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee during its meeting held in March 1997 , recognized the need to put in place a simple joint monitoring system for humanitarian assistance programmes that would ensure accountability , transparency , optimum utilization of resources , avoid potential duplication efforts , and adjust to changing situations , issues which have not fully been addressed in humanitarian programmes to date .  
The highest aim in their common belief is the human dimension of this joint initiative , which , as a continuing process , through comprehensive cooperation , should provide rapid economic development and prosperity to the peoples of the region .

Rather , it rests with the selfish and unilateral policies of the controlling Powers , whose interests can not be served by using the United Nations mechanisms established for the correct application of the principles and rules of the Charter , which reflect the joint will and collective interests of the members of the international community . 
Regardless of what the Charter provides in terms of rights , duties and procedures , we are convinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that affects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in favour of the general international interest , as evidenced by the records of this Organization .  
We are confident that the adoption of draft resolution A 54 L . 12 , just introduced by the Ambassador of Burkina Faso , will serve as another basis for promoting in the coming year joint activities which fall within the common purposes of both organizations , whose goals are to ensure international cooperation in seeking solutions to international economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems .

Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .

Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
They should make joint efforts in running schools and in tackling key technical problems .  We should enable military schools gear toward the world by gradually expanding their exchanges and cooperation with their foreign counterparts .  We should make bold efforts in learning and borrowing advanced ideas and useful experiences from foreign military academies by exchanging students and conducting scientific research cooperation with them .  
On the basis that an all level network will gradually become familiar with office , strategic , and technical exercises , we should strengthen the joint communications connections of the information networks of all military branches , taking the theater level as the base unit .  In particular we should pay attention to applying computer network technology and satellite technology , gradually expanding the three branches joint network training avenues by forming into one entity the training among combat , support , and logistics systems among the various military branches .  
Through reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , clearly explaining the common interest relations and our trans-century development objectives , plans , and policies among the masses though propaganda and inculcation , we shall make the 1.2-billion people share the same ideological base , hold the same ideal and belief , and strive for the same goal .  Thus , greater enthusiasm , initiative , and creativity will burst forth among our people in their joint struggle for building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
After the new technologies and new methods of operation produced through the academy and troops ' joint effort in tackling key problems were popularized and applied in the various relevant units , the scientific and technological content of army training have greatly increased .  As a result , troop training through science and technology , in which the troops under training strike extreme low-altitude , high-speed targets with air defense missiles , has gotten over its " bottleneck " and is developing in the direction of high quality and greater depth .  
Operations under high-tech conditions are the combined operations of all the military branches ; and in adapting correspondingly , equipment support can only be planned overall after going through the three branches ' joint support , and only then will there be a rational distribution of resources , organizational chaos be overcome , waste of materials and equipment be overcome , work procedures be simplified , and non-support consumption be lessened , fully putting into play the capability of existing resources .  
In line with a civilian market having abundant technology and products that are suited to the requirements of military equipment , many civilian-use technologies such as electronics technology , information technology , production technology , and materials technologies , all of which have developed rapidly , our army has instituted several " joint logistics reforms " and logistics reforms with " socialized support " as the main content , thus decreasing the burden and lengthening the strides forward .  
By holding a real-soldier training exercise on a real site and democratically pooling the wisdom of the masses , they developed a set of concrete tactics , such as " launching an attack by simultaneously pulling out the heart and eyes ; launching a joint attack by removing the skin tissue by tissue ; and laying an ambush by leaving a false way out , " thus enabling their light armored vehicles to fight with an iron fist and defend themselves like a fortress .  
and so on .  In their joint communique , the two sides have pledged to develop the national economy in a balanced way by virtue of economic cooperation and step up bilateral cooperation and exchanges in social , cultural , sports , public health , environmental , and some other areas .  
To coordinate all quarters concerned means to properly coordinate the work relationship of the municipal people 's congress standing committee , and the municipal government , and the municipal committee of the CPPCC according to the requirements for advancing the work across the board , and properly coordinate and arrange the work for the organizational , propaganda , united front , and judicial departments so that all of them can properly perform their functions , fulfill their duties , cooperate , and form a joint force .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
Moreover , the group army has also smoothed out and studied or tackled through its training exercises on the sea some difficult issues laid bare during several joint combat exercises held over the past few years , which have involved the units of various arms , including the group army itself .  
Global interests and responsibilities are the theoretical textbook carefully cooked up by the United States in order to pursue global hegemony , build a geopolitical framework with the Eurasian continent as the main body , and achieve its unipolar strategic goal .  Guided by this strategic goal , the new vision emphasizes joint or combined operations when taking military action , in order to maintain military superiority and create a favorable environment for the United States ;  
The gaining of all-round superiority in Joint Vision is drawn up in light of three changes .  First .  In the wake of the development of transport , telecommunications , and information technology , the trend of economic globalization has markedly speeded up , with the result that US interests and the international environment are closely linked , and this demands that the US military take military action in other regions of the world in joint ( combined ) form ;  
The main aim of Joint Vision in proposing " mutual compatibility " is focused on independent combat by the US military overseas or joint action with allied ( multinational ) units .  
Those completely agreeable views were mainly expressed in the joint communique issued by the representatives to the Japan-DPRK talks as follows : " 1 .  Both sides realized that both jointly agreed to improve Japan-DPRK ties .  In a spirit of enhancing mutual trust , both sides earnestly held discussions aimed at establishing good-neighborly and friendly ties at an early date .  
Japanese-US joint military exercises have seen great changes in content , form and scale in recent years .  Their advance combat planning has been perfected and their combat capability and level of coordination have been further improved .  The trend of the two sides joining forces in military intervention in the security affairs of the Asia-Pacific region and in the handling of the surrounding situation is becoming more obvious , and this is bound to become a new destabilizing factor in security of the Asia-Pacific region .  
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core and through the joint efforts of the people of all nationalities of the whole country , the main tasks put forth in the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan will be accomplished on time , national economic and social developments have attained great achievements , the second-step strategic objective for the socialist modernization construction has been comprehensively realized , and the social productive forces have entered a new stage .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
With series of new characteristics , such as modern joint campaigns , accelerated tempo of operational progress , large consumption of equipment materials , hyperspace , real time , diversified targets , highly efficient means , and intensive management of resources , mobile support tasks will be more arduous .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
The long-standing logistics support pattern , under which the three armed forces had their individual systems and under which barriers existed between different departments and between different regions , was replaced by a joint logistics system , with military regions serving as a foundation .  As a result , logistics support has been put in place in a timely manner , supplies have never been suspended , none have ever been left out or under-supplied , and logistics resources have been reasonably distributed and effectively utilized .  
This can mainly be seen from the following aspects : First , more and more Taiwan businessmen have come to Zhejiang to make investments .  Starting the year 1987 which witnessed the first Taiwan investment in Zhejiang , the total accumulated number of Zhejiang-Taiwan joint ventures that Zhejiang has approved and established has exceeded 3,000 over the past dozen years ; and this has brought a total investment of $ 6.8 billion to our province , of which contractual investment amounts to some $ 5 billion while over $ 3-billion has been put to actual use .  
It is notable that while continuing to deepen bilateral military alliances with Japan , Australia , and the ROK , the United States is restoring and developing military ties with countries such as Thailand , the Philippines , Vietnam , and Singapore through a variety of military cooperation forms , such as gaining the right to use military facilities , agreements on military unit visits , joint military exercises , and so on , thereby markedly expanding its military presence in non-alliance countries and further increasing its military capability for intervening in Asia-Pacific affairs .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
The leaders of these five countries signed the Dushanbe Declaration proclaiming their joint opposition to ethnic separatism , international terrorism , and religious extremism , and reached a major consensus on building an edifice of neighborly , friendly , and peaceful cooperation that is oriented toward the 21st century .  
In recent years , with the joint efforts made by compatriots on both sides of the strait , cross-strait economic exchanges and cooperation have become close and closer .  The annual volume of trade between the two sides has exceeded $ 20-billion .  Every year , there is over 10-million tons of cargoes to be transported .  Realizing direct links in trade , transportation , and postal services across the Taiwan Strait has become an urgent need in the further development of cross-strait economic and trade relations .  
Starting in the late 1980 ' s and the early 1990 ' s , the US military has stepped up studies and practice in joint training , carried out exploration in the structure , content , order , rules , and means of joint training , and gradually formed a complete set of joint training structures with marked characteristics .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
It has also been laid down that the joint combat center is to provide theoretical , exercise , and technical guidance for combined operations training undertaken by the entire armed forces .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
Political military exercises are a new type of training which the US military has added in recent years ; these can be either joint or combined , and the main characteristic is that many departments take part in such exercises and the grades are high ; apart from the military , relevant academic institutions and government departments concerned also participate .  
For this reason , the US military has assigned the units concerned the task of carrying out extensive legislative investigation and studies and of setting to work to implement the issues that need defining in the leadership structure , theoretical setup , and the relevant rules and regulations involved in joint training , and will continue to produce a series of regulatory documents to ensure that joint training proceeds in a regular and orderly way .  
should firmly grasp and successfully conduct training of units of various services or arms in a coordinated way , in such a background as launching joint operations , and by firmly focusing on the needs of a military struggle in the future ; should step up research and training by integrating firepower warfare with information warfare ; should make redoubled efforts to explore coordinated combat command methods or fighting methods in a complicated electromagnetic environment ;  
To ensure that research work could be fulfilled on time , the brigade held a forum with local government and captains of some fishing boats to exchange views in a bid to improve the research findings .  They also formulated plans for a real army-civilian joint mine-sweeping drill , organized and completed a map inference for joint mine-sweeping operations .  
On the morning of the next day , the three minesweepers of the army-civilian joint mine-sweeping formation removed in succession all planted simulated mooring mines , untouched mines , and depth floating mines by means of cutting-type sweep gears , electromagnetic-sound sweep gears , and pulling the net .  The army-civilian joint mine sweeping drill achieved the scheduled effect .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out in the meeting of the national united front work that , only by persisting in developing the most extensive patriotic united front led by our Party and uniting the entire Chinese people to make joint striving to materialize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people , can we be certain of success .  
The Consulate General of the People 's Republic of China Consulate in Chicago and the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , the largest independent , non-profit international affairs organization in the Midwest , recently held a joint reception at the Chinese consulate , which was attended by nearly one-hundred persons including members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the Chicago Counsel on Foreign Relations , as well as persons from political , commercial , academic and media circles . 
In the course of repeated investigation , the joint investigation team organized by the CCDI and the State Administration of Taxation discovered through open investigation and covert visits that not only was the case highly complex but also that there were very big obstacles ; it involved certain Hong Kong businessmen as well as the principal leaders of Guangdong and Chaoshan .  
The enormous achievements accomplished during the " 9th Five-Year Plan " period are the result of the joint striving of the entire nation under circumstances whereby the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin was faced with numerous conflicts and difficulties and promptly established a series of proper policies and dispositions from its central command position .  
However , the imperfect laws and statutes concerned brought all kinds of problems and troubles to the actual process of introducing foreign capital into the country and restricted the development of the joint ventures .  The foreign businessmen gave a strong reaction .  
Judging from the present condition , for a considerably long time to come , Sino-foreign joint ventures will still be our principal method to attract foreign direct investments .  There is no doubt that improving the relevant legal systems , freeing such enterprises from unwarranted control and making things easy for them , and eliminating the negative impact of legal factors on the investment environment will greatly enhance the confidence and enthusiasm of overseas investors and quasi-investors and touch off another round of investment high tide .  
In light of the numerous conjectures about China 's timetable on joining the WTO , Zhang said : China is ready to make joint efforts with the WTO members to finish the talks at an early date , but it is hard for the Chinese side to predict a specific timeframe for its accession because this does not depend on China alone but on the 140 WTO members , especially on the political desire of some developed countries . 
In order to provide market access opportunities for the undertaking of developing institutional investors on an usual scale and on the basis of strict self-discipline , the China Securities Regulatory Commission will adopt a series of measures including introduction of open-end fund , making preparations for and give approval to establishment of new fund companies , paying attention to relevant preparation work in terms of establishment of fund management companies of Chinese-foreign joint ventures , and conducting studies on proposals of innovation of various funding products which have been transformed from closed-end to open-end .  
To put it in concrete terms , first , we will institute a standard modern enterprise system , encouraging large and medium-sized SOEs to practice the joint-stock system , amplify the legal person management structure , and change their operational mechanism through such forms as standardized listing in the stock markets , joint ventures between Chinese and foreign investors , mutual share-holding , and so on . 
During the 1950s , along with a high-degree synthetic development from a unitary structure of the Army to a combined structure for all services and arms , including the Navy and the Air Force , and following its coordinated air-ground operations on the battlefield in Korea as well as its preliminary practice of a joint landing operations at Yijiangshan Island , our military started to put on its work schedule the theoretical study of coordinated operations involving all services and arms , and attained major achievements in this aspect .  
The US military , which was the first to advance and put into practice the idea of joint operations , was also once restricted by the thinking a " unitary service " ; yet through academic debates and the run-in of a series of war practices , a fairly complete system of principles and theories on joint operations has finally taken shape , and is now undergoing constant development .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
The US military believes that , based on its technical superiority , in future joint operations they " will be able to achieve decisive superiority through asymmetric actions using the power of joint forces to strike at the enemy 's weak points and the skillful use of troops in terms of time and space . "  
On 16 March , we saw " gunsmoke " rising inside an indoor campaign operation room of a certain group army in the Nanjing Military Region , for a joint operational training exercise was under way there , involving units of various services and arms : Commanding officers at all levels in several units of various services and arms were skillfully directing operations in accordance with a campaign resolve by coordinating and cooperating with one another in tacit agreement and by launching a fatal strike at an " enemy " with a " heavy fist " as well .  
This meeting fully affirmed the results of the special campaign at the previous stage against smuggling , foreign exchange evasion , illegal foreign exchange remittance , and deceptive acquisition of tax reimbursement for export , as well as the joint operation against the law-breaking and criminal activities of producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy commodities ; thoroughly analyzed the severity and harmfulness of existing market economic disorder and the major causes of these problems ; set the principal tasks of rectifying and regulating the market economic order in the next five years and the work focuses this year ;  
The " Plan and Program " points out that by the year 2010 , the whole Army will establish an integrated auditing system in keeping with the joint logistics guarantee system and equipment guarantee system .  The auditing duties and functions will be explicitly defined .  The supervisory mechanisms will be set to work effectively .  The auditing regulations will be improved according to the requirements of military economic reforms .  
- - All developing countries strengthen unity , make joint efforts toestablish a fair and reasonable international political and economic new order.Strive to advance democratization in international relations ;  
To resume the damaged bilateral ties , Kayato Ikeda , then prime minister of Japan , especially asked former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to pass a letter on to President Chiang Kai-shek , thus eventually renewing friendly relations between the two countries .  This was the diplomatic achievement made through the renowned " Yoshida letter . "  It will be clear in the next few days whether the US-China joint letter can match the " Yoshida letter . "  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
He reiterated that the development of Sino-US relations must be built on the basis of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the basic norms governing international relations such as mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , and non-interference in each other 's internal affairs .  
At the ceremony marking the publication of the first report from the forum " China and Her Neighbors , " a joint effort of the Wilton Park Conference , an independent British academic organization , and the Hong Kong Superior Resources Group , Wang Zhile pointed out that , faced with economic globalization , the developed nations and the developing nations alike should readjust the angles and ways in which they view the issue .  
Wang has conducted surveys of some joint venture enterprises in the coastal region of southern China , an area which is seen by many domestic and foreign companies as an excellent processing base , and as long as the design and standards for electronic products are provided , there are various ready-made associated facilities there , from raw materials and parts / components to assembly , etc .  
Wang Zhile surveyed some joint venture enterprises in southern China 's coastal area , which is regarded by many domestic and foreign corporations as the best processing base .  One only has to provide the designs and standards for electronic products , because all kinds of necessary factories , from raw materials , spare parts , to assembly , are already there .  
Base leaders and official personnel will be deeply involved in on-site training , directing the troops in drawing up concrete training plans , scientifically arranging the contents of training , conducting strict inspections and supervising the organization and implementation of training .  They will participate in researching and attacking difficult key problems , comprehensively coordinating the relations among all the troops participating in the training , providing relevant assurances to the troops , and making a preliminary exploration of the use of large-scale training bases to organize joint training for different branches of the armed forces .  
A combination of operational forces has been accelerated further through the wide use of microelectronic and software technologies with computers at the core , remote and sense technologies dominated by battlefield monitoring and target detection , and military high-tech , such as military engineering , antichemical , and military command and management technologies .  Meanwhile , a new situation of joint operations , with coordination between frontline and rear units , among three armed forces , and between the military and civilians , has taken shape .  
In reality , logistics service forces are not merely limited to " hard " services , such as material supplies , public health services , repairs , transportation , and engineering , but they should also provide information and other " soft " services .  In this way , they are able to properly bring their joint logistics capabilities into full play at opportune moments and in proper places .  
and difficulties in organizational coordination , modern joint operations can not compare to previous wars .  Relatively speaking , the joint logistics service levels of our military are fairly low .  Thus , joint logistics subunits should make a breakthrough in changing the current situation where logistics units and the units that they serve do not coordinate with each other in terms of planning and supplying and in the aspects of command and support .  
Most of the grass-roots units of this army unit are situated near the major center of the large-scale development of the western region , where the construction of some Sino-foreign joint venture projects have started with great momentum and to which tourists from afar , as well as Chinese and foreign reporters , are coming in a steady stream .  As a result , in the large-scale development of the western region , the unit has been subject to a grim test in terms of security work .  
We are willing to make joint efforts with Vietnamese comrades to develop better the relations between the two parties on the basis of independence , absolute equality , mutual respect , and mutual noninterference in each other 's internal affairs ; smoothly promote the two countries ' traditional friendly cooperative relations to a higher level ; and blaze a more beautiful future for the two countries ' relations in the 21st century .  
China advocates strengthening the dialogue and communications between developed countries and developing countries .  Together they must work out a set of rules that are in the interests of all nations and will promote joint economic development and establish a new international economic order that is fair and equitable so that all countries will benefit tangibly from economic globalization and the push for an information economy .  
This reporter has learned from a news briefing held by the Supreme People 's Procuratorate in Chongqing today that since the Supreme People 's Procuratorate and the Ministry of Public Security mapped out joint plans for a special operation on 18 January , initial success has been won in pursuing and arresting absconding suspects of embezzlement , bribery , and other crimes committed on duty .  So far , over 1,000 suspects have been arrested , including 270 who turned themselves in .  
has stepped up scientific and technological input in building a local network linking up its joint command center with its various county , township , and town bureaus for national defense mobilization purposes ; and has thus built a rapid mobilization system .  
2 .  Both sides point out that the two countries have , through joint efforts , established a legal basis of treaties and organizations for mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic and trade , science and technological , and cultural fields .  
7 .  Both sides confirm that they hold identical or similar views and stands on major international and regional issues at present and are willing to strengthen the two countries ' close cooperation in the United Nations and other international organizations and make joint efforts toward establishing new international political and economic orders that are just and rational .  
Taking the " Pine Gap joint air defense research facility " electronic reconnaisance base as an example , this is located in a remote site in central Australia , well screened by trees , and equipped with large antennae ; it can receive signals from US satellites through infrared sensors , collect many signals from radar , radio , and telephone signals from Asia and the Middle East , and can also detect the great heat produced by ballistic missile launches in any place on the Eurasian land mass .  
Yang Jiechi pointed out : The US Government has disregarded repeated solemn representations made by the Chinese government , and made the above wrongful decision .  Their act has completely violated relevant stipulations of the three Sino-US joint communiques , in particular the stipulations of the " August 17 " communique , and constituted a serious infringement upon China 's sovereignty and wanton interference in China 's internal affairs .  The Chinese government and people have expressed strong indignation and firm opposition to the decision .  
Regardless of the strong protest of the Chinese Government , the US Government announced on 23 April its decision to sell Taiwan several billion US dollars ' worth of advanced weapons , including " Kidd-class " destroyers , diesel-power submarines , and P-3 anti-submarine patrol aircraft .  This move taken by the US government is a flagrant breach of the principles stated in the three Sino-US joint communiques that the US Government has repeatedly committed itself to ;  
Since the decision has violated the US commitment written in black and white in the three Sino-US joint communiques , especially that in the " 17 August " communique , and has wantonly interfered in China 's internal affairs and brazenly challenged China 's sovereignty , the Chinese Government has lodged a strong protest and made solemn representations to the US Government on the issue .  
Having studied some burning issues in the current international and regional situation , the foreign ministers confirm in the joint communiqu ? that they have the same position and pledge to jointly commit to the further reinforcement and continuous improvement of the cooperation among the " Shanghai Five " in international affairs .  
A certain division of the Guangzhou Military Region has strengthened the construction of communication networks to ensure an easy access of joint logistics command channels and the good quality and high efficiency of joint logistics services .  Through communication networks , this division has assigned annual service quotas and targets and transmitted information to more than 300 subordinate units in an exactly right way .  
We believe that , with joint efforts of both the military and the people throughout the country , the law on national defense education will be carried out and implemented in a comprehensive manner , and China 's national defense education project will advance in a healthy manner .  We believe that the sense of " all-people " national defense and the cohesion of the Chinese nation will further be strengthened , and the peace-loving Chinese nation will certainly create a stronger national defense .  
This exercise was held in order to further test and perfect the US-ROK " 5027 " provisional joint combat plan , enhance the joint command and coordinated combat capability of the two armies , and raise the rapid reaction capability of the US-ROK joint forces in dealing with a sudden incident .  
The DPRK Nodong Sinmun published a commentary condemning the US-ROK joint military exercise as a " strategic provocation . "  It pointed out that the United States is attempting to continue to carry out its hostile policy of strangling the DPRK " by power , " and the US adventurist actions have poured cold water on the people of the Korean peninsula who earnestly desire national self-determination and reunification and a beautiful future .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Since ours are modernized compound armed forces formed by various services and arms and supported by some space technology , if the commanders of our ground divisions have never seen a warship , a fighter plane , a campaign missile , or a tactical missile , and if the commanders of our naval and air units have never learned about the characteristics of a modern ground campaign , we will definitely lose the most basic knowledge support in cultivating such a concept as joint operations .  
Thus apart from laying a solid foundation of knowledge , especially by taking a " general course " on directing joint operations in a military academy or school , our commanding officers should also devote more energy to learning and applying knowledge on different services and arms through peacetime campaign training exercises ; should work hard to learn about the basic formations of different services and arms as well as the functional features and operational principles of different types of weapons and equipment ;  
The US , Japanese , and British forces have all stressed the following two requirements : First , a senior commanding officer shall have received training in various military academies and schools before taking office ; Second , a senior commanding officer shall have served in different posts in different services before taking office .  These two requirements have laid a foundation for a senior commanding officer to direct joint operations .  
He stressed : We highly value the development of Sino-US ties .  We propose : Sino-US ties should be dealt with from a strategic and long-term perspective , and the differences between the two countries handled in a proper way .  China and the United States should maintain and develop healthy and stable bilateral ties based on the principles of the three Sino-US joint communiques and the norms governing international ties so as to benefit the people of the two countries .  
She called on various localities and departments to put into effect the guidelines of the National Work Meeting on Rectifying and Standardizing Market Economic Order conscientiously , further stress the key points , put the responsibility system into practice , and continue to carry out in a thoroughgoing way the joint action to severely crack down on the lawbreaking criminal activities of making and selling fake and shoddy products , so as to vigorously push forward the work of rectifying and standardizing market economic order .  
The joint action to crack down on fake products has effectively protected consumers ' interest and maintained market economic order , hence , it was welcome by the broad masses and the enterprises at home and abroad .  
First , not long ago , the United States ' Bush administration decided to adjust its military strategy and set forth a plan for deploying a global missile defense .  Before that , the United States had drawn Japan into its TMD ( theater missile defense ) program by forcing Japan to sign a cooperation agreement and get involved in the four-year program for joint technological research and development of the TMD system .  
Since China and Nepal established diplomatic relations in 1955 , the relations of friendly cooperation have developed in a sustained , healthy and stable manner thanks to the close attention and meticulous care of the leaders of the two countries as well as the joint efforts made by the two peoples .  
The Chinese side expounded the principled stand on the current bilateral relations and on the Taiwan issue , and stressed : China is willing to develop healthy and stable relations with the United States ; the three Sino-US joint communiques and basic norms of international relations should be abided by .  
The report states : To pursue the new Asia strategy , the United States should make significant readjustments of its military deployments in the Asia-Pacific region , such as shifting the focus of its regional military deployments to South Asia from Northeast Asia , developing and improving the military security network with its allies , building Guam into a military center of the United States in Asia , strengthening joint air and naval forces , and developing its long-distance fighting capability .  
Article 2 : These guiding opinions are applicable to those joint stock limited companies that were formed in accordance with the " Company Law " and are planning to make an initial public offering of shares ( hereinafter referred to as " companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market " ) within the People 's Republic of China .  
Article 17 : Other enterprises that are looking to incorporate companies planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market shall form joint stock limited companies in compliance with the relevant provisions in the " Company Law " and in accordance with the requirements for standardized restructuring and complete reorganization , or they shall incorporate as joint stock limited companies by undergoing a complete transformation .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
The Central Military Commission recently decided to select middle - and high-ranking cadres working in one branch of the military to receive training given by a military academy under another branch of the military .  This created a new training model that will certainly be an important driving force in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations in modern - - and particularly high-tech - - wars .  
Even though in the case of a joint combat battlefield centering around ground forces the traditional one-dimensional support model for covering the entire in-depth battlefield may still ensure combat needs , with the unprecedented rapid development of multidimensional space in the joint combat battlefields of the future , only through the comprehensive utilization of a variety of support methods in multidimensional space will it be possible to ensure the demand of combat operations for logistical support .  
What stable supply and maintenance support links refers to is the integrated use of various support means , with pre-combat support deployment serving as the base , to form a multidimensional logistical support network for the entire in-depth joint combat battlefield , including supply and support links in which the replenishment of ammunition is a key point , technical support links in which the maintenance of new and high-tech equipment is a key point , and knowledge support links in which troops with special skills are the key points .  
It is not hard to discover that the idea running through these specific items is that , in organizing logistical support for joint combat , information sharing is the foundation , the optimal deployment of support resources is the goal , and technical cooperation is the key .  
The massive utilization of high-tech equipment has established a firm material foundation for joint combat , and at the same time it is giving an increasingly stronger intellectual and knowledge orientation to logistical support .  The contradiction between the lack of enough skilled specialists and the growing quantities of new and high-tech equipment will become more pronounced .  
The US Government has ignored China 's solemn representations on many occasions and is bent on allowing Chen Shui-bian to " transit through " the United States . This has violated the three joint communiques between China and the United States and relevant commitments made by the United States , encouraged the swollen arrogance of the " Taiwan independence " forces , and wantonly interfered in China 's internal affairs .  
The European Parliament highly values the correct position adopted by China in the Asian financial crisis a few years ago , and is glad to see that China has made great achievements in its socialist modernization and in maintaining social stability , and enabling its people to live and work happily and peacefully .  It is willing to make joint efforts with the Chinese side in strengthening cooperation in the political , economic , trade , and financial fields , and make greater efforts to advance the comprehensive development of European-Chinese relations .  
Sino-US ties will move along a normal track so long as both sides abide by the three Sino-US joint communiques and such basic norms governing international ties on mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual nonaggression , and noninterference in each other 's internal affairs .  
Shan Jie has also spared no effort to mobilize the local masses to collect and purchase Wulingzhi , Yizhihao , Hongjingtian , and other natural medicinal herbs which grow on the plateau , and has set up Tibet Kangda Medicines Company Ltd . as the first " joint venture enterprise on the plateau . "  As a result , the county 's annual financial revenue has risen by 6 million yuan .  
The Russian navy will make no major adjustment of its setup .  In the future the Russian navy will gradually increase joint naval exercises , organize mobile groups of a temporary nature , and dispatch special mixed formations to important sea areas so as to restore the past gallant appearance of the navy .  
Thanks to the joint efforts of both sides , significant progress has been made in our bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties , and excellent results have been achieved in mutually beneficial cooperation in all spheres .  We are happy to see that China 's NPC and the National Assembly of the ROK have also established and maintained friendly ties .  
To continue to give in-depth publicity to and conduct extensive education in the legal system nationwide , it involves large areas and arduous tasks ; under the unified leadership of party committees and governments at corresponding levels and with the vigorous support and supervision of people 's congresses and local committees of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , various regions should persist in integrating themselves with relevant departments , take coordinated action , and bring the enthusiasm of localities , industries , and departments into full play in order to form a joint force in work .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
If cadres are characterized by a uniform quality structure and simple experiences , with infantry officers not understanding the various branches of the military , cadres of the various branches of the military not understanding the issue of being composite , political cadres not understanding military matters , and military cadres not being able to do political work , such a state of affairs in terms of quality will not meet the requirements of joint operations in the context of informationization .  
The Russian military has actively organized joint air defense exercises and anti-terrorist exercises with countries of the CIS , held military conferences with the CIS , enforced joint air defenses , and helped concerned countries restore radar early warning systems .  The Russian military has also provided countries of the CIS with modern air-defense missile system and warplanes .  Russia and countries of the CIS have now gradually established a unified air defense system and formed an effective defense and deterrent capability .  
During the meeting , senior officials agreed unanimously that under the current circumstances where the economic development in the region is faced with uncertain factors , member economies of APEC should make joint efforts in continuously sticking to the progress of trade and investment liberalization .  
To this end , India has designed a series of diplomatic steps : In 1996 , India for the first time joined the Regional Forum of ASEAN and in 2000 , its defense minister paid a visit to Japan and the two countries conducted a joint military exercise in the South China Sea , which has laid a foundation for India to be militarily involved in the South China Sea and signified that India has stridden over the second door in the process of " eastward expansion " .  
It is worth pondering that after this multinational joint exercise , this naval task fleet of India did not leave the region , but on the contrary continued to stay there .  Moreover , it was joined by one more " Kilo " class submarine and several antisubmarine patrol aircrafts to continue their unilateral naval exercise .  
Since last year , Japan and India have constantly strengthened their cooperation in military and other fields , established a partnership relationship , conducted many joint military exercises , jointly cracked down on those pirates threatening Japan 's energy passage at sea , and weakened the strategic pressures brought about by China to Japan at sea . 
If in trying to understand joint operations , we failed to recognize the temporal background and essential characteristics of their birth and development or failed to recognize the essential distinction between informationized warfare and mechanized warfare , it would tie our understanding down to the level of concerted and combined operations .  Consequently , the commanding ideology would lag behind the times .  
In our research and explorations , we should be mindful of avoiding and overcoming research methods that are isolated and focus on separate points only , be mindful of avoiding and overcoming the conventional thinking that looks at only a single , specific object , and observe and analyze issues from multiple dimensions and angles , so that our research takes on more characteristics of the times and that the theory and practice of joint operations can better cater to the development of the times .  
Your distinguished nation has pursued a foreign policy of maintaining independence and keeping initiative in one 's own hands , has protected world peace and promoted joint progress , and has played an increasingly important role in international and regional affairs .  
With the joint efforts of the cadres and masses , this traditional major wheat - and cotton-producing county has presented a gratifying situation in which multiple industries including wheat , cotton , fruits , Chinese medicinal herbs , vegetables , flowers , and processing of agricultural products are developed simultaneously .  
A joint command will have to concentrate both qualified and capable command personnel and technologically advanced command facilities .  On the basis of guaranteeing efficient operation , a joint command will have to set up fewer vertical command links , and recruit fewer but highly capable personnel , aside from constantly studying new command measures , and raising command efficiency , thus ensuring timely , highly efficient , and acute command , and unleashing overall operational efficiency to the greatest extent , in a key zone , and at a crucial juncture .  
As joint operations waged under modern conditions involve a large number of precision-guided weapons , intelligent weapons , as well as the C4ISR system , which serves as " nerves and brains " for different weapons systems and military command systems , concentration of military strength is now increasingly dependent upon a commander 's enormous potential unleashed via an information system , and upon a perfect integration of different weapons systems and information systems .  
Given this , and as proven by a series of recent local wars , in joint operations , aside from concentrating " capability " for a strike aimed at destroying the enemy 's " hardware " , such as personnel and arms , a belligerent will also have to concentrate superior forces and lethal weapons for a strike at the enemy 's weapons systems , information systems , logistic support systems , and especially at their vital and vulnerable points , in order to paralyze the enemy 's vital systems . 
As an old saying goes , " the strength of a tree can be tested by strong winds , and real gold can be distinguished with fire " .  Over the past 50 years , with the profound care of the leaders of the two countries and the joint efforts of the people of the two countries , the across-the-board friendship between the two countries withstood various tests , and was firmly maintained and continuously developed , becoming a model of friendly coexistence of countries with different social systems .  
He said : To safeguard regional security , the countries of the " Shanghai Five " should take joint actions in dealing blows at religious extremism , international terrorism , organized crime , drug trafficking , and arms smuggling .  At the same time , they should also expand cooperation in the economic , cultural , educational , scientific , and technological fields .  
After the Kosovo war , the United States military and congress unanimously affirmed the policy decision to , after the Gulf war , strengthen the improvement and production of geographic information and precision guidance weapons .  At the same time , they decided , beginning in the year 2000 , to increase by $ 1.2-billion every year the money provided to install global satellite navigation reception equipment on more joint direct attack weapons , joint weapon-launching systems outside defensive areas , and bombs and missiles of joint voice channel monitoring weapons .  
The military branches of other NATO nations , at the same time as they are reforming and strengthening their geographic information assurance , also want to increase the number of equipment retrofit kits adaptable to the NAVSTAR GPS on their missiles , bombs , weapon-launching platforms , electronic surveillance and intelligence systems - - in accordance with the demands of United States military joint combat - - to heighten the global positioning and navigation level of various kinds of munitions .  
The " Shanghai Five " mechanism advocates good neighborly relations , mutual trust , equality , mutual benefits , unity , cooperation , and joint development .  It has provided the international community with valuable experience and inspiration in abandoning the Cold War mentality and in actively exploring for a new type of state-to-state relations , a new type of security view , and a new type of regional cooperation model in the post-Cold War era , and has made positive contributions to world peace and stability .  
As far as capital - and technology-intensive industries are concerned , therefore , if they only look inward , they are bound to be hit hard by China 's accession to WTO and may even collapse .  But if they seize the initiative to set up joint ventures with foreign investors and put foreign funds , technology , and management to use , they will put themselves in an invincible position .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
It was revealed that the Nationalist forces have already listed a series of missile development programs in the Academia Sinica 's secret budget for projects like " special missile national defense technology " and " joint air defense and counteroffensive , " and such missile development programs include : Hsiungfeng III supersonic anti-ship missiles , which are being developed under " The Hsiungping Program , " and are scheduled for a control test on their initial versions later this year ;  
In the new period of reform , opening up , and modernization , the party established and developed the patriotic united front , extensively united Chinese people at home and abroad , in the course of consistently carrying out the basic line of " one center , two basic points " , to make joint efforts for deepening reforms , expanding opening-up , speeding up development , safeguarding stability , promoting the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao , and promoting the development of cross-strait relations .  Great achievements attracting worldwide attention were achieved in this regard .  
In accordance with the overall plans for stopping the source and blocking the flow of drugs , public security and anti-narcotics departments as well as border defense , customs control , railroad , communications , civil aviation and other related departments in Yunnan , Guangxi and Guizhou in China 's southwestern region have further improved their investigation networks as well as their comprehensive multi-force joint operations , thus effectively cutting off the frantic infiltration of drugs into our country .  
Over the past few years , thanks to the joint efforts exerted by the entire party and the whole society , the essential aspect of the style of thinking and moral qualities of the whole society is active , healthy and progressive .  Gratifying changes have taken place in the mental outlook of our people .  
The responsible comrades of the Party committees and governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities , members of the for the joint conference on the educational activities of studying the important thinking of " three represents " in the rural areas , and others respectively attended the teleconference at branch meeting places in localities concerned .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
He then pointed out that the potential for expansion of economic relations between Belarus and China is far from being fully developed .  Measures must continue to be taken , and a new scope of cooperation and new projects must be identified .  The current pattern of pure trade must transform into more modern , more advanced methods of cooperation , such as joint research , development , and production of high-tech products .  
In the past 10 years , Sino-Russian relations have developed from " regarding each other as friendly countries " to " constructive partnership , " and then " strategic cooperative partnership of equality and mutual trust geared to the 21st century , " and the two heads of state have signed over 10 joint statements and declarations , which set a series of important principles for constantly strengthening , deepening and substantiating bilateral relations .  
They have also dispatched the fleet to the sea to conduct test training in different sea areas and under different weather conditions .  They have successively completed more than 30 difficult training courses , including replenishment in rocky areas at night , round-the-clock comprehensive supplies from all directions , replenishment in strong waves and winds , and joint logistical replenishment tasks by military and civilian vessels .  
In recent years , the base 's relevant departments have repeatedly organized rapid mobilization of maritime medical teams from its hospital and urgently dispatched them for training in sea rescue , with some of them participating in the highly difficult joint ship-airplane rescue drills .  
China and Russia will further strengthen strategic cooperation , together advance the world multipolarization process and the building of a democratic , fair , and rational new economic order , and work together to preserve world peace and promote joint development , This is the objective requirement of the current development of the international situation and is also the unshirkable major responsibility of the two countries .  
The leading official emphatically pointed out : Over the years , the journalistic circles across the strait have given scope to their irreplaceable positive role in improving mutual understanding and communication between the people across the strait .  Thanks to their joint efforts , the development of news exchanges across the strait has not been easy to come by and has to be jointly cherished and maintained by both sides of the strait .  
The communique says , the two leaders affirm that their stances on a whole series of major international issues are identical or similar ; both advocate strengthening their coordination and close cooperation within the framework of the United Nations and other international organizations , and will make joint efforts to establish a fair and rational new international political and economic order .  
We are willing to continue to strengthen cooperation in the international arena and make joint efforts to promote the establishment of a democratic , fair and rational new international political and economic order and to create a new world of lasting peace and universal prosperity .  
Shuai Hwa-min pointed out that , speaking of this current phase , Taiwan-US military exchanges certainly have their necessity and importance , but this kind of exchange , rather , is not the kind which can generate a military alliance and actual troop joint military exercises , which is what the people of the nation are hoping for .  The biggest key factor is that the two sides are nations without diplomatic relations .  Therefore , future Taiwan-US military exchanges will continue to be low key , but they will be conducted in an essentially advancing way .  
To prove that all this is not non-existent , the US Department of Defense recently also announced that it would provide Taiwan a " joint tactical information transmission system " worth $ 725-million and transform Taiwan 's " joint operation command center of the three armed services " and the operation command centers of various types of units , so that the United States and Taiwan could be linked through identical operation command systems .  
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations . "  
For several days running , fishermen braved the sweltering heat and the choppy water alongside the unit 's officers and men .  Together they assembled , laid low waiting for the right opportunity , set off rapidly , and launched joint attacks , thereby honing their skills in carrying out joint attack , defense , and rescue operations at sea .  
In order to ensure harbor safety and a smooth navigation channel during wartime , the unit made full use of local fishing vessels in their preparations for military struggles and regarded conducting joint military-civilian sea drills to " launch counterattacks on small-scale enemies " an important study subject .  After repeated deliberations and verifications , the unit drew up a plan to build a combined formation of corvettes and armed fishing vessels and lay down the principle for allocating men and equipment .  
The provision for a department to be in charge of a Sino-foreign joint venture was a result of the planned economic system of those days .  After the economic structural reform , government administration have been separated from enterprise management , and administrative organs separated from enterprises .  Under the socialist market economic conditions , in particular , enterprises enjoyed full authority to make their own managerial decisions , and the government mainly carried out macro-direction and is not supposed to intervene in enterprises ' specific production and operational activities .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
Increasingly , Xinjiang 's ethnic separatist forces abroad have tended to join forces in launching attacks , replacing scattered operations with regional operations , and even with transregional , transnational , multi-level , and joint operations , and such an initial tendency may be viewed at the following three levels : 
On 9 May , the State Council held the second video and telephone conference on nationally coordinated operation to crack down on the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities and made arrangements for the nationwide joint operation against the making and selling of counterfeit and shoddy commodities , focusing on food , medicines , agricultural supplies , cotton , and illegally assembled automobiles using cannibalized parts .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
Logistics support must be adapted to such circumstances in order to meet the need of frequent level changes in a joint operation .  This calls for a system in which the organs are streamlined , levels reduced , functions clearly defined , and relationship smooth so as to realize an integral operation from strategic logistics to tactical logistics .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
Not long ago , ChinaNet launched a formidable offensive in Chongqing , Hangzhou , and Shandong 's Zibo , either by forming a joint venture with a local government-run operation or by forging an alliance with a local radio , movie , and television operation in order to bring lasting pressure to bear on China Telecom in the telecommunications field , especially in the future broadband business .  
In 1998 . a delegation led by Comrade Luo Gan attended the 20th special United National Assembly on narcotics control , putting forward a three-point proposal of " adhering to the principle of extensive participation and joint responsibility , implementing a comprehensive and balanced international narcotics-control strategy in an all-round way , and paying attention to substitution and development , " which received close attention and favorable comments by various countries .

"  
In the article Wang Hui pointed out that despite an unusual development in cross-strait relations , trade between the two sides of the strait continued to set an all-time record in 1999 and the contracted Taiwan investment amount still posted more than 10-percent point increase , thanks to the joint efforts of the business and industrial circles of the two sides of the strait .  The growth of the mainland exports to Taiwan , however , was down and the actual Taiwan investment amount continued to slide .  
Observers are convinced that the extensive common understanding reached by leaders of the two countries in their meetings and the joint communique signed by leaders of the two countries constitute a telling blow to Xinjiang 's separatist force in Turkey .

Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Its methodology is based upon today 's Voluntary High School Admissions Program , which adopts a five-level grade scoring system . ( This program , implemented in an experimental phase in 1990 , allows participating junior high students to advance to high school based on written application forms and school grades , rather than performance on the joint entrance exam . )  
In the blueprint drawn up by the Ministry of Education , because vocational high schools will be exam-free , students below 18 years of age will experience the opportunity to make an independent choice . Whether they want to go to high school and then to university , or to go the way of vocational education , their direction will be determined in advance , so the number of candidates sitting for the university joint entrance examination will probably be smaller than it is today .  
And before the old ailment could be cured , the patient contracted a new illness : pressures for academic advancement began growing heavier and heavier . The joint entrance exam system is a modern version of the imperial civil service examination system , and it pushes down on modern children so much they scarcely can breathe .  
Wu Lung-shan points out that the results of these tests for all elementary schools , junior and senior high schools ( including vocational schools ) will be completed by October of this year , and at that time it will be possible to make a long-term plan for developing the nation 's physical fitness based on those results . What 's more , Minister of Education Wu Ching has proposed an idea of allowing points to be added to the joint entrance exams based on level of physical fitness .  
Take for example illegal entry into the exclusive maritime economic zone to catch fish . Last May , the Taiwanese ship Tung Heng # 3 , which is supposed to operate only in the high seas , was painted red to give it the false appearance of a joint venture ship , and entered into the economic zone .  
In many of the more remote mountain districts , the population drain has led to Earth Lords being consolidated together for joint worship , while in major industrial areas , and sites where large development projects are in progress , numerous Earth Lords , suddenly deprived of their own hideaways , now have to cram together at a single altar .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
So long as there is dialogue in a friendly atmosphere , we can constructively discuss any topics . As for formal negotiation , as distinguished from dialogue , we think that urgent humanitarian issues concerning the lives and rights of peoples across the Taiwan Strait should come first . These include fishing disputes , repatriation of illegal immigrants , joint efforts to fight crime , protection of Taiwanese tourists in the mainland , and so on . In addition we can move forward on plans like agricultural cooperation or sharing experiences in the reform of state-run enterprises .  
In fact , the various statements made by PRC officials at APEC were unsurprising . What was unexpected and regrettable was the lopsided bias toward mainland China displayed by New Zealand Foreign Minister Don McKinnon . At a joint ministerial press conference , he prevented ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang from speaking , while allowing PRC officials to answer in his place , and he prevented Taiwan reporters from speaking on several occasions .  
Beginning in 2001 , English will become a required course in elementary schools . " Now the English parts of both the college and high-school joint entrance exams are growing trickier . Whether one is talking about written tests or oral tests , they both require excellent English , " says Chang Yu-heng senior staff editor for Landmark English . It 's only natural that students need English magazines to bolster their efforts to learn the language .  
In 1990 , the Ministry of Education announced a new policy , called somewhat misleadingly the " self-study plan , " which provided junior high school students with an option of seeking senior high school admission without taking the joint entrance exam . Scores in five different areas of school performance ( ethical , intellectual , physical , group spirit , and aesthetic ) started being used in place of a single score in the joint entrance exam for determining senior high school admissions .  
This makes for six separate admissions tracks : ( 1 ) the joint entrance exam or BCT track , ( 2 ) the recommendation track , ( 3 ) the application track , ( 4 ) the earlier implemented grades-oriented " self-study " program , ( 5 ) the direct promotion of some students from junior high schools affiliated with senior high schools , and ( 6 ) the exams for students gifted at math , science or languages .  
In contrasting multiple-track admissions to the joint entrance exam , he says , " The joint exam was like a general ledger : only the final figure counted , so that eventual success could wipe clean earlier failures . But the problem was that children just had one way to succeed . What 's worth applauding about multiple-track admissions is that it lets children with different sets of strengths all have a chance to get ahead . "  
At a time when multi-track admissions have yet to meet with widespread support among parents and teachers , an unfortunate incident occurred at the end of February . It was discovered that students at about a dozen junior high schools had been leaked the answers to the mock joint exams . This led to fears that the multiple track admissions policy was not as fair as the joint entrance exam .  
The biggest weak point of the joint entrance exam is that only people that excel on pen-and-paper examinations come out on top . People with a strong spatial sense , musical talent or athletic prowess are neglected . The movement to replace the joint entrance exam is based on this kind of reasoning .  
The gifted students were assigned to normal classes , and it was only for math that they came together for a special class . Yet their math teacher felt that they still needed to go deeper and cover more ground . The math covered at school simply was n't enough , so they all enrolled in supplementary " cram school " classes as well . Mrs . Liu realized that the joint entrance exam questions got easier every year and that thus the essay might be the section that would determine her daughter 's fate .  
In particular , there have been salient achievements in the pluralization of education . The joint college entrance exam system , which has dominated educational thinking for nearly half a century , is about to be abolished , and other topics such as women 's rights , children 's issues , workers ' rights and environmental protection have all come to the fore as campaign issues at one time or another .  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
Yu Shyi-kun , Secretary-General of the Presidential Office , stated that the president would respect the ruling of the Grand Justices , but said the language of the ruling does not appear to require a Cabinet reshuffle . The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed , " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet 's unilateral action illegal , and the Cabinet 's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason .  
" There are still good students who select an agricultural college on account of the academic reputation of the university , " notes Hsu . " But with the abolition of the joint entrance examination next year , agricultural colleges are concerned that there 'll be a big drop in the quality of students they can attract . " With today 's changing circumstances , it is imperative for agricultural colleges to alter their approach . It 's both a crisis , and an opportunity .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
At the same time , he has worked all his life in his capacity as an individual artist to promote contemporary Taiwanese art both at home and abroad . To this end , he has organized countless solo and joint exhibits , talked his good friend and printmaker Chu Wei-pai into opening an art gallery , introduced to Taiwan 's art community the works of such expatriate painters as Charng Yuh and Chao Wu-chi , and done many other things to inject renewed life into Taiwan 's arts scene .  
In April 2001 , Culturecom and mainland China 's People 's Education Press ( PEP ) , which is under the control of the PRC education ministry , announced that they were launching a joint venture to set up Renwen E-Textbook Technology Company . Their aim is to develop the mainland 's primary and secondary school textbook market , which serves a student population numbering in the hundreds of millions . PEP will be responsible for course planning and content , while Culturecom will provide support with e-book technology .  
But as things have developed , and with strong support from the Council for Cultural Affairs , it has become ever richer in content , and moved toward being an " all-new , all-round operatic production " that combines the beauty of Peking Opera and Western opera . A key role in this joint creation is played by performers from the opera troupe of the Fu Hsing Dramatic Arts Academy .  
Chang Chao-tang was born to a family of doctors in Panchiao , Taipei County . A smart kid , he was granted admission to Taipei 's prestigious Cheng Kung Senior High School based on his outstanding academic record alone , so that he did n't need to take the joint entrance exam .

The consensus reached reflected the commonality of purpose and the initiatives taken should significantly advance joint action against organized criminality , which undermined national development , economic stability , social peace and public safety .  
Equally satisfying in our opinion is the compromise solution reached after long discussion , namely to circulate as an official document of the General Assembly a single compendium including the valuable joint assessment , prepared by the two Vice-Chairmen in their personal capacity , of the two rolling papers on clusters 1 and 2 , as well as proposals and contributions presented by individual countries and groups of countries .  
In addition to its regular annual session , during 1994 JUNIC held two ad hoc sessions to develop and coordinate the implementation of joint information activities in connection with the major international conferences scheduled for 1994 and 1995 , and in particular with the World Summit for Social Development and the Fourth World Conference on Women .

Having held fruitful and extensive but not conclusive discussions on the item of the criteria for joint implementation at its eighth , ninth , tenth , and eleventh sessions ,  
The benefits expected of joint implementation are to be seen , inter alia , in an intensified transfer of capital , investments , technology and know-how with positive impetus to the development process in the countries involved , under the condition that joint implementation activities are in line with national development priorities and strategies , and in a more efficient use of scarce resources to reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions worldwide .

It is generally accepted that such sharing of experience and expertise among the developing countries using the TCDC modality often develop into ECDC arrangements , which comprise practical and collective economic actions among developing countries , requiring for the most part capital investment and / or major joint ventures .  
Cooperation in the context of subregional and regional action programmes includes agreed joint programmes for the sustainable management of transboundary natural resources , scientific and technical cooperation and strengthening of relevant institutions .  
It aims at training senior managers of Chinese military enterprises for conversion to production of civilian goods for the domestic and world markets , and facilitating joint ventures by bringing together major domestic and international investors from the private sector in the most attractive and committed Chinese enterprises .

Though coordination has been enhanced and joint initiatives have multiplied , much still needs to be done to develop a comprehensive network of systematic relationships that will exploit the potential of this United Nations programme and its professional contributions in key areas . 
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .

Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
Given the persistence of such environmental problems as the lack of drinking water , threats to biological diversity , the depletion of the ozone layer , the warming of the atmosphere , the diminishing soil productivity , desertification and diminishing food security , Governments of both industrialized and developing countries must take joint , concerted action .

Its objective is to improve the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors , and to facilitate their participation in the major social programmes through joint efforts by State and regional institutions , non-governmental organizations and civil society .  
This joint effort is most appropriate when we recall that we are living in an era in which society realizes that big government and its programmes sometimes give rise to more expenditure than advantages and that fiscal responsibility is of more benefit to the economy than is the multiplication of governmental departments , especially in the developing countries , where the public sector is still suffering the consequences of large-scale programmes that have not produced the results expected .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
This is a major responsibility of our territorial sovereignty and brings with it an inheritance of advances in technology , human labour and rapid interocean transportation in sum , the successful development of a valuable resource for worthy joint activities of benefit above all to the people of Panama and in general to all the peoples of the Earth .  
This is because of the close interrelationship and joint interests among members of the international community and the common destiny that binds us together once we recognize that we live in a global village in which geographic borders can not protect others from the physical or mental effects of those problems .  
The objectives of the Community , as defined in the Treaty of Chaguaramas inter alia , economic cooperation through the Caribbean Common Market ; coordinated foreign policies ; and creating joint services in such essential sectors as health , education , culture , communications and industrial relations have been methodically pursued through the establishment of appropriate Community structures by its member States .

Japan believes that while all these efforts may not be part and parcel of the direct negotiations between the parties themselves , they have proved to be extremely constructive in the sense that such developments , with their enhanced prospects for regional cooperation in the areas of environment , tourism and economic joint ventures , can serve as a catalyst for the promotion of mutual confidence among the parties and for the creation of brighter prospects for the future of regional cooperation among the parties .  
Operative paragraph 1 reaffirms the work to be done by the joint Mission of the United Nations and the Organization of American States : monitoring full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Haiti , providing technical assistance for institutional development in police training and in the establishment of an impartial judicial system and supporting the development of programmes for the promotion and protection of human rights to ensure coexistence and the consolidation of democracy and institutions in Haiti .

Despite the initiatives and the relentless efforts of members of the Gulf Cooperation Council during the past few years to contain the devastating effects of the conflicts in the Arab Gulf region , which has great importance to regional and international strategies , and their continuing endeavour to support progress towards joint reconstruction and cooperation , the unstable political and security conditions in the region remain a source of concern for us .  
This is particularly true in the developing and least developed regions that continue to suffer from the spread of poverty , unemployment and illiteracy , as well as the burden of foreign debts , in addition to fluctuations in the rates of exchange and several other problems .  The creation of an equitable and just economic environment built on a foundation of cooperation requires joint efforts by developing countries on the one hand , and by developing and developed countries on the other .  
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
Through our Madrid joint statement , by which we stand , it has been put to our neighbour to respect the existing overall framework of international law and treaties that has defined our borders and relations and has stood unchallenged for the last 70 years , and to desist from aggressive policies , refrain from territorial claims and submit to the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice any argument it might deem valid concerning the islet of Imia .  
The very fact that the most diametrically opposed positions have used contradictory numerical estimates makes us think that these calculations could change if applied one by one to all the separate paragraphs and subparagraphs of the groups or clusters that a joint decision would contain that is , on the questions of permanent members , non-permanent members , rotation , discrimination , the veto , procedural matters , working methods and so forth . 
During the past three years we have made extraordinary progress in our integration efforts , which extend from a new conceptual horizon , one that has become better balanced and more inclusive with the creation of the Alliance for Sustainable Development and the establishment of innovative regional projects to increase regional competitiveness by means of joint efforts on the part of Governments , academic centres and sectors of production . 
Those who are familiar with Central American history and aware of our current efforts in the various fields of integration know that Central American union is not simply an act of faith ; it is , rather , a work of engineering , an enormous undertaking that , taking into account the unique qualities of each of our States , is the key to the exercise of joint sovereignty .  
The parties agreed on a list of priority sites and a preliminary timetable for the clearing of unburied mortal remains , and established a joint expert commission consisting of two forensic pathologists from each party , with the task of implementing the agreed _ upon inter-party exhumations .  
Yet , one might assume that at least in part it is the result of more stringent enforcement of existing and new anti _ racist and anti _ terrorist laws , brought about through joint efforts of Jewish and other national and international organizations and agencies , ranging from the Anti _ Defamation League and the World Jewish Congress to the European Union and the United Nations Human Rights Committee , and from security services to parliaments and juridical associations .  
As you may be aware , the agreements on Hebron do not only refer to the redeployment of Israeli military forces in the city , but also to agreed security arrangements , joint security measures , the deployment of the Palestinian police and various civilian matters relating to the normal and effective functioning of the city , and the Israeli and Palestinian populations therein .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
The incentives for developed countries to participate in joint implementation programmes could be substantially enhanced through the establishment of binding commitments on global and national emission reduction targets ( which are absent during the current AIJ pilot phase of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , and are due for review at the end of the decade ) .  
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
Agenda 21 has proved to be the starting point for many new business initiatives with sustainability as their stated objective , with notable progress in the areas of joint industry / government partnerships and the development of innovative policy instruments , environmentally efficient technologies and products , and broader sustainability concerns regarding the relation of business and the wider community .  
In central and eastern Europe , where the implementation rate according to the above figures is already somewhat higher than in the other two regions under review , recent regional initiatives aim at the introduction of harmonized legal , infrastructural and logistic conditions that would allow countries in the same subregion to conduct joint controlled deliveries .  
Future activities envisaged by the resource committee on correctional systems and rights include a model seminar using the Manual for other central and eastern European States , the use of selected parts of the Manual in a seminar on prisoners rights for African participants , a joint initiative with Penal Reform International and an international symposium planned for the third quarter of 1997 .

Particular emphasis should be given to the cooperative and collaborative efforts of the landlocked and transit developing countries in dealing with the transit problems , inter alia , through improving the transit transport infrastructure facilities and bilateral agreements to govern transit transport operations ; development of joint ventures in the area of transit transport ; and strengthening of institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport .  
In July 1996 , an important joint letter addressed to the staff of IMF and that of UNDP on cooperation between the two organizations was signed by their two executive heads , who called on their members to collaborate more closely on new and ongoing technical assistance , country strategy notes ( when requested by Governments ) and policy framework papers and stressing the need for greater collaboration in post - and near-crisis countries and in countries engaged in programmes involving market-oriented reforms and transition .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The consultations had provided an opportunity for agencies to present their activities and to discuss possible cooperation on , for example : joint input to the Commission on Human Rights , the Sub-Commission and the Working Group , the provision of relevant information to be included on a website page , joint minority-related technical cooperation projects , submission of information on system-wide complaints procedures , input into the treaty bodies , dissemination of the recommendations and resolutions of supervisory bodies , and the provision of training on minority-related human rights instruments at regional and national levels .

The memorandum of understanding has paved the way for increased levels of cooperation , including discussion of possible joint missions to assess and address the needs of separated minors and other groups identified as particularly vulnerable and the establishment of common standards and practices .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
The first series of SCD satellites manufactured in Brazil , designed for environmental data collection , had proved a success , the development of the necessary technologies for the Brazilian satellite launching vehicle had been completed , progress had also been made in the implementation of the joint Chinese-Brazilian project on the remote sensing of earth resources , and a cooperation agreement had been concluded with the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) .  
The Government has also set in motion the Social Solidarity Network , a strategy that aims at improving the living conditions of the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and initiating large social programmes through joint efforts of State-owned and territorial institutions , non-governmental organizations and the civil society .  
Furthermore , the Inter-Agency Standing Committee during its meeting held in March 1997 , recognized the need to put in place a simple joint monitoring system for humanitarian assistance programmes that would ensure accountability , transparency , optimum utilization of resources , avoid potential duplication efforts , and adjust to changing situations , issues which have not fully been addressed in humanitarian programmes to date .  
The highest aim in their common belief is the human dimension of this joint initiative , which , as a continuing process , through comprehensive cooperation , should provide rapid economic development and prosperity to the peoples of the region .  
Reaffirming the commitment made by the Member States under Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action , giving full importance to developing effective international cooperation for the achievement of the purposes set forth in Article 55 of the Charter concerning universal respect for , and observance of , human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ,

Rather , it rests with the selfish and unilateral policies of the controlling Powers , whose interests can not be served by using the United Nations mechanisms established for the correct application of the principles and rules of the Charter , which reflect the joint will and collective interests of the members of the international community . 
Regardless of what the Charter provides in terms of rights , duties and procedures , we are convinced that the doctrine of presumed humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous destructive tool that affects the gains that have accrued through joint efforts in favour of the general international interest , as evidenced by the records of this Organization .  
We are confident that the adoption of draft resolution A 54 L . 12 , just introduced by the Ambassador of Burkina Faso , will serve as another basis for promoting in the coming year joint activities which fall within the common purposes of both organizations , whose goals are to ensure international cooperation in seeking solutions to international economic , social , cultural and humanitarian problems .

We know that this can only be done if all the people concerned , at the local , national , regional and international levels , are fully committed through joint and coordinated efforts and actions .  
All these initiatives are aimed at adopting joint coordinated action at the international , regional and national levels with a view to contributing to establishing lasting peace in regions threatened or affected by conflicts .  
That very unfavourable situation is also reflected in a joint report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe mission in Kosovo , which was recently published in Pristina . That report stresses , in particular , that there is still an unacceptably high level of ethnic intolerance , discrimination and violence in the province , as well as inadequate security and insufficient freedom of movement .  
Finally , I would like to express our fervent hope that through the joint efforts of the two parties , assisted by the international community , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be ultimately resolved so that peace will return to the entire Middle East region and the peoples of Palestine and Israel will enjoy living side by side in their own countries , secure in peace , prosperity and dignity .  
Preliminary discussions with UNCHS identified the following areas of possible cooperation for further consideration : ( a ) substantive support to the Special Rapporteur in carrying out his mandate ; ( b ) developing a joint United Nations housing rights programme and , in this context , supporting the UNCHS Global Campaign on Secure Tenure as a component of housing rights ; ( c ) promoting integration of a housing rights component in field operations , advisory services and technical cooperation activities ; and ( d ) contributing to the Istanbul + 5 process .  
Expressing its approval of the implementing measures taken by member States in accordance with its decisions and commending the efforts of the Ministerial Council and the GCC ministerial committees to establish a solid economic , cultural and social foundation that will meet the requirements of the future and reinforce the joint action process , the Supreme Council declares the importance of the following :  
The Council therefore strongly encouraged Governments to pursue and strengthen their efforts to work towards achieving the goals of poverty eradication and reiterated the call for the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and the international community to take consistent , coherent , coordinated and joint action in support of national efforts to eradicate poverty , with particular attention to employment creation and work and the empowerment and advancement of women .  
The experiences reported covered a wide and interesting spectrum , ranging from educational nanosatellites and microsatellites in two universities in Argentina to some small-to-medium-sized , fairly sophisticated satellites devoted to operational application missions , especially for remote sensing , such as the joint initiative being studied by Argentina and Brazil .  
Accordingly , the European Union had decided to support the reforms undertaken in UNIDO since the adoption of the Business Plan at the 1997 General Conference , involving , inter alia , implementation of integrated programmes in the beneficiary countries , strengthening its field offices , and the coordination effort undertaken to enhance cohesion between United Nations agencies as well as coherent action at local level by public and private agents involved in joint projects .  
Accordingly , the Executive Committee agreed to entrust their regional managers with the effective monitoring of CCAs and UNDAFs in their respective regions and to task them proactively to provide the necessary support to their country representatives , to contribute to and use the results of the CCA / UNDAF Learning Network on a systematic basis and to continue their joint inter-agency meetings and reports to the Executive Committee either on a quarterly or a biannual basis .  
The UNDG has set up a working group , chaired by UNFPA , with the objective of developing a common process for programme approval , taking into consideration the need for further harmonization and simplification of programmes and programming procedures for all United Nations organizations in the UNDG in order to provide the basis for a substantive , timely and joint oversight function of the respective Executive Boards .  
Three major issues have emerged from the workshops and consultations held and the feedback from country teams that have been involved in consultations with the World Bank as well as from the joint learning group on the CDF and PRSPs , which meets periodically and maintains continual electronic contact among its members : ( a ) enhancing national ownership of processes ; ( b ) improving participation of different actors , particularly civil society ; and ( c ) ensuring a substantive contribution of UNDP and the other United Nations agencies and entities .  
The Ministerial Council then reviewed the outcome of the meetings of a number of ministerial and technical committees held for the purpose of promoting joint action as well as the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The action taken in response to that trend included the following : renewed support for law enforcement authorities in combating synthetic drugs ; the establishment of joint agency units ; specialist training for customs and police officials ; increased support for demand reduction programmes directed against ATS ; and further strengthening of treaties of mutual legal assistance to ensure successful investigation and prosecution of those engaged in such criminal activity .  
She outlined a number of initiatives under way : at global management meetings , human resources issues were always on the agenda ; an Intranet site on staff morale had been established , which encouraged free and open dialogue ; the services of ombudspersons were being used to a greater extent ; and joint workshops for programme and operations staff were being held .  
On the basis of the Pact and goals of the League of Arab States , in an atmosphere of mutual understanding , brotherhood and sincerity , the leaders studied the state of the Nation , the challenges confronting it and the situation in the region and took a comprehensive inventory of regional and international circumstances , focusing on promoting Arab solidarity , reactivating the institutions of joint Arab endeavour , upholding the interests and rights of the Nation and maintaining Arab national security .  
The leaders attach special importance to the subject of Arab economic integration and are establishing measures to promote this aspect of joint Arab action so as to achieve a link between shared interests and mutual benefits , as well as strengthen the economic capabilities of their States by adopting an Arab plan that will enable the achievement of full sustainable development and increase joint economic action through positive interaction with the realities of the global economy and the phenomenon of globalization .  
In view of the increasing functions assigned to the technical body in the General Secretariat , they entrust the Secretary-General , together with the Economic and Social Council , with the task of supporting and developing that body with a view to triggering the Arab mechanisms and institutions responsible for following up joint Arab economic action .  
As summarized by the joint statement of the Co-Chairmen at the conclusion of the second substantive session of the Committee , it is obvious that international private flows can make important contributions to development , and that foreign direct investment can be an effective instrument to help fill the savings / investment gap in many developing countries and countries with economies in transition .  
In Economic and Social Council resolution 2000 / 35 , the Council decided to invite executive heads of relevant organizations of the United Nations system and heads of other relevant international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments to form a collaborative partnership on forests to support the work of UNFF and to enhance cooperation and coordination among participants , and facilitate and promote coordinated and cooperative action , including joint programming .  
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
This happened in the case of Venezuela and Mexico , which appear to have developed a subsequent practice , the examination of which could help specify or clarify the content and scope of the unilateral commitment assumed by those countries in relation to the Central American countries through a joint communiqu which could be considered a unilateral act of collective origin . 
The resolution establishes a consultative committee composed of experts from public , joint and private sectors and of civil society and from research centres involved with scientific and technological development in member countries .  
As development thinking shifts towards sustainable human development and parallel good governance and economic development , South-South initiatives are required to move easily from technical collaboration to joint efforts in social and economic development .  
In implementation of the instructions of the leaders of the GCC States framed with a view to promoting joint action to achieve the aspirations of the peoples of the region and strengthen security and stability , the Ministerial Council reviewed the outcome of the meetings of the ministerial and technical committees and the major developments that had taken place in connection with political issues and events at the regional , inter-Arab and international levels .  
The Meeting adopted a document entitled Framework for cooperation in peace-building ( S / 2001 / 138 , annex I ) , in which the United Nations and regional organizations agreed on guiding principles for cooperation in this field as well as on possible cooperative activities , such as establishing peace-building units , sending joint assessment missions to the field , developing repertories of best practices and lessons learned and the joint holding of pledging conferences .  
Within the framework of the memorandum of understanding between ECO and the United Nations Population Fund , five joint activities have taken place , the last being a conference held at Istanbul in May 2000 on expanding contraceptive choice and improving quality of reproductive health programmes .  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
Attention should also be paid to the joint implementation of projects ; such an approach was not only useful from the environmental standpoint but would also foster cooperation between the industrialized and developing countries , and between large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises , which was important for the transfer of technology and acceptance of international standards on management and production quality .  
Recognizing also the need to integrate and coordinate the endeavours of all the parties concerned with the development of scientific and technological capabilities , including bodies from the public , joint and private sectors and the institutions of civil society , to employ technological innovation in order to promote the productivity and competitiveness of the production and services sectors in member countries of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia ,  
The Government of Burkina Faso feels that the positive effects of globalization should be more equitably distributed among nations and that joint efforts should be made to overcome its negative effects , for if globalization were to favour only a minority of States it would be illusory and could lead to future conflicts between rich and poor nations .  
The principal objectives of the Network are to expand mutual support , cooperation and joint activities , including through information exchanges , training and development , undertaking joint projects , sharing expertise , periodical regional meetings and seminars , and mutually assisting each other with respect to requests from other national institutions regarding human rights violations .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list in the light of additional information that may become available for the purposes of identifying items that are covered under the relevant provisions of that resolution , because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
With regard to other multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , it is advised that the smaller core panel of experts should work closely with the respective subsidiary scientific bodies of MEAs , in particular with the Climate Change and Biodiversity conventions , in identifying concrete items for the joint programmes of work .  
The Assembly made a number of recommendations to Governments and Member States , in particular to countries of origin and destination , calling on them to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States .  
We must pledge today in a joint , coordinated and concerted way , and for the medium and long term as is expected of this Organization , to fulfil our moral , legal and political obligation to construct , for ourselves and for future generations , a legacy of democracy , freedom , peace and security .  
Mr . Kerim ( the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ) : Pleading for concerted action against international terrorism and for States urgent accession to all relevant international conventions , the Millennium Summit of world leaders anticipated the need for a more effective and comprehensive approach with regard to joint efforts and overall cooperation within the United Nations system .  
As far as the Macedonian contribution to the joint action in combating terrorism is concerned , my Government decided to prepare draft legislation on combating terrorism and to amend already existing legislation in this area , in order to comply with relevant regional and international conventions and other decisions of the United Nations , thus acting in compliance with the provisions of Security Council resolution 1373 ( 2001 ) .  
Collaboration on issues of children affected by armed conflict that are relevant to the special session on children has been extensive and fruitful : the draft outcome document of the special session , on a world fit for children , contains important recommendations for the agenda on children affected by armed conflict , many joint events were convened during the sessions of the Preparatory Committee , and several significant joint initiatives were planned for the special session itself .  
The commitment expressed by my country to the process of construction of the Euro-Mediterranean space , undertaken six years ago , is based strongly on its deep conviction that only joint and concerted action can consolidate stability and security in this region , and from that , to lay down , within the framework of a global approach , the basis of solidarity and cooperation based on the community of interests and a mutually advantageous partnership .  
Faced with dwindling ODA , as indicated in paragraph 17 above , and bearing in mind the need to bridge the infrastructure gap ( illustrated in table 3 ) , landlocked developing countries , in keeping with global trends , have been increasingly attracted by new modes of partnership between the public and the private sectors in the development of public infrastructure , such as contracting out or management contracts , private financing of public facilities , leasing , joint ventures , build-operate-transfer ( BOT ) schemes and privatization or capitalization .  
On 16 November of this year , heads of State and Government are expected to sign the Almaty Act , the final document of this regional forum , which reflects major aspects of cooperation : joint activities to combat new threats , including terrorism , separatism , extremism , illegal drugs and weapon trafficking ; a regional mechanism for the elaboration and application of confidence-building mechanisms in their broader meaning ; the institutionalization of the CICA , its structure , Secretariat , regular and specialized meetings , and academic and professional inputs .  
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
The International Labour Organization ( ILO ) maintained close cooperation with the League of Arab States and particularly with its specialized agency , the Arab Labour Organization ( ALO ) , by conducting joint activities and coordinating work pertaining to issues of common interest to both organizations .  With a view to strengthening cooperation with the League of Arab States , the two organizations signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2000 , with respect to employment in the occupied Palestinian territory .  
Urges concerned Governments , in particular those of the countries of origin and destination , to strengthen further their national efforts to protect and promote the rights and welfare of women migrant workers , including through sustained bilateral , regional , interregional and international cooperation , by developing strategies and joint action and taking into account the innovative approaches and experiences of individual Member States , and to establish and maintain continuing dialogues to facilitate the exchange of information ;  
Recognize the primary role to be played by the private sector in the exercise of economic , social and cultural rights , and call for joint action with Governments and civil society ;  
The agreed strategies and actions include developing a joint policy framework , improving data access and pricing , increasing effective research and development , evaluating and reforming education and skills formation strategies , and developing domestic and global markets .  
The road ahead remains long and difficult , however , and all of us , by virtue of our joint responsibility , must stand in firm support of that country until it has established peace , security and stability and its people are able to enjoy the economic and social prosperity and decent life of which they have been deprived for over 10 years and which they deserve , like all other peoples of the international family .  
Two technical reports on the assessments of national experiences on the enforcement of competition law and their dissemination to interested countries , with a view to sharing experiences and expertise among participating countries , identifying areas of mutual interests for further cooperation or for joint interventions ; Preparation of a training manual on common law base competition policy , containing eight modules for use by trainers in individual countries and the organization of national training workshops for government officials on modalities for the implementation of national competition and consumer protection legislation ;  
Reiterates the importance of joint efforts in pursuing the established goals of the Programme of Action by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , greater involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , availability of financial resources , and ensuring international cooperation and support in the spirit of solidarity and burden-sharing ;
