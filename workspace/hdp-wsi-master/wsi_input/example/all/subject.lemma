Other selections are made in accordance with certain international activities such as the " International Year of the Child " , and still another criteria for selection are important current events .  
Because many overseas Chinese have resided abroad for an extended period and may not be familiar with the laws and regulations governing fixed assets , the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has established the Hong Kong Chinese Relocation Bureau to facilitate and ensure the security of housing purchases . In addition , the United World Chinese Commercial Bank has set up a special Overseas Chinese Service Bureau to handle exclusively the purchase of property by overseas Chinese and furnish materials on the subject .  
Although a realist photographer , he avoids letting the realist elements become intrusive and disorderly , and strives for clean geometrical lines and juxtaposed layers of light and tone . Within the simple structures he creates , he attempts to manifest fully the mood of the subject .  
Comparing his black and white with his color photographs , the former appear more cohesive , and more poignant . His color works often emphasize atmosphere , tone , and composition at the expense of the subject . Creating balance among these various elements is , needless to say , a difficult task .  
Two centuries of adaptation and hard work combined with changing political and economic factors have made " the smooth integration of the Chinese into the multicultural society of Hawaii one of the rare success stories in the history of world immigration , " as Professor Clarence E . Glick of the University of Hawaii , noted for his research on the subject , has put it .  
A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
My main subject has always been the history of Buddhism in China and how it was changed by Chinese culture . I have also studied the history of the coming of Christianity to China during the late Ming and early Ch'ing , including how China received and transformed the influence and the Chinese reaction to it , such as the Taiping rebellion . That is the process that interests me most .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
If a local can under-take recording and explanatory fieldwork in advance it helps give a better insight into the subject , and the lack of obstacles to communication and understanding makes it easier for him to organize scattered and fragmentary materials and so arrive at more meaningful and detailed results . " This is how Wang Sung-shan , currently a research assistant at the National Science Museum , regards Ch'en Chien-ming 's role vis-a-vis other workers in the field .  
Despite the presence of its own ban on exploiting Chinese labor , the Manchu government of the Ch'ing dynasty was powerless to enforce it . In 1859 the Anglo-French Expeditionary Force attacked Peking , sacked the Yuan-ming-yuan and forced the Ch'ing government to sign the Treaty of Peking . One of its clauses stated : " . . . Any Chinese subject desirous of taking up employment anywhere under British jurisdiction or elsewhere abroad may contract with a British subject to do so . . . "  
Remarkably , retailers are falling over themselves to cut prices for items such as compact discs , furniture , home appliances , automobiles and antiques , none of which are subject to seasonal fluctuations . And prices for gold , real estate and land , normally much sought after as a hedge against inflation , have not only failed to rise rapidly , some are actually falling at an astonishing rate .  
Craftsmen have traditionally been held in low regard in Chinese society , but by dint of devotion to his calling and the artistry of his work Li has frequented the doors of the rich and famous and been treated on an equal footing by the powerful and elite . He has his own ideas on the subject .  
The " Civil Service Performance Review Law " which has just passed its third reading in the Legislative Yuan is sending a little " red envelope " to all government employees in time for the new year : The content of the civil service performance review bonus has been changed from " base pay " to " full pay . " This will almost double the original amount , making civil servants ' wallets once again a subject of after-dinner discussion .  
In the first year after it was founded , the Yangshan foundation held lectures and workshops on aboriginal culture , and on the theory and practice of field research . It set up a biennial prize of NT $ 200,000 for persons who have made outstanding contributions to Ilan politically , environmentally , culturally or otherwise , and it offered grants to master 's and doctoral candidates using Ilan as the subject of their dissertations . "  
Applying mental reasoning Chang Shih-tsung is adept at finding lateral links between things , using supporting material and coming up with new deductions . Starting from a rapid-fire " chopstick gun " invented by Taiwanese kids , he began to collect toy weapons from other countries and investigate their construction and performance . From our own history he found a rapid-fire crossbow from the Three Kingdoms Period , and has written a short paper on the subject .  
" These 18 ob jects serve as a pretty good representation of Ming art from both inside the imperial court and out , " says National Palace Museum Vice Director Chang Lin-sheng . The Emperor Hsiao-tzung of the Ming Dynasty , for instance , with its subject 's kindly , refined expression and its harmoniously matching background , is a work of great historical value and a masterpiece of the imperial academy .  
Kuh reveals with a smile that Dr . Tien used to " hold forth at length " with " laudable courage . " As his verbal skills steadily improved , he was able to bring the dry subject of mechanical engineering to life in class and cut straight to the point in conferences .  
Apart from sheer indulgence in the pleasure of painting , art also came to be moulded by a love of searching out the inner essence of things . Flower and bird painting entered the main stream of Northern Sung painting , and apart from pursuing detailed and accurate outer description it came to place even more emphasis on expression of the inner being of the subject . Lin Po-ting thinks that the portrayal of descriptive reality was just not enough for the Sung painters .  
Lin Shan-le , who came to Taiwan to live with relatives , and Li Lan , a student at Hsinpu Junior College , praise " 800O miles " for its deep and fertile subject matter and for daring to tackle sensitive issues . That lover of dramas Ma Yu , on the other hand , believes that " 8000 Miles " goes too far in directly judging mainland trends and cross-strait relations . Sometimes , she says , it has a sneering or glibly debasing tone that makes it more difficult for her to accept .  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
By the same token , those people who hope that the government can start political discussions on this subject with the Chinese Communists as soon as possible are apt to be accused of demeaning themselves and strengthening the enemy 's hand , while those who propose ignoring the Chinese Communists and appealing directly for international support are accused of wishful thinking and blindness to reality , or of opportunistically seeking Taiwanese independence . . . .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .  
Taking this theme a step farther , Chu Chia-hua 's cloth of abundantly colorful flowers and dried roses uses common objects to show the consumer manipulation people are subject to in modern urban life , where the flow of information is unchecked .  
If the subject is limited to manufacturing technology , then Taiwan companies have no huge advantage . Fortunately technology is just one element in commercial competition . Mainland manufacturers still offer too few styles , and use outdated materials . They are not like Taiwan firms , which can afford to bring in superior , more durable materials from abroad .  
His prizewinning work , entitled " Farewell to the Spring and Autumn Pavilion , " looks like an old photograph from the 1970s . The youthful subject , wearing a navy uniform and carrying a guitar , appears to be posing before a scenic backcloth in a photographic studio .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
The works of Taiwanese artists who studied at the Tokyo Fine Arts College at that time were subject to the stylistic influences of the impressionist school of the West . Combined with the independent , cordial nature of the Taiwanese people , this influence resulted in the fervent , uninhibited brush strokes displayed in Wang Yue-chih 's paintings of Peking 's scenery and people , and in his bold use of bright colors , which exude the tropical heat of a southern home town .  
Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet . No text book explains to children that raising dogs requires a number of conditions , including sufficient space and a responsible commitment to the dog .  
In recent years , about a tenth of NTNU graduates have decided to forego teaching ( a decision which means they have had to repay the government for their educations , which are paid for by the state ) . " You hear more and more stories about teachers being subject to physical intimidation , and you can feel that the professional respect for teachers has declined . Yet we have always been told that education is a noble profession . It really gets confusing , " is how one NTNU student puts it .  
It is especially ironic that Yang Guifei , the woman whose beauty , legend has it , caused the downfall of the Tang dynasty , was plump and sturdy , with pendulous breasts and a wide bottom . And in a famous painting of the Goddess Diana bathing which hangs in the Louvre , one can not help but notice that the subject has rather pronounced buttocks .  
To implement conservation work , one subject must be selected as a first objective . The environmentalist community can deliberate for a lifetime , but the disappearance of animal species from the natural world is like a raging fire , and we must quickly throw the fire alarm . In the midst of all the rush , errors naturally occur . People should learn from mistakes and move ever closer to the ideal .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
A large quantity of related products have one after the other become hot items in the marketplace . More than a few products which have nothing to do with the subject have been decorated with irrelevant " EQs . " Experts and famous public figures have been frequently invited to discuss the merits of EQ on TV and radio , and to speak at meetings and activities , exhibiting " feats of EQ . " As a matter of course , the " EQ fad " has swept into the realm of children 's education .  
After the head is drawn , the portrait master will need to add a long robe or a suit for the men , a Chinese or Western dress for the ladies . Sometimes , at the request of the client , a gold necklace or ring is added , the subject is made to sit at a formal chair associated with seniority , a vase with flowers is placed beside him or her , or scenes typical of an upper status Chinese family are arranged by the portrait master 's brush .  
According to his study of the subject , the patterns on Damascus swords are the natural crystal patterns formed when steel is cast , and those on Japanese swords are lines of temper color left by partial quenching of the blades . But the patterns on Chinese hundred-beaten steel are the grain patterns which result from repeated folding and hammering of the metal .  
Not only impressionable schoolchildren were confused : from the many views expressed in street gossip on the subject , it was apparent that even in the adult world there was a sudden crisis of confidence in the distinction between " good " and " evil . "  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Shunza 's music is classic US black music , ranging from rock and jazz to R &amp; B . A style that Taiwan 's female singers have rarely tried in the past has taken the market by storm , and her musical style and moving voice have been the subject of intense discussion on the Internet .  
Sandee Chen , who has been performing for three years , mainly has used her personal life as the subject of her songs before . Her latest album which came out last year , " Before a Bad Person Becomes Bad , " had an urban folk style and clearly expressed her views on society-satirizing the paparazzi , commemorating Peng Wan-ju , complaining about the refuse collection regulations and reflecting on the Chen Chin-hsing incident .  
Other possible symptoms include feelings of alienation , emotional withdrawal and a loss of interest in life . Some victims become hypersensitive , anxious , insomniac , unable to focus their attention and subject to memory lapses . Those who have lost a loved one or who themselves survived a disaster are particularly prone to feeling guilty about their own survival when others died .  
Wu Yii-feng emphasizes that the most unique characteristic of a documentary film is the relationship established between the film maker and the subject . " It 's unavoidable that the camera will be an intrusion . The key thing is whether or not this intrusion is uncomfortable to people , or whether or not that which is captured on film was staged deliberately . "  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired . " More class time is spent explaining English than teaching subject matter , " says Professor Chi Hsi-sheng of HKUST 's Division of Social Science .  
Bridging the ancient and the modern Having painted ladies of the Han and Tang dynasties , Lee Su Yue then traveled back to the present , treating images of women more familiar to her . She uses light ink to sparsely sketch their fine appearances , with distant moods to transmit the different character of each subject .  
What concrete suggestions could be applied to future Koo-Wang talks ? This question is the subject of the third and last part of this paper . At present , the ROC National Reunification Guidelines provide the guiding principles in facing pressure from Communist China . Although they are not perfect , if their basic spirit is grasped , and they are flexibly used , I believe they can best serve the national interest of our country .  
Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
For instance , Chen Chih-hsiang , a judge in the criminal division of the Taipei District Court , has petitioned for three constitutional interpretations : one on whether third-time drug abuse offenders should be subject to mandatory life imprisonment or death ; another on whether the scope for compensation under the Regulations on Applications for the Restitution of Citizens ' Rights Violated Under Martial Law was too narrowly defined and the requirements for documentary evidence too rigorous ; and a third on whether mandatory life imprisonment or death for drug traffickers was unconstitutional .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Playboy 's Lolita Hu notes that given its power to reach larger and wider audiences , the television medium is subject to greater restriction than magazines . Consequently , Taiwan 's TV programs are still unsure how to present comprehensive attitudes toward the body . Meanwhile , the permissible degree of bodily exposure is similarly narrower , at most merely reflecting trends in society .  
His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
This is the background against which the expansive and ambitious literary style of the Han took shape . Writers wrote with the elegance of a Chu poem and the sophistry of a diplomat . In tackling a subject , they endeavored to integrate virtually every possibility and use every relevant term . Their writing reflected the grandiose Zeitgeist of the Han Empire , and became the major form of Han literature .  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
Her opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and Chiung Yao 's series departed too far from reality . This in fact has been a chronic problem of Taiwan 's dramatic serials . " Love succeeded largely because it wedded realism to Taiwanese subject matter .  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
In 1979 , the famous singer of Hunan drama and member of the Central Music and Dance Company , Li Guyi , adopted Teng 's soft , breathy singing style to make the charming romantic ballad " Hometown Love . " This broke the long-term monopoly of using only folk or classical voice styles . Although the effort was subject to considerable official criticism , it was also widely popular .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art . The people motif , on the other hand , is about the commonplace . " To deal with the subject of tai ji quan takes boldness and vigor , while sculpting people requires great attention to detail and very good technical skill .  
The year before last , the United Nations nominated over 20 ecologically important areas worldwide as biosphere reserves , to be the subject of major conservation efforts with the support of the international community . But although East Asia was recognized as one of the regions of greatest biodiversity , a lack of detailed species lists and ecological background data prevented many areas being listed .  
The first leg of reform ( " changing opera " ) included a ban on traditional operatic works that dealt in any way with frightening murders , superstitious beliefs in ghosts or spirits , or sexually risque subject matter .  
In the advisory report issued in 1998 by the Executive Yuan 's Education Reform Committee , there is no sign of the words " integrated curriculum . " However , the committee members agreed that existing subject divisions were too narrow , and that children mostly studied fragmentary , disjointed knowledge completely divorced from their life experience . Thus " course integration " was an obvious orientation for change .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
While greenhouse gases are perceived to be one of the major causes of global warming , climate is subject to a number of complex influences , including levels of solar radiation , evaporation of seawater and airflows between different latitudes . On a short-term , regional level , topography , bodies of water and even air pollution and the volume of airborne particles influence climate . Therefore , establishing the precise impact of greenhouse gases on climate is no easy task .  
Located in a tropical climatic zone , Orchid Island is subject to great heat and violent typhoons . As a result , most of their settlements face the sea with their backs to the mountains . The gentle slopes along the coast are dotted with the Tao 's cave-like dwellings , which are warm in the winter and cool in the summer .  
When Wang Yeh circulated through the narrow lanes and alleyways of the town , doors were sealed and lights were extinguished in all houses along the route . The only illumination came from the lanterns of the inspection party . The songcaoren ritual for expelling evil , conducted just before the end of the inspection tour , was even more fearsome . Many legends surround bad things that happened to people who did n't get out of the way in time and were subject to the same terrifying forces that were called up to deal with demons .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
In a 3D scene , the virtual lens can be moved up or down and can observe the animation subject from any angle . But the subject itself can only rotate about its own axis or be observed by the camera revolving around it , or pass through the scene in midair . For instance , a twisting and turning high-speed flight through a dense jungle or along a narrow valley , with a ball of fire following close behind , is a typical 3D special effect .  
In The Archaeology of Knowledge , French scholar Michel Foucault observes that as medicine has developed from diagnosis by visual inspection , auscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests , its information system has been modified ; and how beside the physician there have appeared masses of data , instruments and analytical techniques which of course he uses , but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient .  
The first specialist pharmacological work to record lingzhi was the ancient Chinese pharmacopoeia Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing ( " Shen Nong 's Herbal " ) , believed to date from the 1st century BCE . It distinguishes six kinds of lingzhi : red , orange , blue , purple , white and black . Today , over 100 species of lingzhi are known , and they are the subject of intensive pharmaceutical research in many countries .  
Everyone is connected to their family and the caring between two generations is natural . The givers now will one day receive . This kind of filial piety , which is built around basic feelings of human nature , is not exclusive to Chinese society . Yeh Kuang-hui , who is still researching the topic of filial piety , has lots of friends doing research on this subject in the United States and Australia .  
Art critic Wang Chia-chi points out that Installation Art in Taiwan is basically written from the creative perspective of the artist , expressing both sympathy and empathy for the subject matter covered . As such , when Yao explains works , he strives to fathom the original creative intent of each artist . In consequence , the book has some commentary but is bereft of any clear , forceful critiques .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
Of course , the war was not in the least affected by the protest . But it is gratifying that on this subject at least there was a broad consensus among local feminist organizations , returning to the basic starting points of the women 's movement : love , peace , justice , and human rights . Perhaps it is by returning to basic humane values that the women 's movement in Taiwan will enjoy a resurgence .  
Looking at distant Chiufen through the rain in a room redolent of asphalt , one ca n't help but remember one 's own excitement and curiosity as a child upon seeing road workers spreading asphalt . These numerous asphalt paintings with their nostalgic subject matter bring one back , led by the smell , falling deep into thoughts about the truths and meaning of life .  
What 's more , criminal gangs began to control many of the venues , and related incidents were the subject of frequent unflattering press reports . Because of an underworld disagreement , gang leader Yang Shuang-wu shot and injured singer Kao Ling-feng at one such establishment in Kaohsiung . The incident shocked Taiwan , and many started to view these places as dens of iniquity . Attendance fell markedly .  
Thrilling as stories of epic heroism may be , there is a subject even more worth pondering : How is it that the combative and courageous Bunun are so respectful and gentle in dealing with the other living things that share their mountain surroundings ?  
For a work like No Holding Back , with the trio sculpted completely in the round , the posture and attitude of the three figures was a huge compositional challenge . In each stroke of the knife , there was little room for error . Every single angle had to be taken into consideration . Although the subject of the work was a traditional story , the piece nevertheless had a distinctly modern feel to it .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago . Although it reduced ten subjects to seven major disciplines , the core subjects of mathematics , Chinese and English remained clearly delineated in the classroom .  
As for questions raised by women 's groups , Shih Chao-hui , who also supports the pro-life position , acknowledges that facing up to the " realities " of abortion may indeed seem like a cruel thing to subject audiences to . And yet , she asks , are not modern terms such as " genetic health , " " termination of pregnancy , " and " induced abortion " simply linguistic traps designed to beautify the act of abortion ? A true view of the body  
Teachers are also very concerned about the possibility of lowered academic competence on the part of their students , given the fact that the increasingly diversified subject matter of the new integrated curriculum takes away from time spent on basic subjects .  
The Secrets of Fashion 's editors set out to produce a marketable book , and the editing of the text , the book 's layout and design , and the subject matter all reflect this , giving the book a style that is simultaneously classic and hip . Every chapter abounds in photographs that run the gamut from classical to contemporary and Chinese to international , yet there is nothing haphazard about the presentation .  
The rational use of pharmaceutical preparations containing narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances is a subject that is usually included in the curriculum of national educational institutions for health-care professionals .  
Certain women who are subject to physical or sexual violence by their drugusing partners or parents may none the less feel responsible for caring for their families or may be without alternative means of livelihood for economic , social or cultural reasons .  
One representative recommended that , when dealing with international cooperation on judicial matters , the Commission should bear in mind the various statements reflecting changing international legal thinking on the subject .  
However , it was pointed out that as a result of the increased demand for " cartographic products " , governmentfunded national surveys had a bright future , subject to good leadership , adaptation to technological advances and increased financial selfreliance .  
The joint UNDPOPS working group on this subject recognized that establishment of UNOPS as a separate and identifiable entity can not be accomplished without some changes also to Regulations relevant to the operational activities of UNOPS .  
The Advisory Committee was informed , upon inquiry , that UNAMIR posts have not been classified , since the posts established for peacekeeping operations are considered to be of temporary duration and thus not subject to the existing classification procedures .  
It was recognized that further deliberations on this complex and critical subject would require a set of wellpaced consultations , both formal and informal , over the period leading up to the establishment of the framework at the annual session 1995 .  
( iv ) The years of his contributory service in excess of 35 and performed as from 1 July 1995 , by 1 per cent of his final average remuneration , subject to a maximum total accumulation rate of 70 per cent . "  
( iii ) The years of his contributory service in excess of 35 and performed as from 1 July 1995 , by 1 per cent of his final average remuneration , subject to a maximum total accumulation rate of 70 per cent . "  
The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .

The four main areas identified by the Committee at its first general discussion , namely the adequacy of international standards , the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , their effective protection , as well as their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration were addressed in the study , and were the subject of specific recommendations by Ms . Machel .  
At its forty-ninth session , the General Assembly decided to appropriate , on an exceptional basis , $ 4,473,000 under section 21 on the understanding that the posts requested by the Secretary-General for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , the Centre for Human Rights and the human rights presence in Cambodia had been approved on a temporary basis and that all posts would be subject to a detailed review by the Advisory Committee and the Assembly at the earliest opportunity at the resumed forty-ninth session .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
Subject to those qualifications , his delegation supported the gist of the draft articles , in particular the dual criteria of " systematic " and " large - scale " for the crimes covered by articles 18 and 20 , the two separate jurisdictional regimes established in article 8 , and an exclusive regime for the crime of aggression ( article 16 ) subject to a limited exception of the national jurisdiction of a State committing aggression against its nationals .  
Mr . ECONOMIDES ( Greece ) said that , from the legal standpoint , one could question the wisdom of establishing a dual regime whereby crimes of aggression - far and away the most serious crime in relations between States - would be tried by an international criminal court , while the other four crimes included in the draft Code would be subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of national courts and an international criminal court .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
On the subject of Afro-Colombian communities , Act No . 70 of 1993 reaffirmed the political , economic , social , cultural and territorial rights of such groups and protected their lifestyle as a development option based on their own logic and experience , in conditions of equality , equity , autonomy , participation and respect for cultural differences . 
On the question of dress , the Special Rapporteur , while emphasizing that traditions and customs , irrespective of their origins , are equally worthy of respect , urges that dress should not be the subject of political regulation and calls for flexible and tolerant attitudes in this regard , so as to allow the variety and richness of Sudanese garments to manifest themselves without constraint .  
On the subject of protection of the individual , the Special Rapporteur earnestly hopes that restrictions on the freedom of movement of religious officials will be lifted and that the campaigns of harassment and intimidation directed against them , which are also prejudicial to their followers , will cease , thus enabling the Muslim brotherhoods to realize their full potential without fear , constraint or self-censorship , subject , of course , to respect for public order and the law and the avoidance of violence , extremism and obscurantism .  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .  
Turning to the subject of the Commission 's long-term programme of work , she said that her delegation attached most importance to the items relating to unilateral acts of States , criteria for the recognition of States , Governments and territorial acquisitions , the law of the environment and the law of the sea , the last-mentioned being an area in which Portugal had shown a strong interest .  Her delegation welcomed the proposal to carry out a preliminary study on the ownership and protection of wrecks beyond the limits of national maritime jurisdiction .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session ;  
HARRIS ( United States of America ) said that article 3 posed the greatest conceptual difficulties of all the draft articles , because it was always difficult to express the relationship between a new comprehensive agreement and existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on a particular subject .  
In August 1993 , it approved a proposal presented by SAMCOMM , following a meeting of riparian States in Bucharest , that vessels , both powered or non-powered , which carried no goods or commodities , excluding packing material intended for reuse ( empty reels , pallets , etc . ) , could transit without specific prior authorization of the Committee , provided that all movements were notified to the SAMs teams by shipping operators and that the vessels were subject to monitoring before entry to and exit from the Danube portion between Vidin / Calafat and Mohacs .  
It was paradoxical that those States which were the most vocal critics of the developing countries ' record on human rights were silent upon the subject of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The status of associate experts is clearly defined : they are staff members at the junior professional level , subject to the provisions of the Charter and Staff Regulations ; they can not seek or accept instructions concerning the performance of their duties from any Government , including their own , or from any authority outside the Organization ; conditions of service are specified in a letter of appointment , under the 200 series of the Staff Rules for technical assistance project personnel , on a fixed-term appointment , generally for a period not exceeding four years .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
As is now the case for permanent appointments , the career track appointments would be subject to termination for abolition of post , reduction of staff , on health grounds , for failure to meet the requisite level of performance and for disciplinary reasons . 10 With respect to performance , the new performance appraisal system will allow for a full annual review which would render redundant the review now conducted at the end of the first five years of service under a permanent appointment . 
A subject of utmost concern to the Special Committee was the Israeli decision to open an archaeological tunnel beneath the Temple Mount , which had been viewed as a grave provocation by Muslims throughout the world and had sparked the worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians since the beginning of the peace process , in which the Israeli army had responded with excessive force and incursions into the self-rule areas under exclusive Palestinian control .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session " ;  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
In fact , the concept is embedded in the FAO Constitution , Article VII , paragraph 3 , which states : " In appointing the staff , the Director-General shall , subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and technical competence , pay due regard to the importance of selecting personnel recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible " .  NULLA member State 's representation is determined directly by its contribution to the regular budget .  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law . 
All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
Requests the Secretary-General , in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , to include in his report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in 1997 proposals for the clearer identification of priority needs and the formulation of a coherent humanitarian strategy within consolidated appeals , and to ensure that consolidated appeals are formulated in a manner consistent with the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , and requests the Secretary-General to invite States to submit their views on this subject in due time ;  
Noting that many of the persistent organic pollutants identified in Governing Council decision 18 / 32 are currently subject to the voluntary prior informed consent procedure as laid down in the Amended London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ,  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
The Australian Government \ x { e5b8 } policy on the Middle East is based on long-standing and firmly established principles a fundamental commitment to Israel \ x { e5b8 } right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination acknowledging that the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity , including the possibility of an independent State , is subject to the final status negotiations between the parties directly involved .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
Against the background of the continued occurrence of crimes of aggression and grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws , all subject to punishment , the United Nations has remained either silent or incapable of taking necessary and practical measures .  
The Ministers asserted that the establishment of truly cooperative relations between regional parties in the Middle East was subject to complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land , and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights , in order that a climate of peace , security and stability could prevail in the region .  
Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
The Begeer report assumed that the existing international statistical system , which is decentralized in both the subject and regional dimensions , would continue unchanged , an assumption that is critical to its recommendations .  
As to the decentralized nature of the international statistical system in terms of subject , member States should be able to take a holistic view across all subject areas of the international statistical system , which at the moment is not possible because there are no mechanisms or processes in place for doing so ; the Commission itself does not have a broad enough reach and the individual components of the international statistical system are quite heterogeneous . 
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
In the light of various publications in the media and elsewhere concerning Israel 's interrogation policies and practices , I should be grateful if you could arrange to have the attached paper * on the subject ( prepared by the Ministry of Justice ) distributed as an official document of the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , before its opening on 10 March 1997 . 
The working group initially identified the principles that might be the relevant and maybe subject of future discussion , with a view to establishing a clear linkage between these principles and structural adjustment programmes as they impinged on economic , social and cultural rights .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
The deliveries to Armenia of military equipment and spare parts for them , which were unauthorized by the Government of the Russian Federation , have provoked a negative response on the part of a number of Russian officials and have become the subject of special deliberations in the State Duma of the Russian Federation , which has instructed its main committees - on defence , security , and CIS and ties with fellow citizens - to conduct a thorough investigation .  
He agreed that periodic reviews of the Model Law would be desirable because of the particular nature of the subject matter and the rapid technical changes that could be expected ; for that same reason it would also be useful for the current text to be described as the " 1996 version " of the Model Law .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
In particular , such provisions could invite States , in accordance with or subject to their domestic laws or pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements : ( a ) to take all appropriate measures to prevent preparation in their respective territories for the commission of those offences outside their territories ; ( b ) to exchange information in accordance with their national law ; and ( c ) to coordinate administrative and other measures to be taken , as appropriate , to prevent the commission of offences set forth in the convention .  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to investigate reported policies or activities which support , condone , encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children , separate children from their families and social backgrounds , forcibly round up children from the streets , or which subject children to forced internment , indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and to terminate immediately any such policies or activities and bring to trial any persons suspected of supporting or participating in them ;  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
Consequently , and as a next step in its further consideration of the subject , the Sub _ Commission may wish to address _ in the context of the simultaneous interest of these issues for human rights _ the United Nations and other international and regional efforts towards the control of terrorism , as well as measures undertaken at national level , based on information available from all sources .  
Thus the topic will be limited only to codification of secondary rules on the subject : while addressing the requirement of a violation of an international obligation of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of those international legal obligations , whether under customary or treaty law .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
In the light of the agreement reached in the informal consultations of the President on this subject , the Board decided , in accordance with paragraph 107 ( a ) of the Midrand final document , that it would scrutinize the UNCTAD publications policy at its sixteenth executive session , following prior consultations . 
Likewise , the categorized list contains certain items the export of which to Iraq must be notified to the joint unit established by Security Council resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) as these items will be subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian or for prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant resolutions .  
The position of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was that the above-mentioned expert groups continued to exist in the framework of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD , that their juridical identity was different to that of the expert meetings provided for in paragraph 114 of the Midrand final document , and that they were not subject to the agreed limit on the annual establishment of a maximum of 10 expert meetings by the Boards Commissions .  
In the light of the agreement reached in the informal consultations of the President on this subject , the Board decided , in accordance with paragraph 107 ( a ) of the Midrand final document , that it would scrutinize the UNCTAD publications policy at its sixteenth executive session , following prior consultations . 
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .  
I would point out that the Turkish occupied area of Cyprus contains a large part of the island 's archaeological and historic sites , as well as religious monuments , which are subject to severe and extensive destruction , of which Turkey , as the occupying Power , is fully responsible and accountable .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .  
The discussions will be videotaped and the taped footage will be utilized to produce a one-hour course on international law which will be distributed , subject to financial constraints , to schools , universities , research institutions , parliamentarians and foreign ministries to promote both knowledge and understanding of international law and international relations .  
In the light of the foregoing considerations and taking into account the dynamics and political importance of the subject , we have decided to instruct our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to maintain a broad dialogue on the issue , taking into account the regional interest , and to seek an understanding on the subject .  
It was unfortunate that a few countries refused to acknowledge that the issue had been settled once and for all by resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , and that the General Committee was subjected every year to the same repetitious and wasteful debate on the subject , despite the universally accepted principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State duly recognized as such by the United Nations . 
With respect to ITC , it was agreed to recommend to the responsible intergovernmental organs that present arrangements governing the status of ITC as a joint body be confirmed and renewed with WTO subject to revised budgetary arrangements as called for by the General Council of WTO .  
However , a hasty prohibition of landmines not accompanied by measures to strengthen stability , could have a negative impact , including on anti-terrorist activities .  The proper forum for the discussion of the subject of landmines is the Conference on Disarmament , where it is possible to carry out an in-depth study and discussion of the entire set of respective problems , including from the standpoint of their impact on the strengthening the security of interested States and international security in general .  
To recognize the ethnic and cultural existence of Argentine indigenous peoples ; to guarantee respect for identity and the right to bilingual and cross-cultural education ; to recognize the legal personality of indigenous communities and community ownership of the land they traditionally occupy ; to establish regulations for the handing over of other land that is suitable and sufficient for human development , none such land being inalienable , transmissible or subject to taxes or charges ; and to guarantee their participation in the management of their natural resources and other matters of interest to them .  
In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .  
The coastal State is also given the exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the construction , operation and use of artificial islands.a * The legal status of offshore installations , the legislation applicable to workers thereon , the type of jurisdiction exercised by States over such installations and the possible obligations arising from licensing of the installation for the purposes of exploration and exploitation continue to be of concern to ILO , and work begun on this subject has not yet been completed . 
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .  
The Secretary-General proposed to convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
His delegation also endorsed the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of the report that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Furthermore , on the subject of human rights , our countries have also gone through a difficult and often painful process in their transition to democracy and in the quest for fundamental human rights , a process that resulted in sad and tragic episodes but also taught valuable lessons that can and should be shared with other parts of the world .  
While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
Despite the fact that two of three agenda items were in the initial stages of discussions , the working groups on those two items have laid a solid foundation for their future work , and the interim documents compiled on subject issues reveal a serious intention on the part of delegations to elaborate comprehensive and practical recommendations .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
At its second regular session of 1982 , the Council decided to identify , at its annual organizational session , a subject related to interregional cooperation , of common interest to all regions , for detailed consideration under the agenda item on regional cooperation .  
In the report on this subject prepared two years ago for the Commission for Social Development , it was emphasized that , in a period of rapid change , it was particularly difficult to identify significant trends and distinguish transient from lasting changes affecting society .  
The series fills a real gap in the human rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
Beginning in October 1996 , the Act has been the subject of an energetic explanatory and awareness _ raising campaign directed at all sectors of the Rwandan population : the administration and the public , urban and rural sectors , judicial and prison personnel and detainees .  
The international community as a whole has taken a stand on this subject , in a virtually consensual manner , in endorsing the objective of a total ban on anti _ personnel mines by a very large majority with no negative votes in United Nations General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 L . As you know , France supported that text . 
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
In order to cut the main links between the insurgent groups and the civilian population , SLORC has forced entire communities living in the border area between Myanmar and Thailand to move to relocation sites which are subject to tight military control .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1996 / 112 of 23 April 1996 , decided to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on that subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , to include in his report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in 1997 proposals for the clearer identification of priority needs and the formulation of a coherent humanitarian strategy within consolidated appeals , and to ensure that consolidated appeals are formulated in a manner consistent with the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , and also requests the Secretary-General to invite States to submit their views on this subject in due time ;  
Among the principles underlying the current methodology for calculating equitable geographical distribution are broad agreements regarding the desirability of relating the base figure to the actual number of posts subject to geographical distribution ; the inclusion of posts based on the population factor in the ranges allocated to Member States ; and the need for flexibility upwards and downwards from the mid-point of each Member State 's range .  
These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
The representative of the United Kingdom found the original proposal of the representative of South Africa for a new article W acceptable to his delegation , because it maintained the status quo ( i.e . funding of human rights defenders being subject to national legislation consistent with applicable international law ) .  
The fact that a power company of Taiwan Province of China could attempt to export radioactive waste to a country where appropriate facilities are lacking , without being subject to any existing international regulatory mechanism , clearly testifies to the need to strengthen the current international regime controlling the transboundary movement of radioactive waste .  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to investigate reported policies or activities which support , condone , encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children , separate children from their families and social backgrounds , forcibly round up children from the streets , or which subject children to forced internment , indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and to terminate immediately any such policies or activities and bring to trial any persons suspected of supporting or participating in them ;  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model for electoral processes equally suited to all nations and their peoples , and that political systems and electoral processes are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
At its 67th meeting , on 16 April 1997 , the Commission decided , without a vote , to retain on its agenda item 10 ( a ) , entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , and to give it due priority at its fifty _ fourth session , it being understood that action required by previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary _ General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation .  
On the subject of human rights violations committed on the orders or with the sanction of Governments , it must be borne in mind that the term Government in this context is used not in the narrow sense , to designate the highest executive organ ( the council of ministers , cabinet or suchlike ) , but the entire system of State bodies , particularly legislative and executive , and the associated officials , since it is they who are most often the instigators when violations of human rights occur .  
On the subject of refugee status being granted to women fleeing female genital mutilation as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in her final report , note should be taken with satisfaction of the initiative taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in September 1996 when it assembled the representatives of 16 Western countries in Geneva to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for awarding refugee status to the problems specific to women and which differ from the generally recognized forms of political persecution .  
This approach would make it possible to eliminate several sources of violations of economic , social and cultural rights ; ( b ) Violations of economic , social and cultural rights could be declared international crimes that are consequently subject to the principles of universal jurisdiction and imprescriptibility , so that they can be punished at any time and in any place .  
Noting that foreign migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
I would like to refer to my announcement to the Security Council on 8 July 1997 that I intended to appoint an investigative team in order to investigate alleged grave violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the Democratic Republic of the Congo committed since 1 March 1993 , and to the briefing the Council received on the subject on 30 July .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
In its second Advisory Opinion , the Inter-American Court stated that the ' essential ' judicial guarantees that are not subject to derogation according to article 27 include habeas corpus , amparo , and any other effective remedy before judges or competent tribunals which is designed to guarantee respect for the rights and freedoms whose suspension are not authorized by the American Convention .  
For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
Such adverse effects may occur not only whenever specific postal material is the subject of sanctions , but also when air traffic to a sanctioned State is interrupted or suspended .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
After giving statistical data on the subject , she mentioned some of the forms of discrimination that women faced when accessing the job market , including unequal access to training and retraining and to credit and other productive resources , and low participation in economic decision-making and in collective bargaining structures .  
At the resumed fiftieth session of the General Assembly , the question of public administration and development had been considered , with a high level of representation and participation ; it was regrettable that the resolution adopted on the subject reflected only partially the valuable ideas and suggestions presented by delegations . 
At the 770th plenary meeting on 26 June 1997 , the delegation of Germany , drawing on earlier statements of several representatives of other Member States , proposed the reestablishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the prohibition of the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of the report of the Special Coordinator on this subject and the mandate contained therein ( CD / 1299 ) . 
Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings subject to the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 24 .  
Although such measures may be imposed not only by individual States , but also by a group of States , the determination or judgement of alleged wrongful or objectionable policies of target States subject to coercive economic measures is made by sender State ( s ) largely on a unilateral or narrow-group basis .  
At that Summit they decided on the challenges of development in Latin America in the coming years and identified the main urban problems that will be the subject of future joint activity .  
Looking forward to when we come to the practical realization of the ultimate goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons , multilateral negotiations on an international agreement on the subject will obviously also become essential .  
The unlawful acts committed in respect of all materials or items covered by the current draft also include unlawful acts committed in respect of nuclear material in peaceful use the subject matter covered by the Physical Protection Convention .  
We are very close to agreement as regards agenda item 1 , although we remain profoundly disturbed by the lack of any reference _ however fleeting _ to fissile material cut _ off , a subject of earlier consensus in this Conference .  
They are located in fragile ecosystems and have been subject to strong degradation for many years , owing to environmental stress ( arid climate , poor soils , strong erosion , overgrazing and demographic expansion ) .  
In adopting its agreed conclusions on the subject in 1995 , the Council took a major step forward by providing a coherent set of guidelines for developing a coordinated response to this global agenda at the intergovernmental as well as the inter-agency level .  
Due to their size , most of these Territories are not endowed with natural resources and are subject to regular natural disasters , global warming , desalination of water sources , dependency on few commodities and a high level of emigration .  
The girl child was added as the twelfth critical area during the preparatory process , as a result of regional preparations and of pressure to recognize that true progress could be realized only if the next generation was also the subject of special attention .  
The AG13 , having considered a proposal from the Chairman , decided to adopt the framework of the multilateral consultative process , set out in annex II below , subject to the matters contained in square brackets in its paragraphs 8 and 9 .  
While welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction , Mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons , which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms .  
But it was also necessary to cast a critical eye on the regulations applied in the global market , which was subject to far less rigorous supervision than that exercised by the national mechanisms of stable , developed economic systems .  
A document entitled Education for a viable future in the Americas is being prepared , which reflects international thinking on the subject , following the meeting on that theme organized by UNESCO in Thessaloniki , Greece , in December 1997 .  
The basic curriculum , pursuant to which the subject curriculum for pre-university education is under elaboration , is based on fundamental principles regarding general human , social and cultural values .  
It is Japans fundamental view that the primary objective of any effort to codify a multilateral treaty on State responsibility is to provide an effective legal framework for the resolution of international disputes on that subject .  
Concerning external debt , the agreed formulations on problems relating to debt workouts by countries hit by financial crisis and on the slow progress in the implementation of the World Bank / IMF HIPC initiative represented a significant advance in international consensus on the subject .  
Article 6 was deemed to provide an important clarification ; indeed it was stated that , while the Commissions work on a comprehensive set of articles on prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities deserved full support , other rules and developments in that area of international law should be admitted , and it was important not to make premature commitments concerning the subject .  
In this regard it may be necessary to develop a separate set of verification methods and procedures that will enhance international confidence that fissile material subject to control is not returned to nuclear _ weapons programmes , while at the same time ensuring that the inspectors do not gain access to classified information .  
We note that the grave problems associated with small arms and light weapons are being discussed elsewhere through intensive and praiseworthy efforts of which Brazil is supportive and that a comprehensive consideration of this issue will be the subject of an international conference to take place no later than 2001 .  
Since certain of the subject matters included in the model curriculum as well as the other guidance will become dated in the long term and other subjects and information may need to be added to enable professional accountants to function in a rapidly changing global environment , the model curriculum should be modified as appropriate .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
Reiterates the importance of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action which reaffirms the right to development , as established by the Declaration on the Right to Development , as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights and also reaffirms that the human person is the central subject of development ;  
There is an impressive amount of expert knowledge and diplomatic skills concentrated in this room , and time and again our deliberations , which approach the subject matter from different , even opposing , viewpoints , have produced new and valuable insights and helped to clarify and develop national positions in no insignificant way .  
If it is generally accepted that Special Coordinators are an effective mechanism to develop common understanding , why do we not give the CD President discretionary powers to nominate a Special Coordinator with a simple standard mandate , when he needs help in the search for common ground on how to proceed on a particular subject in the CD ? 
We fully agree with the Norwegian State Secretary when she said last week that excess material that is removed from the military production cycle should no longer have the status of military non _ verifiable material , but gradually be made subject to a transparent , non _ military and civilian regime subject to international verification .  
Table 2 : OHCHR staff members in the Professional and above category , by nationality , grade and gender , falling under the following categories , as of 31 December 1998 : ( i ) temporary staff in the Professional and above categories holding appointments of less than one year ( not subject to geographical distribution ) ; ( ii ) staff employed as technical cooperation personnel ; and ( iii ) staff specifically appointed for mission service .  
Finally , in instances of losses due to fraud , which is regarded as a gross violation of the standards of integrity expected of an international civil servant , the staff member may be summarily dismissed if the misconduct is patent , or may be subject to other disciplinary action , in addition to the Organizations efforts to obtain full recovery of the fraudulently misappropriated funds . 
The Government of the United States of America was of the view that the World Conference can make a major contribution to the understanding of racial questions and pave the way for an international dialogue on the subject in coming decades ; its approach should therefore be future _ oriented and constructive . 
the substantive discussion of nuclear disarmament issues through which the international community can be better informed on a continuing basis , can express its views as to the process , and can identify issues which might be subject to multilateral negotiations .  
Further recommends , subject to the decision of the Assembly on its establishment , that the work of the committee be based on thematic analytical reports of the Secretary-General of the United Nations that would be prepared with the active involvement of all relevant parts of the United Nations Secretariat , and in close collaboration with relevant international organizations and agencies within and outside the United Nations system .  
Each State Party shall ensure that , subject to relevant domestic legislation of the State Party , the said legal entity may incur criminal , civil or administrative liability and is subject to effective measures taken as a result of such liability .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .  
Implementation of feasible measures to detect or monitor the physical cross-border transport of cash and bearer negotiable instruments , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information and without impeding in any way the freedom of capital movements .

The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
Regrettably , in view of the complexity of the subject and the diversity of views on some contentious issues , the preparatory committee has not been able to finalize its work on the main substantive document for the special session , and has decided to recommend that the General Assembly at its fifty-third session authorize the Commission on Population and Development acting as the preparatory committee to hold a resumed session for four days in May or June 1999 in order to complete its work .  
In some common law jurisdictions , arbitrators may enjoy a high level of immunity more akin to a judge , while in others a distinction is drawn between those acts of an arbitrator which are adjudicatory , and thus entitled to this high standard of immunity , and those acts which are unrelated to any adjudicatory function and thus subject to civil liability .  
The main principles agreed upon at that time were that international law , including the Charter of the United Nations , would be applicable to outer space and celestial bodies , and that outer space and celestial bodies were free for exploration and use by all States in conformity with international law and were not subject to national appropriation .  
It provides that the Moon and other celestial bodies are not subject to national appropriation and are to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes , that the environments of those bodies should not be disrupted or contaminated by space activities and that the United Nations should be informed of the location and purpose of any station established on those bodies .  
At its fifty-fourth session , the Commission on Human Rights decided to retain on its agenda the sub-item entitled Question of human rights in Cyprus , it being understood that action required pursuant to previous resolutions of the Commission on the subject would continue to remain operative , including the request to the Secretary-General to provide a report to the Commission regarding their implementation ( decision 1998 / 109 ) .  
The FRY Constitution stipulates that property is inviolable and that no one may be deprived of his property , nor may it be restricted , except when so required by the public interest , as determined by law , subject to fair remuneration which may not be below its market value ( art . 69 , paras . 2 and 3 ) .  
Since certain of the subject matters included in the model curriculum as well as the other guidance will become dated in the long term and other subjects and information may need to be added to enable professional accountants to function in a rapidly changing global environment , the model curriculum should be modified as appropriate .  
Contrary to the textbook model of large numbers of investors making careful independent judgements as to profitable opportunities , the capital markets are subject to bouts of herd behaviour that is , investors follow one another without forming their own judgements or expectations about individual economies .  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
The extensive policy and substantive exchanges that took place on such issues as regional and subregional trade arrangements , " growth triangles " and special economic and free-trade zones led to the adoption of the Bali Declaration and a Plan of Action on this urgent , complex subject .  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
In view of the fact that these areas were subject to a slower form of deterioration , it was determined that , rather than add them to the existing garage project , the areas ( north end 2B ) should be designed and bid as a separate project and the benefit of further competitive bidding gained ; ( iv ) Library faade ( $ 250,000 ) .  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
There is , therefore , a need for the Council to consider arrangements to allow additional funding through either bilateral or multilateral sources , over and above those made under the programme , still subject to existing financial controls established by relevant decisions of the Council .  
Requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of funds from the regular budget or extrabudgetary resources , to arrange for additional meetings to be scheduled for negotiation of the protocols , with a view to enhancing the potential for the expeditious and simultaneous completion of the convention against transnational organized crime and the protocols thereto ;  
The wording as it stood was unfortunate as it included no mention of compensation for expropriation , which in France was determined , after the administrative phase of the expropriation procedure had been carried out , in special court proceedings and subject to constitutional constraints whereby the judge was the guarantor of respect for private property rights .  
The courts in a number of civil law States had ruled that any such agreement must be subject to domestic administrative law , and one of the practical consequences of that ruling was that Governments were unwilling to agree to submit disputes to arbitration , since the law itself provided specific remedies , penalties and rights .  
While developing countries that have received large foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other capital inflows have achieved high growth , they have also been subject to extreme downside risks of volatile capital movements .  
The Council may also wish to recommend that the executive boards of the funds and programmes consider the subject of further progress to achieving common premises and shared services , possibly at upcoming joint session of the boards , and consider a practical joint programme of action , including appropriate cost-sharing and adequate financing .  
When a State declares an indigenous territory as protected area , any lands , territories and resources under potential or actual claim by indigenous peoples , conservation areas shall not be subject to any natural resource development without the informed consent and participation of the peoples concerned .  
Tour operators , schools , and permanent missions calling to request tours or briefings can now be handled more efficiently ; speaker and subject availability for groups is more easily determined ; special ticket promotions can be tracked ; less time is spent generating routine monthly reports and reports responding to specific requests .  
The CANZ delegations would have expected any questions surrounding such material amounts to have been settled and appropriate adjustments made to the financial statements before the accounts were submitted to Member States : the problem of unliquidated obligations was not new , had been the subject of critical comment by the Board of Auditors and the Advisory Committee in the past and had a direct impact on the funds due to Member States whether as troop contributors or as recipients of credits .  
Should the exigencies of the service permit , and subject to the prior approval of the Secretary-General , occasional compensatory time off may be granted to staff members serving at established offices in the Professional category who have been required to work substantial or recurrent periods of overtime .  
When the authorized mode of transportation is other than by sea , full travel subsistence allowance shall be payable for the time spent in transit , subject to the conditions laid down in rules 107.15 to 107.18 , and provided that , in the case of travel other than on official business , a maximum of three days ' travel time shall be allowed in respect of any specific journey .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
Suitable gratis personnel would be selected and accepted subject to the regime applicable to gratis personnel as established by the General Assembly and subsequent administrative issuances , including the conclusion of a standard agreement with donor countries .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
In its resolution , the Sub _ Commission agreed that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should be requested to send out a questionnaire to Governments , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations , inviting them to send all relevant national documentation on the subject of affirmative action .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list , in the light of additional information that may become available , for the purposes of identifying items that are subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
On a reciprocal basis , States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements or understandings whereby , in relation to matters that are the subject of criminal proceedings in one or more States , the judicial authorities concerned may , where necessary together with police authorities and after informing the central authority or authorities referred to in paragraph 8 of this article , act jointly within joint investigation bodies .  
While the issue of the protection of civilians in conflict will be the subject of a special report to the Security Council in September 1999 , the environment for timely humanitarian action in many countries continues to be compromised by deliberate targeting of civilians and humanitarian workers , ethnic cleansing , atrocities committed against children and denial of access to humanitarian assistance .  
All of this demonstrates that human rights have become a matter of international legal regulation and international protection , and the individual is considered to be a subject of international law with a clearly defined legal personality .  
In its resolution 1998 / 5 , the Sub _ Commission decided , since the subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept and practice of affirmative action , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .  
Grosso modo , the newcomers and their successors imbued ( and imbue ) the land with an essentially patrimonial value , making it subject to exclusive individual appropriation ( and , thus , capable of being passed on to others at the will of the title holder ) , a source of material wealth and a basis for political and economic power .  
They were also the subject of the working paper prepared for the fifth session by Mr . Mehedi , who concluded that such education must have two facets : on the one hand , preservation of collective identity accompanied by acceptance of diversity as an asset and , on the other hand , universal education leading to understanding and tolerance . 
If the primary injured subject changed from , e.g . , the individual to a State of which he is a national , this would affect the application of the rule of the exhaustion of local remedies insofar as it did not apply in the case of a composite wrongful act .  
While the Commission could not express an opinion , for example , on whether expropriation was a continuing or a completed wrongful act , it could emphasize the primacy of article 18 , so that acts that had been complete at a time when they had been lawful did not subsequently become the subject of contention because the law had changed .  
Article 27 , subparagraph ( b ) appeared to have excluded from its scope strictly bilateral treaty obligations in which State C was not bound by any rule contained in a treaty concluded between States A and B . On the other hand , as it currently stood , article 27 covered not only the case of obligations erga omnes but also rules of general international law to which both States were subject , such as rules on diplomatic relations , whether conventional or customary . 
Recognizing that they both take a substantive interest in areas of common concern and are committed to promoting a more comprehensive and relevant treatment of the subject matter while avoiding unproductive duplication and inconsistency of recommendations , the two Commissions have developed an elaborate coordinating mechanism .  
A number of functional commissions did not concur with proposals , contained , inter alia , in the 1998 consolidated report ( E / 1999 / 3 ) that certain topics , such as gender equality and human rights , should be addressed exclusively by the single functional commission which has the primary responsibility for the subject matter , in particular in the context of implementation and follow-up to a major conference .  
It is recognized that there is a vital link between national stability and economic and social development , and that the provision of adequate and sufficient assistance to Haiti is largely subject to a return to political stability .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
This provision has been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly as regards the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .  
According to article 8 of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages , which covers the subject in more detail , States have a choice between different types of obligation in relation to education of or in the regional or minority language , at the pre _ school , primary or secondary level , and where technical or professional , university and other forms of education are concerned .  
This provision has been the subject of controversy between federal States and non-federal States , particularly as regards the problem resulting from the potential dual capacity of constituent units to exercise governmental authority on behalf of the State or on their own behalf , pursuant to the distribution of public power between the State and its constituent units according to the relevant constitution .  
It was agreed to exclude from the study unilateral acts subject to special legal regimes such as , inter alia , those based on conventional law , reservations to treaties and declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .  
Noting that migrant workers are frequently subject to discriminatory rules and regulations which undermine their human dignity , including being forced to live separately from their spouses and their minor children , sometimes for extended periods , and that they are often victims of violence , racism and xenophobia ,  
The African continent is subject to a wide range of natural hazards , and suffers constantly from natural and other disasters , which have serious adverse effects on societies and national economies as well as on scarce human and material resources .  
Viewed from this perspective the FMT could capture in an irreversible way weapons material declared as excess in an ongoing process ; prevent altogether or regulate the further production of weapons _ grade materials for legitimate uses such as fuel for research reactors , naval reactors , etc . ; make closed _ down production and associated facilities subject to verification to prevent their reuse for weapons purposes .  
Recognizing that , owing to exceptional circumstances , Iraq was the subject of a unique sanctions regime established under chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the Board nevertheless stressed the importance of ridding Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction ; of Iraqs full compliance with relevant Security Council resolutions ; and the grave regional and international consequences of Iraqs persistent non-compliance .  
In order to preserve equivalent standards of living at different offices , the Secretary-General may adjust the basic salaries set forth in paragraphs 1 and 3 of the present annex by the application of non-pensionable post adjustments based on relative costs of living , standards of living and related factors at the office concerned as compared to New York . Such post adjustments shall not be subject to staff assessment .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
Replies received from Member States indicated that traditional and customary practices affecting the health of women and girls , in particular female genital mutilation , continued to be the subject of national action .  
Surely the subject deserved some mention , and some trifling consideration might have been given to the possibility of an effort to cleanse central and southern Iraq of the effects of this radioactive weapon , which is killing tens of thousands of Iraqi children every year and will continue to affect future generations as well .  
From traditional society to our modern world with its elaborate written laws , it has always been understood that persons who are not involved in combat during an armed conflict should not be subject to attack .  
In order to create and maintain such political will , it is important to give broad publicity to this issue by widely disseminating relevant information on the subject , including the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting and the pertinent resolutions of the General Assembly , and above all by publicizing the costs borne by a few countries in supporting the decisions of the Security Council adopted in the name of the international community as a whole .  
In Saudi Arabia , such freedom of movement appears to be restricted , even non-existent , given that a woman going abroad to study has to be accompanied by a family member , that women are prohibited from driving motor vehicles and that access to buses and public facilities is subject to segregation .

A : As to this question , I mentioned at a meeting of the Executive Yuan last week that I hoped the Government Information Office would use the mass media to make citizens aware that surplus funds should be directed toward proper investments rather than toward illegal investment channels , because illegal investments may be subject to large risks , and those risks and any future losses must be borne by the investors themselves : the government can not be responsible for any losses incurred in illegal activity .  
My main subject has always been the history of Buddhism in China and how it was changed by Chinese culture . I have also studied the history of the coming of Christianity to China during the late Ming and early Ch'ing , including how China received and transformed the influence and the Chinese reaction to it , such as the Taiping rebellion . That is the process that interests me most .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
If a local can under-take recording and explanatory fieldwork in advance it helps give a better insight into the subject , and the lack of obstacles to communication and understanding makes it easier for him to organize scattered and fragmentary materials and so arrive at more meaningful and detailed results . " This is how Wang Sung-shan , currently a research assistant at the National Science Museum , regards Ch'en Chien-ming 's role vis-a-vis other workers in the field .  
Despite the presence of its own ban on exploiting Chinese labor , the Manchu government of the Ch'ing dynasty was powerless to enforce it .

Any Chinese subject desirous of taking up employment anywhere under British jurisdiction or elsewhere abroad may contract with a British subject to do so . . . "

"  
Applying mental reasoning Chang Shih-tsung is adept at finding lateral links between things , using supporting material and coming up with new deductions . Starting from a rapid-fire " chopstick gun " invented by Taiwanese kids , he began to collect toy weapons from other countries and investigate their construction and performance . From our own history he found a rapid-fire crossbow from the Three Kingdoms Period , and has written a short paper on the subject .  
" These 18 ob jects serve as a pretty good representation of Ming art from both inside the imperial court and out , " says National Palace Museum Vice Director Chang Lin-sheng .

Apart from sheer indulgence in the pleasure of painting , art also came to be moulded by a love of searching out the inner essence of things . Flower and bird painting entered the main stream of Northern Sung painting , and apart from pursuing detailed and accurate outer description it came to place even more emphasis on expression of the inner being of the subject . Lin Po-ting thinks that the portrayal of descriptive reality was just not enough for the Sung painters .  
Lin Shan-le , who came to Taiwan to live with relatives , and Li Lan , a student at Hsinpu Junior College , praise " 800O miles " for its deep and fertile subject matter and for daring to tackle sensitive issues . That lover of dramas Ma Yu , on the other hand , believes that " 8000 Miles " goes too far in directly judging mainland trends and cross-strait relations . Sometimes , she says , it has a sneering or glibly debasing tone that makes it more difficult for her to accept .  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
By the same token , those people who hope that the government can start political discussions on this subject with the Chinese Communists as soon as possible are apt to be accused of demeaning themselves and strengthening the enemy 's hand , while those who propose ignoring the Chinese Communists and appealing directly for international support are accused of wishful thinking and blindness to reality , or of opportunistically seeking Taiwanese independence . . . .  
From national health insurance to basic and earnings-related state pensions for the elderly , the social welfare pie is growing ever larger . Scholars have differing views on the subject , and the average man in the street is increasingly confused .  
What a hot topic of conversation this has been over the ages ! One imaginative theory holds that dragons are bolts of lightning . As large numbers of dinosaur bones have been unearthed this century in China , views from a proper perspective of the more complete skeletons have given many a startling and eerie sense of recognition . If the Chinese painted the dragon based on an awe-inspiring subject and artists creatively enhanced their rendering of it , dinosaurs skeletons might just be what excited the imaginations of the ancient Chinese to depict dragons .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
Kinmen kaoliang , king of liquorsWhen it comes to the subject of what gifts to take back home , one is sure to think of Kinmen kaoliang . Since Kinmen 's state-owned distillery was obliged to stop selling its products directly to the public to avoid engaging in unfair competition with private enterprise , Kinmen 's pure , silky-smooth aged sorghum spirit has been in short supply , causing its price to rocket . In recent times especially , it has been hard to get hold of at any price .

His prizewinning work , entitled " Farewell to the Spring and Autumn Pavilion , " looks like an old photograph from the 1970s . The youthful subject , wearing a navy uniform and carrying a guitar , appears to be posing before a scenic backcloth in a photographic studio .  
As I stated above , she does n't have any advantages in her creative environment and subject matter . And she has failed to pursue an even higher quality of creative style , and her intellectual offspring are naturally less than ideal . Almost all the stories collected here are too brief , and the exposi tion of her plots and characters is too sketchy .  
The works of Taiwanese artists who studied at the Tokyo Fine Arts College at that time were subject to the stylistic influences of the impressionist school of the West . Combined with the independent , cordial nature of the Taiwanese people , this influence resulted in the fervent , uninhibited brush strokes displayed in Wang Yue-chih 's paintings of Peking 's scenery and people , and in his bold use of bright colors , which exude the tropical heat of a southern home town .  
Wang Yi-ju , the National Taiwan Normal University Institute of Environmental Education , who chose stray dogs as the subject for her master 's thesis , notes that none of Taiwan 's elementary school text books mention how to care for dogs , with the exception of a single essay by the writer Lin Liang on the warm feelings between him and his pet . No text book explains to children that raising dogs requires a number of conditions , including sufficient space and a responsible commitment to the dog .  
In recent years , about a tenth of NTNU graduates have decided to forego teaching ( a decision which means they have had to repay the government for their educations , which are paid for by the state ) . " You hear more and more stories about teachers being subject to physical intimidation , and you can feel that the professional respect for teachers has declined . Yet we have always been told that education is a noble profession . It really gets confusing , " is how one NTNU student puts it .  
It is especially ironic that Yang Guifei , the woman whose beauty , legend has it , caused the downfall of the Tang dynasty , was plump and sturdy , with pendulous breasts and a wide bottom . And in a famous painting of the Goddess Diana bathing which hangs in the Louvre , one can not help but notice that the subject has rather pronounced buttocks .  
To implement conservation work , one subject must be selected as a first objective . The environmentalist community can deliberate for a lifetime , but the disappearance of animal species from the natural world is like a raging fire , and we must quickly throw the fire alarm . In the midst of all the rush , errors naturally occur . People should learn from mistakes and move ever closer to the ideal .  
Some borrow movements from Chinese opera , while others search for characteristic Chinese body language in tai-chi or meditation . Others adapt the techniques of Western modern dance . One individual of the latter type of is Lin Huai-min . His Cloud Gate dance company is built on a foundation of techniques developed by American choreographer Martha Graham , with subject matter drawn from current events in Taiwan or from Chinese classics ( like Dream of the Red Chamber or The Legend of the White Snake ) .  
Speaking of his 40-year quest to recreate the wooden ox , Wang Jian comments : " I have loved mechanical toys ever since I was a child . When I learned the story of the wooden ox I began making one out of cardboard and wood . I began drawing designs at middle school , and continued thinking on the subject at university , where I read mechanical engineering . My main sources were " Making the Wooden Ox " from Zhuge Liang 's Collected Works , and the documentary records of Zu Chongzhi . "  
A large quantity of related products have one after the other become hot items in the marketplace . More than a few products which have nothing to do with the subject have been decorated with irrelevant " EQs . " Experts and famous public figures have been frequently invited to discuss the merits of EQ on TV and radio , and to speak at meetings and activities , exhibiting " feats of EQ . " As a matter of course , the " EQ fad " has swept into the realm of children 's education .  
After the head is drawn , the portrait master will need to add a long robe or a suit for the men , a Chinese or Western dress for the ladies . Sometimes , at the request of the client , a gold necklace or ring is added , the subject is made to sit at a formal chair associated with seniority , a vase with flowers is placed beside him or her , or scenes typical of an upper status Chinese family are arranged by the portrait master 's brush .  
According to his study of the subject , the patterns on Damascus swords are the natural crystal patterns formed when steel is cast , and those on Japanese swords are lines of temper color left by partial quenching of the blades . But the patterns on Chinese hundred-beaten steel are the grain patterns which result from repeated folding and hammering of the metal .  
Not only impressionable schoolchildren were confused : from the many views expressed in street gossip on the subject , it was apparent that even in the adult world there was a sudden crisis of confidence in the distinction between " good " and " evil . "  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Shunza 's music is classic US black music , ranging from rock and jazz to R &amp; B . A style that Taiwan 's female singers have rarely tried in the past has taken the market by storm , and her musical style and moving voice have been the subject of intense discussion on the Internet .  
Sandee Chen , who has been performing for three years , mainly has used her personal life as the subject of her songs before . Her latest album which came out last year , " Before a Bad Person Becomes Bad , " had an urban folk style and clearly expressed her views on society-satirizing the paparazzi , commemorating Peng Wan-ju , complaining about the refuse collection regulations and reflecting on the Chen Chin-hsing incident .  
Other possible symptoms include feelings of alienation , emotional withdrawal and a loss of interest in life . Some victims become hypersensitive , anxious , insomniac , unable to focus their attention and subject to memory lapses . Those who have lost a loved one or who themselves survived a disaster are particularly prone to feeling guilty about their own survival when others died .  
Wu Yii-feng emphasizes that the most unique characteristic of a documentary film is the relationship established between the film maker and the subject . " It 's unavoidable that the camera will be an intrusion . The key thing is whether or not this intrusion is uncomfortable to people , or whether or not that which is captured on film was staged deliberately . "  
Indeed , as far as he is concerned , " It seems like the film makers were all being ' politically correct , ' acting as if documentaries were only good for filming ' disadvantaged ' groups in society . These subjects and people inevitably become documentary material , and the film makers just use them because they make easy subject matter , " says Wang with sharp frankness .  
He met the subject of the piece , Li Jung-lin , nine years previously when Li handled the funeral of his mother . But it was only two years ago , when Lin 's mother 's grave was robbed , and Li , wearing a gas mask , personally went into the grave to repair the damage to the coffin , that Lin really came to understand this man . He discovered that Li has quite remarkable views on death , human dignity , and on the poor self-regulation of the funeral industry .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired .

What concrete suggestions could be applied to future Koo-Wang talks ? This question is the subject of the third and last part of this paper . At present , the ROC National Reunification Guidelines provide the guiding principles in facing pressure from Communist China . Although they are not perfect , if their basic spirit is grasped , and they are flexibly used , I believe they can best serve the national interest of our country .  
Today , the goal is to keep children from being affected by the two extremes of repressed desire or ignorant promiscuity , and to help them establish correct sexual attitudes as early as possible . Thus the Ministry of Education has begun to promote sex education in schools under the name of " sex and gender equality education . " It has been discussed and seminars have been held continually at schools at all levels . Sexual education has gone from being a taboo subject on campuses to being one of the most prominent aspects of educational reform .  
For instance , Chen Chih-hsiang , a judge in the criminal division of the Taipei District Court , has petitioned for three constitutional interpretations : one on whether third-time drug abuse offenders should be subject to mandatory life imprisonment or death ; another on whether the scope for compensation under the Regulations on Applications for the Restitution of Citizens ' Rights Violated Under Martial Law was too narrowly defined and the requirements for documentary evidence too rigorous ; and a third on whether mandatory life imprisonment or death for drug traffickers was unconstitutional .  
After Taiwan 's economic development shifted to industry and commerce and cities were constructed rapidly , problems of water resource management became more complex , demand for water increased , underground water sources were excessively tapped , hillside development was allowed where soil conservation should have been exercised , and industrial pollution increased steadily . The government 's attention to the subject of water resources never kept pace with the rate at which these problems developed .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Playboy 's Lolita Hu notes that given its power to reach larger and wider audiences , the television medium is subject to greater restriction than magazines . Consequently , Taiwan 's TV programs are still unsure how to present comprehensive attitudes toward the body . Meanwhile , the permissible degree of bodily exposure is similarly narrower , at most merely reflecting trends in society .  
His inspiration for bringing so many artists together came during a trip abroad when he happened to come across a museum exhibit in which all the items on display were modeled after Western chess pieces . The flat pieces used in Chinese chess , on the other hand , settled into their current abstract form during the Song dynasty , and have seldom been the subject of concrete artistic creation of this sort .  
This is the background against which the expansive and ambitious literary style of the Han took shape . Writers wrote with the elegance of a Chu poem and the sophistry of a diplomat . In tackling a subject , they endeavored to integrate virtually every possibility and use every relevant term . Their writing reflected the grandiose Zeitgeist of the Han Empire , and became the major form of Han literature .  
The programming for these time slots was low-budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in Taiwan 's unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters-in-law and the like , or family comedies . Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of being lowbrow .  
Her opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and Chiung Yao 's series departed too far from reality . This in fact has been a chronic problem of Taiwan 's dramatic serials . " Love succeeded largely because it wedded realism to Taiwanese subject matter .  
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , " mainland fever " plummeted , and nativist stories using the Taiwanese language once again saw their star rising . This time they went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 . Writer Lin Ling-ling used the White Terror as subject matter to write the second major nativist prime-time drama in Taiwan television history-Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh . It was so popular that its producer , Hsu Chin-liang , ended up making a trilogy around the same theme .  
In 1979 , the famous singer of Hunan drama and member of the Central Music and Dance Company , Li Guyi , adopted Teng 's soft , breathy singing style to make the charming romantic ballad " Hometown Love . " This broke the long-term monopoly of using only folk or classical voice styles . Although the effort was subject to considerable official criticism , it was also widely popular .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
According to Chang Sung-jen , an art critic who acts as Ju Ming 's agent , " Tai ji quan involves a force that is from beyond the realm of ordinary human experience , and art that focuses on this subject could very nearly be categorized as religious art .

As a result of the decentralization of activities and resources in the fields of natural resources and energy as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General of this subject ( see document A / C . 5 / 48 / 76 of 31 May 1994 ) , technical and professional posts were decentralized from the Department for Development Support and Management Services to the regional commissions in order to strengthen their ability to provide technical assistance and policy advice in the area of mineral resources at the regional level .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
We are addressing ourselves to you , Mr . Secretary-General , in the difficult and critical circumstances in which we find ourselves , in order to assure you once again that we reject and condemn the policy of blockade and closure being pursued by the Government of Israel and to convey to you our extreme displeasure and great concern at the dire consequences the blockade measures are having and at the ongoing closures that have been imposed by Israel on the entire Palestinian people in the areas subject to the Palestinian National Authority . 
The adoption of the 1988 Convention not only marked the first decisive step in mobilizing the international community in the fight against illicit drug trafficking , but also defined money-laundering offences and required parties to the Convention to proscribe them as serious criminal offences that would be severely punished and subject to extradition .  
47 The central theme in all the information provided by States on this subject is the need to further enhance international cooperation which , if integrated with national efforts , will form a comprehensive strategy against organized transnational crime .  
[ 140 ] / The short " excursion " into the field of substantive problems had been useful in order to shed more light on a subject generally considered to be very complex and sensitive as well as to realistically assess the prospects of different approaches in addressing specific problems . 
" The relevant provisions of General Assembly resolutions relating to common premises and services in the field should be further submitted by the specialized agencies to their respective governing bodies , which should provide more precise legislative authority to their secretariats on the subject of this report in fulfilment of their treaty obligations under the relationship agreements they have concluded and ratified with the United Nations . "  
The success of these policies will largely depend on political developments , but the availability of considerable IMF funding , subject to conditionality and close monitoring , may help to keep them on track , despite increasing popular protests against reforms in the run-up to the presidential elections in June . The projected growth rate for 1996 in the medium-term strategy is 2.3 per cent , but none of the variant forecasts made by the Ministry of the Economy , published in January , show positive GDP growth in 1996 .  
Society 's assigned roles and perceptions also play a part in the way men and women are involved in illicit trafficking ; are vulnerable to punitive actions from the law enforcement sectors ; are subject to human rights violations ; and are perceived in the community .  
Regarding the specific subject of national execution , the outstanding issue is still the need to formulate a clear and acceptable definition of the term " national execution " in order to prevent varying interpretations by individual United Nations agencies responsible for applying it .  
The importance of closer cooperation is recognized by all Governments , although some developing countries - while encouraging this development - are concerned that it might lead to new conditionalities and make operational activities within the United Nations system subject to the restrictive policies normally attached to loans .  
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
If two adjoining countries do not agree on a set of common rules on how goods passing through each other 's territory will be treated , then national law will prevail in each case , and a motor vehicle , for example , might be subject to multiple unnecessary inspections , might require different insurance coverage , might be subject to special license requirements , etc .  
While the global Secretariat relies on its existing staff to carry out its established work programme and implement the various mandates entrusted to it , it does occasionally experience the need for supplementing established staffing resources on a short-term basis to respond to specific mandates or requests from Member States , or to meet the demands of peak periods in areas subject to sharp and often unpredictable workload fluctuations .  
The defence motion was based on three arguments : the alleged unlawful establishment of the Tribunal ; alleged unjustified primacy over competent domestic courts ; and an alleged lack of subject matter jurisdiction under articles 2 , 3 and 5 of the statute .  
It was recognized that respect for the rights of the accused were fundamental and reflected the credibility of the Court and that there was already a large body of international law on the subject , as contained in such instruments as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners and the statutes of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda tribunals , which should be elaborated in the statute .  
As indicated in the March report , further vacancies are expected to be realized through full use of attrition in 1996-1997 ; strict enforcement of retirement age ; freeze in recruitment , subject to limited exceptions ; introduction of a programme for lateral redeployment of staff ; and , should these measures prove insufficient , the involuntary separation of staff .  
As stated in the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( see A / 50 / 361 , paras . 44-49 , despite several cases of application of Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations , in connection with sanctions against Southern Rhodesia , Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ( Serbia and Montenegro ) , there is no uniform and internationally recognized methodology for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of non-target States affected by the implementation of mandatory economic sanctions .  
Although no substantive intergovernmental or inter-agency discussion on the subject has yet taken place , the recent conceptual analyses and specific case studies have featured several basic principles or criteria for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of States arising from the implementation by them of sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , particularly in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
The list of functionally defined , transferable fields contained in the Schedule is not exhaustive ; however , transfer of legislative and executive powers in fields other than those listed in the Schedule is subject to prior agreement between the Home Rule Authority and the central authorities of the realm .  
Admission to general or vocational upper secondary education - which traditionally prepares students for higher education - is subject to a statement issued by their earlier school confirming that they are qualified for studies at this level .  
The effects on the mental and psychological health of children subject to commercial sexual exploitation are not easy to diagnose , and can be healed only through expensive and prolonged treatment .  
These populations can not be expected to return to their homes if the political systems and national laws to which they are subject fail to offer them reliable guarantees against summary executions , enforced disappearances , torture and unfair trials .  
The recommendation in paragraph 50 of the Committee 's report , to the effect that in future scales of assessment , all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum rate of 0.001 per cent , should be implemented as soon as possible .  
With regard to the minimum rate of assessment , Viet Nam supported the recommendation of the Committee on Contributions that in future scales of assessments all Member States whose share of adjusted national income was less than the current floor of 0.01 per cent should be assessed at their actual share of adjusted income , subject to a minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent , in order to reduce the number of developing countries affected .  
As explained in an earlier report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / C . 5 / 49 / 64 , para . 8 ) , the costs of staff representational activities and the staff-management consultative process can be identified as both direct costs against the regular budget and indirect costs in terms of the release of staff from their assigned programme duties .  
When engaged in a scientific activity abroad a researcher is subject to the " official mission " schedule , which accords him a privileged status and allowances which are dependent on his grade but , in any event , sufficient to cover the costs of his stay abroad and , if necessary , of registration fees and travel .  
Foreign proceeding means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding pursuant to a law relating to insolvency in a foreign State in which proceeding the asset and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court or other competent authority , for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation [ provided that the debts were not incurred predominantly for household or other personal rather than commercial purposes ] ;  
The series fills a real gap on the human-rights publications programme and has been designed to be composed of three parts : a short introduction to the subject under debate , a personal interview with the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the issue and an annex with a list of the major relevant documents and resolutions . 
His delegation supported the continuing decentralization of functions which , in particular , increased managerial responsibility at the local level , and agreed that delegated management authority must be accompanied by delegated financial authority , subject , however , to the overall authority of the Office of Human Resources Management . 
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
Under those definitions , a Member State was considered to be adequately represented if the number of its nationals employed in the Secretariat on posts subject to geographical distribution fell within the desirable range as defined by the General Assembly itself .  
The four main areas identified by the Committee at its first general discussion , namely the adequacy of international standards , the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , their effective protection , as well as their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration were addressed in the study , and were the subject of specific recommendations by Ms . Machel .  
At its forty-ninth session , the General Assembly decided to appropriate , on an exceptional basis , $ 4,473,000 under section 21 on the understanding that the posts requested by the Secretary-General for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , the Centre for Human Rights and the human rights presence in Cambodia had been approved on a temporary basis and that all posts would be subject to a detailed review by the Advisory Committee and the Assembly at the earliest opportunity at the resumed forty-ninth session .  
It endorsed the Secretary-General 's initiative to convene a Special Consultative Meeting of entities involved with the carriage of materials subject to the 1993 INF Code and the coastal States concerned for the purpose of sharing information , concerns and ideas and to gain a better understanding of the safety and environmental aspects involved .  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
Subject to those qualifications , his delegation supported the gist of the draft articles , in particular the dual criteria of " systematic " and " large - scale " for the crimes covered by articles 18 and 20 , the two separate jurisdictional regimes established in article 8 , and an exclusive regime for the crime of aggression ( article 16 ) subject to a limited exception of the national jurisdiction of a State committing aggression against its nationals .  
Mr . ECONOMIDES ( Greece ) said that , from the legal standpoint , one could question the wisdom of establishing a dual regime whereby crimes of aggression - far and away the most serious crime in relations between States - would be tried by an international criminal court , while the other four crimes included in the draft Code would be subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of national courts and an international criminal court .  
Overall , the Special Rapporteur urges all parties concerned , official and otherwise , national and foreign , to calm rather than exacerbate religious problems , thereby ensuring that religion is not subject to political intrusion and exploitation and that constants are not affected by political variables .  
On the subject of Afro-Colombian communities , Act No . 70 of 1993 reaffirmed the political , economic , social , cultural and territorial rights of such groups and protected their lifestyle as a development option based on their own logic and experience , in conditions of equality , equity , autonomy , participation and respect for cultural differences . 
On the question of dress , the Special Rapporteur , while emphasizing that traditions and customs , irrespective of their origins , are equally worthy of respect , urges that dress should not be the subject of political regulation and calls for flexible and tolerant attitudes in this regard , so as to allow the variety and richness of Sudanese garments to manifest themselves without constraint .  
On the subject of protection of the individual , the Special Rapporteur earnestly hopes that restrictions on the freedom of movement of religious officials will be lifted and that the campaigns of harassment and intimidation directed against them , which are also prejudicial to their followers , will cease , thus enabling the Muslim brotherhoods to realize their full potential without fear , constraint or self-censorship , subject , of course , to respect for public order and the law and the avoidance of violence , extremism and obscurantism .  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .  
Turning to the subject of the Commission 's long-term programme of work , she said that her delegation attached most importance to the items relating to unilateral acts of States , criteria for the recognition of States , Governments and territorial acquisitions , the law of the environment and the law of the sea , the last-mentioned being an area in which Portugal had shown a strong interest .  Her delegation welcomed the proposal to carry out a preliminary study on the ownership and protection of wrecks beyond the limits of national maritime jurisdiction .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session ;  
HARRIS ( United States of America ) said that article 3 posed the greatest conceptual difficulties of all the draft articles , because it was always difficult to express the relationship between a new comprehensive agreement and existing bilateral and multilateral agreements on a particular subject .  
In August 1993 , it approved a proposal presented by SAMCOMM , following a meeting of riparian States in Bucharest , that vessels , both powered or non-powered , which carried no goods or commodities , excluding packing material intended for reuse ( empty reels , pallets , etc . ) , could transit without specific prior authorization of the Committee , provided that all movements were notified to the SAMs teams by shipping operators and that the vessels were subject to monitoring before entry to and exit from the Danube portion between Vidin / Calafat and Mohacs .  
It was paradoxical that those States which were the most vocal critics of the developing countries ' record on human rights were silent upon the subject of economic , social and cultural rights .  
The status of associate experts is clearly defined : they are staff members at the junior professional level , subject to the provisions of the Charter and Staff Regulations ; they can not seek or accept instructions concerning the performance of their duties from any Government , including their own , or from any authority outside the Organization ; conditions of service are specified in a letter of appointment , under the 200 series of the Staff Rules for technical assistance project personnel , on a fixed-term appointment , generally for a period not exceeding four years .  
Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to requesting Member States , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
The following table and chart show the proportion of fixed-term appointments to career appointments , including permanent and probationary , for staff subject to equitable geographical distribution , over a six-year period . 8 It is noted that , as requested by the General Assembly in resolution 49 / 222 A , the Secretary-General has sustained the ratio between career and fixed-term appointments since 1994 , with minor variations . 
As is now the case for permanent appointments , the career track appointments would be subject to termination for abolition of post , reduction of staff , on health grounds , for failure to meet the requisite level of performance and for disciplinary reasons . 10 With respect to performance , the new performance appraisal system will allow for a full annual review which would render redundant the review now conducted at the end of the first five years of service under a permanent appointment . 
A subject of utmost concern to the Special Committee was the Israeli decision to open an archaeological tunnel beneath the Temple Mount , which had been viewed as a grave provocation by Muslims throughout the world and had sparked the worst fighting between Israelis and Palestinians since the beginning of the peace process , in which the Israeli army had responded with excessive force and incursions into the self-rule areas under exclusive Palestinian control .  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly Devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session " ;  
Decides , subject to the outcome of deliberations concerning the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament at the 1997 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , to convene a meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Fourth Special Session of the General Assembly devoted to Disarmament before the end of the fifty-first session of the Assembly in order to set an exact date and to decide on organizational matters relating to the convening of the special session , and to submit its progress report to the Assembly at its fifty-second session ;  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,  
In fact , the concept is embedded in the FAO Constitution , Article VII , paragraph 3 , which states : " In appointing the staff , the Director-General shall , subject to the paramount importance of securing the highest standards of efficiency and technical competence , pay due regard to the importance of selecting personnel recruitment on as wide a geographical basis as possible " .  NULLA member State 's representation is determined directly by its contribution to the regular budget .  
The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .  
When an aerospace object is located in the territorial airspace of another State , it may be subject to international air law as well as to relevant domestic air law by reason of national security or aerial safety as long as it has characteristics both of an aeroplane which is subject to air law and a space object which is subject to space law . 
All of these measures , adopted by consensus , must today constitute the foundation for actions to be undertaken at the national , regional and global levels to successfully fight this scourge , which remains a subject of major concern to the entire international community , as it is a flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of women and children in particular .  
It would appear that the views of the Inspectors in this report vary significantly from the conclusions and recommendations of two previous JIU reports on the subject of advancing the status of women , issued in June 19943 and October 1995.4 Both reports were fully supportive of the special measures introduced by the Secretary-General to improve the status of women in the Secretariat and called for increased accountability of programme managers , in particular those who did not demonstrate real efforts to improve the status and representation of women in their respective departments .  
As indicated in paragraph 12 of the Secretary-General 's report , the contingency fund , approved at 0.75 per cent of the overall level of resources for the first outline , has been maintained at that level for all subsequent ones ; it has always proved to be adequate to accommodate additional expenditures derived from legislative mandates not provided for in the proposed programme budget , as defined in resolutions 41 / 213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent resolutions on the subject . 
Requests the Secretary-General , in consultation with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , to include in his report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session in 1997 proposals for the clearer identification of priority needs and the formulation of a coherent humanitarian strategy within consolidated appeals , and to ensure that consolidated appeals are formulated in a manner consistent with the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , and requests the Secretary-General to invite States to submit their views on this subject in due time ;  
Noting that many of the persistent organic pollutants identified in Governing Council decision 18 / 32 are currently subject to the voluntary prior informed consent procedure as laid down in the Amended London Guidelines for the Exchange of Information on Chemicals in International Trade and the International Code of Conduct on the Distribution and Use of Pesticides of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ,  
At its meeting on this subject at its resumed fiftieth session , in April 1996 , the General Assembly addressed the following key concerns : political legitimacy ; freedom of association and participation ; a fair and reliable judiciary ; freedom of information and expression ; effective and efficient public sector management ; and interaction with organizations of civil society .  
The Australian Government \ x { e5b8 } policy on the Middle East is based on long-standing and firmly established principles a fundamental commitment to Israel \ x { e5b8 } right to exist within secure and recognized boundaries and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination acknowledging that the ultimate shape of the Palestinian entity , including the possibility of an independent State , is subject to the final status negotiations between the parties directly involved .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America is an integral development programme that focuses on the human being as the central and primary subject of development and gives priority to economic and social growth in our countries and to the protection and conservation of the ecosystem , as is evidenced by regional efforts in the areas of biodiversity , climate change and forests .  
Against the background of the continued occurrence of crimes of aggression and grave violations of human rights and humanitarian laws , all subject to punishment , the United Nations has remained either silent or incapable of taking necessary and practical measures .  
The Ministers asserted that the establishment of truly cooperative relations between regional parties in the Middle East was subject to complete Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab land , and the achievement by the Palestinian people of their legitimate national rights , in order that a climate of peace , security and stability could prevail in the region .  
Their export earnings were hit particularly hard by their specialization in semiconductors and types of computer equipment that have relatively low technological content and that were subject to more pronounced downward price pressures when demand fell .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .  
It is clear , therefore , that the legislative progress made at the federal level in connection with compensation for victims of offences has been suitably supplemented by federative entities , and it is to be hoped that , in the near future , all the necessary and relevant legal provisions on the subject will be in place , particularly in respect of acts committed by public servants .  
The Begeer report assumed that the existing international statistical system , which is decentralized in both the subject and regional dimensions , would continue unchanged , an assumption that is critical to its recommendations .  
As to the decentralized nature of the international statistical system in terms of subject , member States should be able to take a holistic view across all subject areas of the international statistical system , which at the moment is not possible because there are no mechanisms or processes in place for doing so ; the Commission itself does not have a broad enough reach and the individual components of the international statistical system are quite heterogeneous . 
Rounds of consultations are currently being held at the level of the Government and political parties on a new preliminary bill on the subject , with the aim of harmonizing the specifically military and social aspects to be included in the future law .  
In this respect , the Special Rapporteur recalls Commission resolutions 1994 / 79 , 1995 / 77 and 1996 / 73 , in which , inter alia , it called upon the Government to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with the instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoyed fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
The Conference sowed the seeds of a new form of cooperation between national institutions in Africa ; it met in the context of the tenth anniversary of the African Charter of Human and Peoples ' Rights and addressed a subject of vital importance for Africa , that of strengthening human rights mechanisms which can act as a buffer between the public authorities and civil society , which promote the process of democratization and guarantee the rule of law .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
In that resolution , the Council , convinced that the holding of a special session of the General Assembly devoted to the subject could make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the actions of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against that global threat , decided to recommend to the General Assembly to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities .  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
In the light of various publications in the media and elsewhere concerning Israel 's interrogation policies and practices , I should be grateful if you could arrange to have the attached paper * on the subject ( prepared by the Ministry of Justice ) distributed as an official document of the fifty _ third session of the Commission on Human Rights , before its opening on 10 March 1997 . 
The working group initially identified the principles that might be the relevant and maybe subject of future discussion , with a view to establishing a clear linkage between these principles and structural adjustment programmes as they impinged on economic , social and cultural rights .  
Another proposal was that a definition should be based on the elements of a certificate contained in the note by the Secretariat , which referred to the certificate as being an electronic record that listed a public key together with the name of the certificate subscriber as the subject of the certificate , and confirmed that the prospective signer identified in the certificate held the corresponding private key ( A / CN . 9 / WG.IV / WP . 71 , para .  36 ) .  
The deliveries to Armenia of military equipment and spare parts for them , which were unauthorized by the Government of the Russian Federation , have provoked a negative response on the part of a number of Russian officials and have become the subject of special deliberations in the State Duma of the Russian Federation , which has instructed its main committees - on defence , security , and CIS and ties with fellow citizens - to conduct a thorough investigation .  
He agreed that periodic reviews of the Model Law would be desirable because of the particular nature of the subject matter and the rapid technical changes that could be expected ; for that same reason it would also be useful for the current text to be described as the " 1996 version " of the Model Law .  
Mindful that in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ( A / CONF . 157 / 23 ) the World Conference on Human Rights reaffirmed the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of all fundamental human rights , reaffirmed that the human person was the central subject of development and underlined the need for a concerted effort to ensure recognition of economic , social and cultural rights at the national , regional and international levels ,  
Reaffirming that activities to improve public knowledge in the field of human rights are essential to the fulfilment of the principles and purposes of the United Nations set out in Article 1 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter of the United Nations , and that carefully designed programmes of teaching , education and information are essential to the achievement of lasting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , Recalling previous General Assembly and its own resolutions on this subject ,  
The continued preference of some of the warring Afghan parties for the military option , and their intransigence and lack of responsiveness to the strenuous efforts of the special representative to achieve a comprehensive settlement , confirm the need to develop the efforts currently being made by the United Nations and to direct these efforts to more practical steps leading to the creation of the climate necessary for the implementation of the proposals made to date and of the resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Security Council on this subject .  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
In particular , such provisions could invite States , in accordance with or subject to their domestic laws or pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements or arrangements : ( a ) to take all appropriate measures to prevent preparation in their respective territories for the commission of those offences outside their territories ; ( b ) to exchange information in accordance with their national law ; and ( c ) to coordinate administrative and other measures to be taken , as appropriate , to prevent the commission of offences set forth in the convention .  
Calls upon the Government of the Sudan to comply with applicable international human rights instruments and to bring its national legislation into accordance with those instruments to which the Sudan is a party , and to ensure that all individuals in its territory and subject to its jurisdiction , including members of all religious and ethnic groups , enjoy fully the rights recognized in those instruments ;  
Urges the Government of the Sudan to investigate reported policies or activities which support , condone , encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children , separate children from their families and social backgrounds , forcibly round up children from the streets , or which subject children to forced internment , indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and to terminate immediately any such policies or activities and bring to trial any persons suspected of supporting or participating in them ;  
In order to avoid military courts , in those countries where they have not yet been abolished , helping to perpetuate impunity by virtue of a lack of independence resulting from the chain of command to which all or some of their members are subject , their jurisdiction must be limited solely to specifically military offences committed by military personnel , excluding human rights violations constituting serious crimes under international law , which come under the jurisdiction of the ordinary domestic courts or , where necessary , an international court .  
Consequently , and as a next step in its further consideration of the subject , the Sub _ Commission may wish to address _ in the context of the simultaneous interest of these issues for human rights _ the United Nations and other international and regional efforts towards the control of terrorism , as well as measures undertaken at national level , based on information available from all sources .  
Thus the topic will be limited only to codification of secondary rules on the subject : while addressing the requirement of a violation of an international obligation of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of those international legal obligations , whether under customary or treaty law .  
The pace and orientation of institution-building in the public sector alone has been subject to the influence of a variety of factors which reflect the difficulties of isolating the development of effective PA institutions from the realities imposed by political exigencies , economic pressures and human resource limitations .  
In the light of the agreement reached in the informal consultations of the President on this subject , the Board decided , in accordance with paragraph 107 ( a ) of the Midrand final document , that it would scrutinize the UNCTAD publications policy at its sixteenth executive session , following prior consultations . 
Likewise , the categorized list contains certain items the export of which to Iraq must be notified to the joint unit established by Security Council resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) as these items will be subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian or for prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) and other relevant resolutions .  
The position of the Latin American and Caribbean Group was that the above-mentioned expert groups continued to exist in the framework of the intergovernmental machinery of UNCTAD , that their juridical identity was different to that of the expert meetings provided for in paragraph 114 of the Midrand final document , and that they were not subject to the agreed limit on the annual establishment of a maximum of 10 expert meetings by the Boards Commissions .  
In the light of the agreement reached in the informal consultations of the President on this subject , the Board decided , in accordance with paragraph 107 ( a ) of the Midrand final document , that it would scrutinize the UNCTAD publications policy at its sixteenth executive session , following prior consultations .

It is hypocritical that the Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations should level false accusations against the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus on the subject of protection of cultural heritage , when it is a well-known fact that Greece itself is engaged in a policy of forcible assimilation of the Turkish minority in western Thrace , coupled with systematic pillaging and obliteration of Turkish monuments .

In the light of the foregoing considerations and taking into account the dynamics and political importance of the subject , we have decided to instruct our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to maintain a broad dialogue on the issue , taking into account the regional interest , and to seek an understanding on the subject .  
It was unfortunate that a few countries refused to acknowledge that the issue had been settled once and for all by resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , and that the General Committee was subjected every year to the same repetitious and wasteful debate on the subject , despite the universally accepted principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State duly recognized as such by the United Nations .

However , a hasty prohibition of landmines not accompanied by measures to strengthen stability , could have a negative impact , including on anti-terrorist activities .

In view of the fact that conditions for its entry into force are not subject to revision , we have to consider seriously a set of measures to provide for the timely implementation of the Treaty , since it is not impossible that a technologically perfect , though expensive , CTBT verification system will be established and ready to function while the Treaty itself is still not operational .  
The coastal State is also given the exclusive right to construct and to authorize and regulate the construction , operation and use of artificial islands.a * The legal status of offshore installations , the legislation applicable to workers thereon , the type of jurisdiction exercised by States over such installations and the possible obligations arising from licensing of the installation for the purposes of exploration and exploitation continue to be of concern to ILO , and work begun on this subject has not yet been completed . 
Thus , the degree to which coastal States can enforce IMO regulations in respect of foreign ships in innocent passage in their territorial waters or navigating the exclusive economic zone is a subject matter to be established by national law drafted in accordance with the provisions of UNCLOS .

While acknowledging that the various working groups within the Organization were dealing with individual aspects of this problem , the sponsor noted that they were doing so in a context and manner which were primarily political and operational in nature , whereas the Special Committee , being a body with highly qualified legal expertise , was best suited for dealing with the mere legal aspects of the matter , which were the subject of the proposed declaration .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
Despite the fact that two of three agenda items were in the initial stages of discussions , the working groups on those two items have laid a solid foundation for their future work , and the interim documents compiled on subject issues reveal a serious intention on the part of delegations to elaborate comprehensive and practical recommendations .  
While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
Among the measures taken by the Israeli authorities are the allocation of huge funds to change the basic features of Jerusalem and to erase its Arab character and the promulgation of special decrees and laws treating Jerusalem as a purely Israeli zone subject to the same organizational , legal and administrative rules applicable to other Israeli cities .  
Recalling its previous resolutions on the subject of the role of science and technology in the context of international security , disarmament and other related fields , in which , inter alia , it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged ,

The international community as a whole has taken a stand on this subject , in a virtually consensual manner , in endorsing the objective of a total ban on anti _ personnel mines by a very large majority with no negative votes in United Nations General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 L .

Also requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources , to provide increased advisory services and technical assistance to Member States , at their request , in particular in the elaboration of national strategies , the elaboration or improvement of legislative and regulatory measures , the establishment or strengthening of national capacities to prevent and control corruption , as well as in training and upgrading skills of relevant personnel ;  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .

These efforts towards reorganization reflect the common understanding that in order to provide objective , impartial and candid assessments , the audit unit has to be granted an adequate measure of operational independence from the entities subject to its scrutiny .  
The South African political climate is fortunately relaxed and there is no persecution of any sector of opinion ; the rules in force are those of a State subject to the rule of law in which institutions such as the Parliament and the judiciary are respected and one of the main concerns is the solidity of the legal edifice , starting with the new Constitution , on the basis of which democracy is a stable system that is appreciated by all and capable of making South Africa a model country .  
The representative of the United Kingdom found the original proposal of the representative of South Africa for a new article W acceptable to his delegation , because it maintained the status quo ( i.e . funding of human rights defenders being subject to national legislation consistent with applicable international law ) .

Urges the Government of the Sudan to investigate reported policies or activities which support , condone , encourage or foster the sale of or trafficking in children , separate children from their families and social backgrounds , forcibly round up children from the streets , or which subject children to forced internment , indoctrination or cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , and to terminate immediately any such policies or activities and bring to trial any persons suspected of supporting or participating in them ;  
The reason for this is that , although children unquestionably require protection from enlistment in the ranks of these groups , the political and military circumstances of these entities vary to an extent that makes it not only difficult to subject them to a standard rule but also dangerous to accord them international legal status , which might be misinterpreted as granting them implicit recognition .

On the subject of human rights violations committed on the orders or with the sanction of Governments , it must be borne in mind that the term Government in this context is used not in the narrow sense , to designate the highest executive organ ( the council of ministers , cabinet or suchlike ) , but the entire system of State bodies , particularly legislative and executive , and the associated officials , since it is they who are most often the instigators when violations of human rights occur .

The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .

For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .

Even though there was a decrease of 1.8 per cent in the overall percentage of promotions of women in posts subject to geographical distribution , the percentage of promotions for women at the D-1 and P-5 levels has increased considerably as compared with the previous year , thus increasing the pool of women eligible for promotion to senior decision-making levels in the near future .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings subject to the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 24 .

Requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of funds from the regular budget or extrabudgetary resources , to arrange for additional meetings to be scheduled for negotiation of the protocols , with a view to enhancing the potential for the expeditious and simultaneous completion of the convention against transnational organized crime and the protocols thereto ;  
The wording as it stood was unfortunate as it included no mention of compensation for expropriation , which in France was determined , after the administrative phase of the expropriation procedure had been carried out , in special court proceedings and subject to constitutional constraints whereby the judge was the guarantor of respect for private property rights .

Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept and practice of affirmative action , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
However , to legitimize beyond any doubt the ways and means used to take issues that originally belonged to the realm of international law away from it and to justify making them subject solely to domestic legislation unilaterally passed by the States and adjudicated by domestic non-indigenous courts , States should produce unassailable proof that the indigenous peoples in question have expressly and of their own free will renounced their sovereign attributes .  
Jurists ( with their conceptual elaborations ) , domestic laws ( with their imperativeness both in the metropolis and in the colonies ) , the judiciary ( subject to the rule of [ non-indigenous ] law ) , one-sided international law ( its enforcement assured by military means ) and international tribunals ( on the basis of existing international law ) were all present to validate juridically the organized plunder at the various stages of the colonial enterprise .

If the primary injured subject changed from , e.g . , the individual to a State of which he is a national , this would affect the application of the rule of the exhaustion of local remedies insofar as it did not apply in the case of a composite wrongful act .  
While the Commission could not express an opinion , for example , on whether expropriation was a continuing or a completed wrongful act , it could emphasize the primacy of article 18 , so that acts that had been complete at a time when they had been lawful did not subsequently become the subject of contention because the law had changed .  
Article 27 , subparagraph ( b ) appeared to have excluded from its scope strictly bilateral treaty obligations in which State C was not bound by any rule contained in a treaty concluded between States A and B . On the other hand , as it currently stood , article 27 covered not only the case of obligations erga omnes but also rules of general international law to which both States were subject , such as rules on diplomatic relations , whether conventional or customary .

Replies received from Member States indicated that traditional and customary practices affecting the health of women and girls , in particular female genital mutilation , continued to be the subject of national action .

The proper place for paragraph 3 of article 19 is within the context of prevention at the international and not the national level , for the following reasons : firstly , this provision uses words such as States Parties shall cooperate , pursuant to bilateral or multilateral agreements , exchange information and coordinate administrative and other measures , which clearly indicate the international dimension of its subject matter .  
Some are prohibited ( for exports and for domestic , rather than imported , inputs ) ; others are actionable ( they can be punished subject to proof of injury ) ; and three are permissible ( all heavily utilized in the North Atlantic ) .

This is also true for the more general subject of transparency in conventional weapons , where we consider the Conference can and must complete the valuable work accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee established between the years 1992 and 1995 , to define concrete measures likely to increase confidence amongst States and strengthen international security .

My delegation hopes that in the future , instead of having to adopt two separate draft resolutions on the same subject , the First Committee and the General Assembly will be able to render unanimous support for a single draft resolution on nuclear disarmament negotiations that is comprehensive and acceptable to all .
