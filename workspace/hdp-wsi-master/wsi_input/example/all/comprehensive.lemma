While negotiations on conventional weapons , with a view to restricting the use of land-mines , and on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty are moving ahead satisfactorily , we can not ignore the unconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , a major , if flawed , disarmament instrument .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Indeed , if , unlike the two previous resolutions 48 / 70 and 49 / 70 ) , this draft resolution the last , we hope , on the subject of negotiations on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is not adopted by consensus , it would send a most undesirable signal to the negotiations at Geneva and could even be interpreted as revealing a decline in the support of the international community for the early and speedy conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
Although we firmly believe that action towards securing this new international legal instrument banning nuclear-test explosions in a verifiable and comprehensive manner is well advanced and irreversible , important political decisions on key treaty elements have yet to be taken in order to meet the deadline set by the NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
It is in this context that Indonesia has joined an overwhelming majority of States to conclude the ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty as a matter of the highest priority and an essential first step towards curbing the qualitative refinement of weapons and leading to their ultimate elimination .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .

Thus , the United States made public its view that nuclear testing was important for the security of the Western alliance , which depended on the maintenance of a reliable nuclear deterrence and that , consequently , it could consider a comprehensive test-ban treaty only as a " long-term objective " whose realization must be sought in the context of radical nuclear arms reductions , expanded confidence-building measures and , particularly , improved verification capabilities .

While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .

In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The Middle East region represents a case in point , where the qualitative imbalance in terms of armaments is so striking and where transparency and confidence can only come about if approached in a balanced and comprehensive way .  Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons , while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .

With regard to the external debt , the initiatives taken by the Bretton Woods institutions and creditor countries to alleviate the debt burden of the poorest and most heavily indebted countries and to find solutions to multilateral debt were insufficient and of limited scope , and the situation of middle-income countries which met their obligations promptly and in full was likewise unresolved ; hence a comprehensive and radical solution to the debt problem must be found .

One of our priorities is to provide a better standard of living for citizens , embodied in the context of the population strategy included in the comprehensive national strategy which summarized the population problem in the Sudan into three basic categories : the existing incompatibility of economic growth with that of population growth , declining population characteristics , and the imbalance of population distribution .  
Recognizing that they both take a substantive interest in areas of common concern and are committed to promoting a more comprehensive and relevant treatment of the subject matter while avoiding unproductive duplication and inconsistency of recommendations , the two Commissions have developed an elaborate coordinating mechanism .

Indeed , the national plan for comprehensive health care for adolescents and young people recognizes that male and female teenagers are capable within the law of taking informed and responsible decisions about their sexuality and reproduction , and that for them to do so they must be provided with suitable guidance and accessible services just for them .  
They should be comprehensive in their approach , while allowing for the flexible use of policy instruments in accordance with specific national and sectoral conditions , including those in the rural sector , and should be pursued , as appropriate , at national and international level with a particular focus on :  
These objectives include economic development , poverty eradication , sustainable population growth , universal access to comprehensive reproductive health services , reduction in infant and maternal mortality and universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap .

We also stress the need to complete without delay comprehensive and verifiable treaties to ban nuclear-weapon tests and to cut off the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices .

There is a need , as a matter of priority that should be addressed with courage and creativity , to reformulate policies and solutions to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries that would help create a climate of equal opportunity amongst peoples and nations and make use of the latent potential of many parts of the world in paving the way towards balanced and comprehensive development at the threshold of the twenty-first century .

Regional cooperation is a goal which we all seek , but it must be the result of the achievement of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East , including the resolution of the final status issues , as provided for in the Declaration of Principles .

The Conference on Disarmament has advanced towards the comprehensive test-ban treaty through sustained but slow efforts , and it has failed to begin negotiations on a convention prohibiting the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
There was also established a comprehensive phased programme with agreed time-frames for progressive and balanced reduction of stockpiles of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery , leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time .

While negotiations on conventional weapons , with a view to restricting the use of land-mines , and on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty are moving ahead satisfactorily , we can not ignore the unconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , a major , if flawed , disarmament instrument .  
In this connection I should like to state that an early conclusion of an effective and verifiable comprehensive test-ban treaty by 1996 would be fundamental to real progress towards the ultimate goal of complete nuclear disarmament and to the security of non-nuclear-weapon States .  
In concrete terms , that means concluding quickly the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty ( CTBT ) ; it means an energetic effort to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for weapons purposes ; and it means an effort to transform unilateral declarations on negative security assurances into legally binding treaty obligations . 
Indeed , if , unlike the two previous resolutions 48 / 70 and 49 / 70 ) , this draft resolution the last , we hope , on the subject of negotiations on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is not adopted by consensus , it would send a most undesirable signal to the negotiations at Geneva and could even be interpreted as revealing a decline in the support of the international community for the early and speedy conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
Although we firmly believe that action towards securing this new international legal instrument banning nuclear-test explosions in a verifiable and comprehensive manner is well advanced and irreversible , important political decisions on key treaty elements have yet to be taken in order to meet the deadline set by the NPT Review and Extension Conference .  
It is in this context that Indonesia has joined an overwhelming majority of States to conclude the ongoing negotiations on a comprehensive test-ban treaty as a matter of the highest priority and an essential first step towards curbing the qualitative refinement of weapons and leading to their ultimate elimination .  
It is to hoped that the three interlinked decisions on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament , on the strengthening of the review process of the Treaty , and on the indefinite extension will constitute a proper basis for the future effective and comprehensive implementation of the Treaty , bringing the world closer to the ultimate objective of achieving , at the earliest possible date , the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and nuclear disarmament .

Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
The Department is responsible for the management and direction of peacekeeping operations ; the provision of comprehensive administrative and logistic support to all field missions ; the development , maintenance and enhancement of a ready , flexible capacity to undertake peacekeeping and other field operations ; and for acting as the focal point in the coordination , monitoring and development of integrated mine-action programmes .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Urges all States to eliminate all obstacles to development at all levels , by pursuing the promotion and protection of economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights and by implementing comprehensive development programmes at the national level , integrating these rights into development activities , and by promoting effective international cooperation ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
The Council heard a comprehensive report presented by President Yasser Arafat , in which he discussed all aspects of the political situation and the principal tasks to be accomplished in the Palestinian arena , foremost among which is the successful establishment of an independent Palestinian State with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital .  
The Government should also conduct a comprehensive review of all educational curricula at the primary , secondary and tertiary levels with a view to eliminating remaining discriminatory aspects , remedying the stereotypical portrayal of women and girls and creating an educational environment that is conducive to girls and womens education and learning .  
The Committee expresses its appreciation to the Government of Thailand for its candid and comprehensive report , a supplementary report , as well as the additional information and written responses to the numerous questions put forward by the pre-session working group , as well as the clear responses provided in the oral presentation made by the representative of Thailand .  
The elimination of child labour required a comprehensive approach that addressed the conditions of poverty which caused and perpetuated the practice , and included solutions such as rehabilitation , alternative and remunerative employment for parents , the enforcement of legislative and administrative measures , and education and vocational training .  
The concept of social protection must be incorporated into a comprehensive employment policy framework , which should be concerned not only about creating jobs in normal periods of steady economic growth , but also and very much about dealing with the consequences of rapid job loss during economic crises and periods of restructuring .  
The work of the various thematic groups , organized around specific cross-cutting themes emerging from the international programmes , should now be further integrated to ensure a more comprehensive approach to conference follow-up , facilitating the development of a corresponding integrated follow-up at the national level .  
A common theme in each report is the need for a comprehensive approach , elaborated jointly with national authorities , other United Nations agencies , the Bretton Woods institutions and major donors , and linking the political , humanitarian , human rights and development concerns .  
The analysis conducted by the General Assembly for the triennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system in 1998 confirmed that resident coordinators have an important role to play in assisting Governments in their responsibilities for the integrated implementation of the major international conferences .  
Within this context , in addition to the delivery of its regular programme of work , the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) assisted the region in facing the consequences derived from those two sets of events , through a mix of normative activities in the comprehensive analysis of development and public policy - making , and operational activities in the form of technical assistance , specialized information and training .  
In its resolution 1998 / 5 , the Sub _ Commission decided , since the subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept and practice of affirmative action , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
At its forty _ ninth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1997 / 107 taking note that it did not have sufficient time for a comprehensive discussion of the final report of the Special Rapporteur on income distribution and human rights ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1997 / 9 ) , decided to postpone to its fiftieth session the presentation by Mr . Bengoa of his final report and to request him to complete his report by preparing a supplementary document on this issue .  
At its forty _ fourth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its decision 1998 / 107 , decided to approve the appointment of Mrs .

While on the one hand every Government should remove obstacles blocking development within its State , such as failure to observe civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , effective international cooperation is essential in providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development , in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development .  
The Committee recalled that at its fifty-fifth and fifty-sixth sessions , pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 223 C of 23 December 1993 , it had undertaken a thorough and comprehensive review of all aspects of the scale methodology with a view to making it stable , simpler and more transparent while continuing to base it on reliable , verifiable and comparable data . 
One of our priorities is to provide a better standard of living for citizens , embodied in the context of the population strategy included in the comprehensive national strategy which summarized the population problem in the Sudan into three basic categories : the existing incompatibility of economic growth with that of population growth , declining population characteristics , and the imbalance of population distribution .  
Recognizing that they both take a substantive interest in areas of common concern and are committed to promoting a more comprehensive and relevant treatment of the subject matter while avoiding unproductive duplication and inconsistency of recommendations , the two Commissions have developed an elaborate coordinating mechanism .  
These included universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap in primary and secondary school education , wherever it exists ; universal access to primary health care ; universal access to a full range of comprehensive reproductive health-care services , including family planning , as set out in paragraph 7.6 of the Programme of Action ; reductions in infant , child and maternal morbidity and mortality ; and increased life expectancy .  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
The importance that the Government of Bolivia attaches to population matters is reflected in its comprehensive plan for economic and social development , which , under the concept of sustainable development , cross-cuts the areas of population , gender and generational and ethnic matters and highlights reproductive health as a matter of government policy .  
The comprehensive plan for economic and social development sets out as objectives and policies the easing of migratory movements , developing the urban periphery , rationalizing the use and management of natural resources , improving environmental quality , the gender perspective and reproductive health .  
Indeed , the national plan for comprehensive health care for adolescents and young people recognizes that male and female teenagers are capable within the law of taking informed and responsible decisions about their sexuality and reproduction , and that for them to do so they must be provided with suitable guidance and accessible services just for them .  
They should be comprehensive in their approach , while allowing for the flexible use of policy instruments in accordance with specific national and sectoral conditions , including those in the rural sector , and should be pursued , as appropriate , at national and international level with a particular focus on :  
These objectives include economic development , poverty eradication , sustainable population growth , universal access to comprehensive reproductive health services , reduction in infant and maternal mortality and universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap .  
It is also regrettable that UNAMET did not follow up on the advice of the Indonesian Task Force , and as earlier agreed between the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and the Personal Representative of the Secretary-General , on the need for a joint humanitarian mission involving UNAMET , the Indonesian Task Force and other relevant and competent United Nations agencies to address the problem of internally displaced persons and all its aspects in a comprehensive manner .  
Mexico thus considers that the promotion of knowledge of outer space and its technological applications should be encouraged both nationally and internationally , as part of the cultural heritage of present and future generations , fostering a comprehensive and integrated vision of the environment and a greater awareness of the potential uses of this resource and the need to preserve it .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
Accordingly , the Working Group had asked Mr . David Weissbrodt and Anti _ Slavery International , in consultation with non _ governmental organizations with an established record in that field , to prepare a comprehensive review of existing treaty and customary law covering all the traditional and contemporary slavery _ related practices and relevant monitoring mechanisms .  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
It recognizes that sustained action is required to promote rapid development of developing countries , and then declares : as a complement to the efforts of developing countries , effective international cooperation is essential in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive development .  
In fact , whether or not they were designed to be so , the sanctions invoked against UNITA are exactly the kind of focused sanctions that many of us have been talking about as the direction in which the Council should go , as opposed to the broad , pervasive , comprehensive sanctions that do such huge collateral damage .  
The Committee is concerned that the current data collection mechanism is insufficient to afford the systematic and comprehensive collection of disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data for all areas covered by the Convention in relation to all groups of children in order to monitor and evaluate progress achieved and assess the impact of policies adopted with respect to children .  
Concern is expressed at the lack of a systematic , comprehensive and disaggregated quantitative and qualitative data _ collection mechanism for all areas covered by the Convention , especially the most sensitive , such as child abuse or ill _ treatment , but also in relation to all vulnerable groups of children , especially girls , children with disabilities , children living in rural areas , children living in poverty and refugee children .  
Targeted sanctions are a less blunt instrument than comprehensive sanctions , thereby minimizing humanitarian costs , the disruption of non-military trade , the likelihood of a black market emerging , additional humanitarian aid requirements and a negative impact on social infrastructures .  
As already indicated , UNCTAD proposals for technical assistance to the Palestinian people in a number of project areas remain pending owing to the constrained resource base available for delivering prompt , effective and comprehensive assistance in response to outstanding priority requests by the PA .  
The objectives were twofold : to collect comprehensive information on the stock of cross-border equities and long-term debt securities for use in the compilation or improvement of international investment position statistics ; and to allow the bilateral exchange of comparable data , in order to improve estimates of non-resident holdings of portfolio liabilities , as well as associated capital flows and investment income data .  
Ambassador Moher arrived four years ago , at a crucial time , when the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty were entering their final stage , and he injected into our deliberations a remarkable blend of deep knowledge of the issues under negotiation , an ingredient of iron _ clad logic and a special ability to build bridges between opposing views .  
From my perspective the basic premise upon which the CD is established is the conviction that measures to promote and achieve non _ proliferation , arms control and disarmament are vital dimensions of a complex and comprehensive effort to enhance international security between sovereign States and to secure human security for all . 
Inspections provide the High Commissioner with comprehensive and systematic assessments of UNHCR operations , focusing on those factors , both internal and external to UNHCR , considered most relevant to the effective and efficient discharge of UNHCRs responsibilities .  
Lack of governmental coordination at the national level : Responsibility for family issues and programmes concerning individual family members ( for example , children , women , youth and so forth ) is usually shared between numerous ministries and agencies within a given country , giving rise to many coordination challenges and making it difficult to develop and implement comprehensive strategies for families , children and so on ;  
In launching the preparatory process for the Conference , the Secretary-General of the Conference emphasized the importance of a comprehensive and participatory preparatory process at the country level , which should involve interministerial departments , civil society , private sector and local government representatives .  
Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) and the Memorandum of Understanding signed between Iraq and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 20 May 1996 confirmed the exceptional and temporary nature of the oil-for-food programme which was intended to provide for the most urgent humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people who were subjected to collective punishment through the most vile regime of comprehensive sanctions in history .  
It reads : To play a leading role in advancing comprehensive and sustainable human development through the enhanced participation of Jordanians , the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development strives to impact best development practices at the national level , drawing on its experience and local presence , while creating opportunities and expanding the choices of Jordanians to play a central role in the process of shaping the countrys future . 
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
The project is being extended to 2001 to accommodate the increased demand for legislative assistance as a result of a comprehensive review by the Governments of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent States of their nuclear legislation and regulations , including non-proliferation and physical protection of nuclear material and facilities .  
The new approach stresses the need for better integrated ( or comprehensive ) technical cooperation programmes , regular dialogue with key stakeholders in the countries , especially those in the private sector , and stronger partnership among United Nations agencies and donor agencies to promote private sector-led industrial development and good corporate governance through interactive policy formulation and implementation .  
To close the income and technological gap between the region and the rest of the world requires a more comprehensive approach , including effective public and private investments in industrial infrastructure , strengthening of technological capabilities through human resource development , institution-building and effective economic governance .  
The Seminar was also to review the political , economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories and to identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in the programmes of assistance and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the political and sustainable socio-economic development of the Territories concerned .  
We have heard a comprehensive report on the evolution of the United Nations role in decolonization ; we have received prescriptions for addressing this critical issue for our small island Territories in a new millennium ; and we have listened intently to the extensive dialogue on the impact of unilateral changes on the offshore financial sector of the Territories . 
Costa Rica , Croatia , Singapore and Togo noted that the same standard with regard to remuneration , conditions of work and terms of employment applied to foreign and national workers , with women migrant workers having the same rights with regard to job security , extended vacation , night and overtime work as national women workers . 15 Costa Rica provided comprehensive information regarding migration into its territory , including penalties for illegal migration . 
Singapore drew attention to a recent penal provision enhancing penalties for offences committed against foreign domestic workers by employers or members of the household of employers . 16 The Philippines indicated that its comprehensive legislation on migrant workers , including protective provisions for such workers and penalties for abuses , such as illegal recruitment , and providing for information dissemination and shared information systems for governmental agencies , was being accessed . 
Because human rights violations occur in combination with other factors political , ethnic and economic conflicts , famine , insecurity , violence , poverty and environmental degradation the Assembly also recognized that comprehensive approaches , in particular early warning , require an intersectoral and multidisciplinary approach to enable a coherent response , particularly at the international and regional levels .  
Finally , coordination between the human rights and humanitarian components of United Nations operations , on the one hand , and political and military components , on the other , will help ensure sharing of information needed to assess the likelihood of mass exoduses and formulate and implement strategies to prevent , prepare for and respond to these emergencies in an effective and comprehensive manner .  
Fourthly , in terms of comprehensive peacekeeping mandates , it was encouraging to hear members emphasize the changing perception of peacekeeping operations and the recognition that modern peacekeeping entails more comprehensive operations with extremely complex , multifaceted programmes and , indeed , more robust enforcement mandates , as has been discussed in this Council in recent days .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
To this end the Special Rapporteur welcomes the newly-created Stability Pact of the European Union for south-eastern Europe , which outlines a comprehensive approach to the region and promises the States of south-eastern Europe international assistance and eventual integration into European political and economic structures in return for ongoing progress towards democracy , respect for human rights , and regional cooperation .  
Mr . Gbeho ( Ghana ) : I am happy and privileged to participate in this crucial Security Council debate on the situation in Africa , and I wish to begin by joining in the warm sentiments expressed to you , Sir , and to other members of the Council by previous speakers .  I must also highly commend the Secretary-General for the comprehensive progress report ( S / 1999 / 1008 ) on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his earlier report ( S / 1998 / 318 ) .  
In this context , we would like to add that if the international community , just recently , was able to act in a concerted and comprehensive manner to resolve an issue which had received so much global attention , we firmly believe that if the same concerted and comprehensive approach were applied to Africa , it would surely resolve many of the major problems facing that continent .  
Underlining that comprehensive , coherent and effective policies on irregular / undocumented migration have to be formulated within the context of a broader regional framework based on a spirit of partnership and common understanding ;  
" Under the leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Hussein and the Jordanian Government , the country is continuing its efforts in its contacts and meetings with the regional and international parties concerned to advance the peace process on all tracks , believing as it does in the inclusive character of any solution that will achieve a just , comprehensive and lasting peace , bring security and stability to the region and secure prosperity for its peoples .  
More broadly speaking , the Kosovo crisis has made it even clearer that only through a comprehensive international effort - at the political , economic and social levels - will the Balkans be able to move from chronic conflict to stability , development and progressive integration in Europe .  
Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on this item to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , least developed countries and middle - income developing countries , as well as proposals for specific and concrete measures or mechanisms to resolve these problems in a durable manner ;  
Emphasizing the need for objective , comprehensive , broad-based information and a wide exchange of experiences and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers ,  
A comprehensive approach was needed in addressing Africa 's structural constraints , including its weak infrastructure and high transport costs , which continued to undermine the expected gains from economic reforms , making it difficult to attract adequate foreign private investment .  
She emphasized that the Conference would involve a comprehensive and extensive preparatory process at the country level which should involve ministerial departments and representatives of civil society , the private sector and local government .  
This could be achieved if the international community would : recognize the special situation and needs of African countries , particularly supply constraints ; apply differential treatment in favour of developing countries , including small and vulnerable economies , in a concrete and comprehensive fashion ; and remove all barriers facing the trade of African countries , in particular of the least developed countries .

As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
The Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which were small island Territories , required and deserved the comprehensive support of the international community , which must assist the Territories to fulfil their aspirations to achieve not only political but also economic , social and cultural well-being .  
With this objective in mind , ACC decided to undertake during 1999 a comprehensive assessment of the demands placed on the national and international systems by the new global environment that is emerging at the end of the twentieth century .  
In order to achieve respect for cultural differences within a context of national unity , national reconciliation and democratic coexistence , it is essential to implement a comprehensive , nationwide programme of civic education , for which the necessary human and financial resources must be provided .  
Recognizing that , while the process of globalization brings with it opportunities , it poses new challenges and risks for developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , at a time when they are intensifying their efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and directing their national policies towards the eradication of poverty through the implementation of comprehensive strategies , policies and programmes , including those with a long-term perspective ,  
As far as trade and finance was concerned , the forthcoming round of trade negotiations in the context of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) should be comprehensive and move the process of trade liberalization forward , strengthen the framework for the functioning of the multilateral trading system and ensure that the particular interests and concerns of developing countries were taken into account .  
Just as the Palestinian issue was at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict , the question of the Palestinian refugees was central to the future of the peace arrangements that would follow the conclusion of a just , lasting and comprehensive peace based on the relevant international resolutions and in particular General Assembly resolution 194 ( III ) , which clearly affirmed the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and to be paid compensation for loss of property . 
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
As indicated in paragraph 2 of the report of the Secretary-General ( A / 54 / 355 ) , the package of agreements signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca ( URNG ) included detailed commitments on political , legislative , social , economic , agrarian , ethnic , military and public security issues , which were consolidated into a comprehensive peace agenda .
