This was followed by impressionistic pieces on foreign lands , such as Paris and London , which coincided with the period of exoticism in the late fifties but are unmistakably individual because of their dramatic rather than merely lyrical treatment .

"  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago .

Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations .

In his choice of these genres , and by defining his period of investigation at the late Ching to the present day , David Wang not only objectively grasps how the basic distinctive essence of the contemporary and modern Chinese novel is in the emergence and evolution of the modern consciousness which is unfolded within its pages ; in fact he also displays how his subjective concern is the entire flood torrent of China 's headlong progress toward modernization .  
Also , because it is cut off from the rest of Taiwan by mountains that run right down to the coast , the east developed relatively late . Many valuable cultural artifacts have thus been preserved up to the present , and there are many archaeological sites from former cultures that settled here .

In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings .

She remembers that when the kids played soldiers in school , the losers would often be ridiculed as " Zhi Na [ Chinese ] troops , " indicating how inept they were .

But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
" Archaeological sites in Taiwan have flaked tools like these from the paleolithic to the late neolithic eras , " notes Liu . From the standards of craftsmanship in their jade and decorative jewelry , it is clear that these people of ancient times were not without skill . However , it appears that as far as implements for daily use are concerned , their attitude may well have been " it 's enough if it 's usable . "  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
In the late 1940s , the then bustling and cosmopolitan Shanghai rejoiced at having survived World War II relatively unscathed . But when the red tide of communism flooded through China , it marked the end for the city : foreign and Chinese entrepreneurs alike were swept out through its gates and their assets seized by the state .  
Another oral history of note is that of the musician and actor Liu Chin , a member of the Taiwanese opera troupe of the legendary " Ilan Ying . " Liu 's seventy-year lifespan has essentially coincided with the rise and fall of Taiwanese opera . Because Liu was very familiar with the late Ilan Ying , through interviews with Liu the character and personality of Ilan Ying are vividly depicted , yielding valuable first - hand information for future researchers studying the history of Taiwanese opera in Ilan .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
They have great vitality and are adapted to hostile conditions . The pine seeds grow wherever they fall : in cracks in rocks , on precipices . Thus they appear in tenacious postures , even clinging crazily to sheer crags . In late Autumn , when other trees have shed their leaves and the flowers have all withered , often all that is left is the " lone pine on a winter ridge . "  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
The Academia Sinica is quite confident in stating that researchers of early and medieval imperial Chinese history , for instance , can regard the on-line Twenty-Five Books of History as primary sources . For researchers of late imperial China from the Song dynasty on , because there are abundant historical materials , the materials of this archive are not the only ones available , but they certainly should not be overlooked .  
In the records of the late Eastern Han , the " Guanglingsan " was listed as folk music current in the Han and Wei regions , but in the records of the Song , it says " the ' Guanglingsan ' is no longer extant . " Lin Ku-fang points out that the music of ancient China always persisted extraneous to statements whether it was extant or not ; it was preserved in a state so that at times it was hidden , at times evident .  
In the late Ming dynasty , it is said that the salt merchants of Yangzhou graced their great halls with mechanical nudes . The export porcelain of Guangzhou is adorned with grossly distorted depictions of the crucifixion and naked missionaries chasing peasant girls . Who knows , then , what clever tricks Chambers ' rich business acquaintances in Guangzhou might have wanted to show off when trying to impress the Westerner ?  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
Here in Taiwan , however , under the umbrella of the Wildlife Conservation Law , any duck hunting can only be done on the sly . But people still have a deep sense that other countries must be making a better job of things . At a " Kuantu Nature Reserve Symposium " held late last year , a wetlands expert reported how happily wild ducks and humans get along in Japan .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
But most of the travelogues which pre-date the late Ming concern travel within China . And although Journey to the West , which describes the Tang dynasty monk Tripitaka 's journey westward to collect Buddhist sutras , recounts a trip which went as far abroad as India , most of the book 's geography is made up . Kung Peng-cheng believes that Journey to the West is indistinguishable from the ancient Chinese idea of a distant journey to seek out a sage .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
Though the violins may be famous and expensive , visitors usually find the automated instruments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , on display at the entrance to the sixth floor , more interesting . When a volunteer demonstrates and explains the instruments , cranking the hand-powered gramophone , and starting up the player piano or the motor-driven " orchestra , " this old technology still proves capable of producing precise and beautiful melodies , leaving both adults and children amazed and struck with admiration for the artistic genius of our forebears .  
Chinese have been drinking tea for thousands of years , and it has long been a routine part of daily life . It appears in the traditional Chinese list of " essential items " for the kitchen , right up there with rice , soy sauce , oil , firewood , salt and vinegar . The late Lin Yutang described it as " a widespread custom that has added much color to everyday life of the people . "  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
" Today 's exam system produces people who only know how to pass exams . The ones who are no good at exams go into the dummies ' class , and those who fail are filled with a sense of inferiority ; by that time , it 's too late to save them . " Under soft yellow lamplight in a simple but elegant teahouse , a circle of listeners attentively watch the speaker in the middle .  
Laozi and Confucius both emerged late in the Spring and Autumn period , in a time of frequent warfare when the system of moral education through ritual and music of the Zhou dynasty ( 11th century-256 BC ) had collapsed , and the nobility had abandoned themselves to a life of wanton extravagance supported by ruthless exploitation of the common people .  
Earth Lord temples can often be found amid lush green expanses of paddy-field , watching over the crops and blessing them with healthy growth . P The tutelary god known as " Earth Lord " has become a bit of a celebrity of late , showing up in various TV series with his beaming smile and long white whiskers , his trademark magic ingot and ruyi scepter in hand , helping out hapless victims of mistreatment .  
Museum director Chin Hsiao-yi has announced that another major exhibit , on the culture of the Han dynasty , will travel to Taiwan in late 1999 . Relics to be displayed include selected items from the museum 's own collection , items from the famed sites of Mawangdui and the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom , and other items to be borrowed from various private collectors in Taiwan . This exhibit will give a clear feel for the vast sweep of Han culture . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
The rapid ascent in the late twentieth century of the " 3C " industries-the capital - and technology-intensive semiconductor industry ( ICs ) , computer component production and assembly ( PCs ) , and electronic consumer goods ( ECs ) - has given Taiwan a strong hand in terms of global economic competition .  
On the flip side of the coin , the extensive and rapid development of golf courses has brought with it a sizable environmental impact , and reports of destruction of fragile hilly land areas , water consumption , pesticide use , and occupation of state land stream through the media in a constant flow . Exposure of such issues finally came to a head in the late 1980s , when environmentalists began the " movement against golf course development , " which elicited general sympathy among the public .  
On the evening of October 22 , the late autumn air of Taipei was just a little chilly , but the plaza in front of the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall was hot and teeming with people . More than 10,000 music fans were crowded together , some sitting , some standing , all waiting for the concert " Nature and Hope : A Voyage to Paradise . " The show was a benefit concert for the Eden Foundation , to help those who were left physically handicapped by the Sept . 21 earthquake .  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
Under the crisp and pleasant skies of late December , Mrs . Pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in Taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties ( 24 kg ) of streaky pork . When the meat arrives she chops it into one-catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry-fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and Gaoliang liquor .  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
Shen Zhongwen , the late mainland Chinese writer , once noted that in the mainland they view Xu Zhimo as having been somewhat of the perpetual child : " It is always acknowledged that he was supremely talented , but he is ultimately regarded as being a spokesman for the decadent capitalist class , little more than a spoiled dandy . "  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ? Meanwhile , between early 1996 and late 1999 , the annual return of the weighted index of the Taiwan stock exchange ( Taiex ) was 17% , or more than triple a one-year certificate of deposit .  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
This year , on the seventh day of that month , one tour bus after another wound up a twisting mountain road , bound for a gathering at the True Buddha School 's Vijaya Temple in Tsaotun , Nantou County . Later , on the 13th of the month , the Longhua Assembly of the T'ienti Teachings Association was held at the Tienchi Hsingkung Temple in Taichung . Though held late at night , it attracted thousands of devotees . Dressed in blue robes , they chanted the sect 's sutras with deep concentration .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse . While the president in late May was traveling abroad and raising Taiwan 's international profile , bad news was breaking at home . The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Born in 1960 , Lan Po-chou grew up in Miaoli County in central Taiwan and graduated with a degree in French literature from Fu Jen Catholic University . Motivated by a deep interest in Taiwanese history , during the late 1980s Lan began to work for Ren Jian Magazine , whose main mission was to bring to light hidden aspects of society . As a writer for this magazine he laid the foundations for his latter fieldwork and investigative reports .  
Lee first gained acclaim in the late 1950s with semi-abstract works depicting dilapidated scenes of faded glory , featuring architectural elements to set the tone . In these works he used a coarse , brusque style to create a feeling of loss . This was the first attempt by Lee to usher Chinese elements into Western artistic form . This series of works won him several international awards and established his position as an important contemporary painter  
But this rare catch of a pregnant shark also confirmed how late whale sharks mature , and showed that in their reproductive strategy they prefer " quality " over " quantity . " In today 's age of unbridled exploitation of ocean fisheries , this does not bode well for the survival of whale shark populations .  
In fact it is not unusual for a change of seasons to occasionally come early or late and upset the sequence of nature , and it is quite common for plants to be fooled by the weather . In ancient times farmers were aware that " if a fruit tree that normally flowers in spring blossoms in autumn , it will not set fruit . "  
In the late 1960s and early ' 70s , rapid economic develop-ment in Japan triggered a lopsided concentration of population and infrastructure in that country 's urban areas , and a serious decline of rural towns and villages , as people flocked to the cities and misguided development schemes wrought havoc left and right . At the same time , the signing of a US-Japan security treaty spawned protests throughout the 1960s by university students concerned about the possibility of Japan returning to its former militarism .  
" Independent , close to ordinary people 's hearts , vital , spring-flowering , sublimely pure and noble . " Students involved in the student movement of the late 1980s created a huge wild lily modeled on the Statue of Liberty , to symbolize the spirit of the Taiwanese student movement .  
In late January , Legislative Yuan member Apollo Chen held a press conference to plead the case for giving permanent residency rights to Doris Brougham and other foreigners who long ago put down roots in Taiwan . Both ruling and opposition parties agreed that the issue was worthy of prompt attention , and later President Chen Shui-bian and interior minister Yu Cheng-hsien also publicly expressed their support .  
The late Lin Heng-tao , an expert on local history and customs , wrote that during the Japanese occupation the Octagon Market was Taiwan 's most fashionable shopping area . Popular merchandise included milk candy , red bean sweet bread , Tong Luo barbeque , sushi , and other Japanese foods . There were also handguns , telescopes , Japanese Warrior brand art supplies , toys , sake , beer , and soft drinks .  
In addition to the acute harm caused by large quantities of poisonous chemicals , in the late 1980s people discovered that despite the increasing level of controls over the use of chemicals , even low levels of some compounds could still lead to chronic effects such as tumors , birth defects and genetic mutations .  
Over the past few decades , the history of Taiwan has become a hot academic specialty , and breakthroughs have been many , but the field remains plagued by a certain lack of depth . Ever since the Ming loyalist Koxinga ( Zheng Chenggong ) ruled over the island in the late 17th century , almost all Chinese-language scholarship on the subject has consisted of written tracts , with very few visual images . Japanese-language scholarship has been more diverse in nature , but has focused largely on the period of Japan 's colonial rule here .  
An October weekend in Suzhou 's Mudu Town , there 's not a cloud in the sky but the cold wind chills to the bone . In order to control costs , the film crew for producer Young Pei-pei 's adapted script based on Gu Long 's famous martial arts novel Flying Sword Meets Flying Sword has divided into two groups who work in shifts from early morning to late at night .  
At 5 a.m . on June 13 , to the accompaniment of sonorous beiguan music , priests at the temple began to make a report to Heaven about the jiao , explaining the reasons for it and its scheduled itinerary . For three days running , from early in the morning to late at night , the sound of festive beiguan music with suona horns and gongs , as well as the loud and clear chanting of the Daoist priests , drifted from the main hall .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
Whereas their predecessors ' values were shaped most by great economic opportunity and the experience of collective action for political and social change , many different elements have affected the values of these generations . Besides larger structural factors , educational reform has also been important . The reforms introduced by the government in the late 1990s increased the number of universities and graduate programs significantly , so that many more young people have access to higher education than did their predecessors .  
Of the 34 lighthouses Taiwan has built on its coasts and nearby islands , Huang Ching-jung has been a keeper for 27 , more than any other person in the country . Forty-five of the 75 years of his life have been spent among the lighthouses . Although he has been retired for ten years , Huang has still not lost his feeling for the lighthouses . He uses discarded pipes to make models of the lighthouses that he puts in his home , and in many dreams late at night he is still connected to the lighthouses .  
The erudite Buddhist master Yin-Shun , said to be " the most eminent Buddhist since Xuan Zang , " celebrated his 100th birthday in late April , on the 20th day of the third lunar month . A huge conference was held jointly by Buddhist religious and academic communities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . It was a memorable event , as many Buddhist groups in Taiwan have been inspired by Yin-Shun 's teaching , and were in attendance to mark his birthday .  
If that is not effective , the sufferer should take another puff in half an hour , and if that does not work they should immediately be rushed to an emergency ward . If the respiratory tract has contracted to the point where the bronchodilator can not get through , the patient will need an immediate injection before it is too late . Repeated use of a bronchodilator , however , can lead to cardiac arrhythmia .  
Aside from the perils of daily life , the great exploits of history that are worthy of the name " exploration " were highly focused in their goals . Tang-dynasty monk Xuanzang 's 17-year quest for Buddhist scriptures in India , Genghis Khan 's long westward campaign to take Khwarazm , or the " voyages of discovery " of Zheng He in the late 14th century and the Spanish and Portuguese in the 15th , were daring adventures that reaped rich rewards and inspired many to follow after .  
Then in late April Kenneth Pai , a literary icon in his own right and a tireless promoter of Kun Opera , followed with his own production of The Peony Pavilion , a moving and beautiful spectacle that brought packed houses at the National Theater to their feet for long and rapturous standing ovations .  
In its Mental Health Index Survey , completed late last year , the Mental Health Foundation discovered that approximately one half of the 1,000 individuals surveyed admitted that a slight increase in stress causes them to blow up . Even more shocking is the fact that 19 participants gave themselves " zero " when asked to quantify their mental health . Clear warning signals are flashing for the mental health of Taiwanese .  
A few extra charcoal blocks are thrown on the fire to boil water and provide heat . Although the temperature in Taiwan 's plains can go as high as 30oC in late May , when night comes , it falls to 4-5oC on the north peak and there is often a strong cold wind . Sweaters , hats and thick socks are basic requirements all year round . " Not until November 1997 did a helicopter bring the first load of charcoal to the Yushan Weather Station , " says Hsieh .  
As the maritime point of entry and exit for northern Taiwan , Keelung was able ( thanks in part to intense lobbying by local government and elected officials ) to gain central government approval despite its currently having only 68 hectares of available land . The FTZ there is set to begin operating in late September this year .  
If the probability of late effects is proportional to effective dose at low doses , which is probably the case , the collective effective dose is an indicator of the total attributable harm to be expected in that group and its descendants .  
Despite the rapid spread of contraceptive practice , unwanted births still constituted about one fourth of total fertility at the time of surveys conducted in the developing countries in the late 1980s .  
MEXICO Request : In late May 1994 , the Government requested technical assistance to national observers for the elections scheduled for 21 August 1994 and , prior to the elections , the preparation of an analytical report on the Mexican electoral system .  
The United Republic of Tanzania , which in the late 1970s and early 1980s implemented a successful technical project to stop overgrazing-induced land degradation by destocking some 120,000 head of cattle in the Kondoa district of central Tanzania , is now working on the socio-economic aspect , seeking ways to manage growing population pressure and reintroduce livestock into the farming systems of the under-utilized , formerly eroded area .  
Although endowed with more sophisticated capacity and resources than others , the Institute has found it difficult at this late stage to adapt quickly to the needs of the land programme , especially as most of its previous experience related to titling of housing in urban areas in which there was a fairly reliable registry and census of properties and relatively easy access .  
In accordance with decisions of the Committee on Conferences , the time utilized for informal meetings or consultations held before the start or after the adjournment of officially scheduled meetings is not included as time lost due to late starting or early ending of meetings .  
The causes of the precarious financial situation were plain and followed the same pattern as in previous years , namely late or non-payment of assessed contributions for both the regular budget and peace-keeping operations ; delay between the approval of peace-keeping operations by the Security Council and the receipt of cash to pay for them ; and an increasing number of unfunded mandates . 
ODA is one such international opportunity , and for many countries , it is a crucial one .  But with generally weakening oil prices and regional wars , the average saving rate of these countries fell from almost 65 per cent of GDP in the mid-1970s to less than 25 per cent by the late 1980s ( see United Nations , World Economic Survey , 1992 ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
The classical codification procedure of elaborating draft articles as a basis for international diplomatic conferences , with a view to the subsequent adoption of binding instruments of international law , had been successful in the past , but of late had proved rather inflexible and should be reconsidered .  
Some claim to have been denied housing because they are not associated with successful political parties or because they were orphans , refugees or other disadvantaged people who returned to the city or town too late , or were too powerless , to secure access to free housing in premises abandoned by their former owners .  
The Board 's analysis of country offices in the biennium established the common causes of unsatisfactory implementation as political instability , frequent changes in the leadership of implementing partners , delayed delivery of supplies , unrealistic project targets and late receipt of funds .  
The characteristic distinction of the late twentieth century is that relations among nations are based on interrelated , mutual and diverse interests in various political , economic and social fields .  
The human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic is another scourge of our time and a serious threat to humanity .  The socio-economic consequences of the disease are a matter of grave concern , and the international community should make concerted efforts to address this human tragedy which affects the young and the productive sectors of our societies in particular before it is too late .  
I should like for a moment to pay a tribute here to a generation of young people which the media has of late characterized as being lost the young people of Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia who , not so many years ago , were confident children of Europe and who have now spent their youth amidst fratricidal struggles and ethnic cleansing , with all the revulsion inherent in that expression , a youth spent between death and barbarism .  
Although 1996 began on a promising note with the peaceful and democratic general elections held in Palestine on 20 January , a series of devastating terrorist attacks against Israel in late February and early March quickly enveloped the spirit of optimism surrounding the peace process in a sombre and cynical cloud .  
Considering the late stage of our work , and given the importance that my delegation attached to the full and effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the work of the Preparatory Commission in this regard , and in the spirit of cooperation , we decided not to insist on our original proposal on the work of the Preparatory Commission and agreed to language that was incorporated in A / C . 1 / 51 / L . 48 / Rev . 1 as a new operative paragraph 6 .  
The development of modern planned forestry practices in Western Europe can be traced to the late 1700s , a time of rapid population growth , expanding urbanization , explosive scientific discovery and increasing confidence in mankind 's ability to master nature .  
The rapid growth in environmental regulation during the late 1980s and early 1990s , together with growing demands from customers , has encouraged business and industry to examine a range of strategies and techniques for moving towards more sustainable production and consumption .  
The report also indicated that , under prevailing conditions and logistics , the earliest possible date on which elections could be held would be late February or early March 1997 , on condition that the outstanding policy issues are resolved by mid-October , failing which a further delay would be unavoidable .  
The mission was of the view that , under prevailing conditions and constraints , the earliest possible date on which elections could be held would be late February or early March 1997 , and that holding elections during that period would depend on outstanding policy issues being resolved by mid-October , failing which a further delay would be inevitable .

He also briefed them how Hong Kong has risen up to the challenges and opportunities arising from economic restructuring and economic integration with the Mainland of China , and continued to be a thriving international financial and business centre in the region . 
The main objective of the study , which will be completed in late 2003 , is to formulate a competitive and sustainable strategy and master plan for Hong Kong 's port development for the coming 20 years and beyond .  
The Wide Field of Plastics With active assistance of the government and continued efforts of businessmen , the plastics industry in Taiwan , though starting late , has developed very rapidly . Beginning with processing imported raw materials into daily necessities , then expanding to the current export of self-produced raw materials , its development has been beyond expectation . Plastics have become an important key to the economic development of the Republic of China .  
Rallies were held at national and local levels . There was a groundbreaking ceremony for the Chung Cheng Memorial Hall commemorating the career of the late President . Other activities included mountain climbing , picnics , sports and games , exhibitions , garden parties and lectures throughout the nation .  
Ta Hsi , a placid small town in Taoyan ( Pear Garden ) , is known for its many faces . It is considered particularly favored by nature in its beautiful location between its mountains and rivers . One can sense a subtle new force ever since the mortal remains of the late President Chiang were laid to rest there .  
His journey to the forefront of the local arts scene started 20 years ago , when Chang Ta-chien , one of the most famous traditional Chinese painters , held an art exhibition Taipei . Li Chi-mao , then an unknown , but talented painter , was among the admiring spectators . He was so fascinated with Chang 's paintings that he stayed too late at the exhibition and missed the last bus .  
His will is inscribed on the base of the statue , and six big characters Lun Li ( ethics ) , Ming Chu ( democracy ) , and Ko Hsueh ( science ) are inscribed on the marble wall behind the statue . The late President 's famous sayings : " To live is to seek a better life for all mankind ; the meaning of life lies in the creation of a life beyond life " is engraved on the two sides of the main hall .  
Walking along , one catches glimpses of students in green uniforms , their heads held high , their bodies straight , but comfortable . A sense of dignity is everywhere , as it should be , for here are trained only the most promising and talented young men of the Republic of China . The late President Chiang Kai-shek once said : " Without the study of science , there can be no national defense ; without national defense there can be no country . Modern national defense must have science education as its basis . "  
These character inscriptions provide valuable information as to the life during this early period of Chinese history . The late years of the Chou marked the beginning of a long period of political instability throughout north and east China . This period which is recorded in the classic annals of " the Spring and Autumn " ( 722-484 BC ) saw China divided up into rival kingdoms , each with their own written language .  
Yet closer examination reveals that the garments covering the ladies ' shoulders and necks are actually made of very thin , transparent material . While women of the early T'ang were strong yet slim , by the late T'ang they were more amply endowed , reflecting their rich court lifestyle .  
From then until the late nineteenth century , Tainan served as the political , cultural and economic center of Taiwan . Its rich history has left Tainan with a heritage of cultural landmarks and scholarly contributions unmatched elsewhere on the island .  
Quality products can not be developed overnight . Taiwan began its technological development at a relatively late stage . Lacking substantial capital and advanced technology , and facing stiff competition from Japan and the West , Taiwan manufacturers have chosen two methods of survival .  
Lu reports that one day in the late nineteenth century , a chef for an official family heard his employer singing the praises of a great dish he had just eaten , an exquisite meal of duck and chicken baked in a wine jug . The first efforts at imitation were less than ideal , so the official took the cook to the original house to learn it straight from the wife who had prepared the dinner . Later , when the chef started his own restaurant , he kept adding to and improving the recipe .  
Wings of Glory Representing the glorious tradition of the Chinese air command , the Chinese Air Force Academy stands as a landmark in modern military training . Originally founded in 1932 by the late President Chiang Kai-shek , the school has grown from its original humble origins near Hangchou , to its present modern facility in Kaohsiung County , southern Taiwan .  
Puppet theatre has experienced difficult times as of late . A rural art , it lost much of its audience in the tremendous urbanization of the past twenty years . In addition , being educated has come to mean being Westernized for many people , leaving them to shun traditional Chinese art .  
These observations coincide closely with records concerning saris in the Buddhist scriptures . " The article went on to explain that " the reasons for the formation of gallstones can be hereditary , or one 's natural physical constitution , while the majority stem from a lack of physical excercise , a build-up of bile in the gallbladder , or irregular eating habits . . . . The late Hsin Jung vanished into monastic life at the age of sixteen and spent 32 years living as a monk .  
In the late 1970 ' s the local film scene acquired a new look . The Motion Picture Development Foundation film library , founded in 1978 with the support of the Government Information Office , began to systematically introduce famous European films and top-notch local works to its members . And starting in 1980 , an international film festival has been held every year in conjunction with the Golden Horse Awards to show foreign art films ( together with some high-standard commercial films ) nominated for the awards .  
May you grow old together " is a traditional good-luck wish for newlyweds . However , according to historians , the chances of that wish coming true were mighty slim in days past . Life expectancy in the Chou dynasty 2,600 years ago was eighteen . In the Han it was a mere 22 , and even as late as 260 years ago , in the Ching dynasty , it was only 28 .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
The scene was northern China , the language spontaneous and sometimes colloquial , and the mood ranging from nostalgia to humor . This was followed by impressionistic pieces on foreign lands , such as Paris and London , which coincided with the period of exoticism in the late fifties but are unmistakably individual because of their dramatic rather than merely lyrical treatment .  
We should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an even more active and responsible attitude . From central to local government , from representative bodies to the administrative agencies , all should make a thorough self-review , based on actual needs , and strengthen and improve where required , to fortify the substance and function of democracy .  
It 's due to our special circumstances , " says Liu Chih-cheng , a landscape designer who has hiked through many national parks in other countries . He points out that the R . O . C . ' s national parks were set up rather late , after they had already become popular tourist areas , unlike many parks overseas , which were established in unused " wastelands . "  
My main subject has always been the history of Buddhism in China and how it was changed by Chinese culture . I have also studied the history of the coming of Christianity to China during the late Ming and early Ch'ing , including how China received and transformed the influence and the Chinese reaction to it , such as the Taiping rebellion . That is the process that interests me most .  
Orchid Island is located about 49 nautical miles east of the city of Taitung . With education relatively late and travel inconvenient , much traditional culture and thinking is preserved .  
As chief architect of the temple 's reconstruction , the late artist Li Mei-shu engaged Taiwan 's best temple builders and craftsmen in wood and stone carving in order to leave to posterity a fine cultural heritage of traditional architectural art . " Cheng Yu-ts'ai adds that many foreigners , particularly Japanese , make special journeys to see this " temple of oriental art . "  
And it was in the T'ang period that the vogue started for literary men to stamp calligraphy and paintings with chops . Early chops were carved by craftsmen and tend to have a workaday air , and they were generally made from jade , gold , bronze or iron . Wang Mien 's use of soft Hua-ju stone for carving his own seals in the late Yuan period marked a breakthrough in the use of materials and paved the way for the literati to carve seals themselves .  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
In the late 19th century , when colleges on the East Coast were still debating whether to open their doors to the general public , Cornell already accepted students of all backgrounds - - no matter whether they were black or white , rich or poor , male or female , all were treated the same .  
Puli is right in the geographic center of Taiwan . Some people say that Taiwan 's contemporary food market is ' controlled by President in the north and by Wei chuan in the south . ' Although Taiwan Sugar is getting off the blocks relatively late , one day you may be hearing ' Taiwan Sugar controls the center , ' " says Hsieh with confidence , because " there are still so many treasures to be unearthed at our Puli ! "  
It is like the dependency theory that was fashionable some years ago . This held that the late developing countries needed to depend on the advanced countries , with the result that such countries had no way to advance because the developed countries would not let them do so . Wanting to exploit their resources and labor , the developed countries would only allow the late-developers to do the most basic work .  
Taiwan developed relatively late , so that it was somewhat behind in terms of spraying pesticides , and the most destructive and toxic chemicals had already been banned for use anywhere in the world , so the problem was not so severe as in the advanced industrial nations . This was good luck . But since all that is true , and Taiwan has had the experience of others to serve as a mirror , why is it that today this has become a pressing problem for us ?  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
Because Ilan is at a low altitude and has many springs , the roots find it easy to quench their thirst and the trees ' crowns grow lush and full . Full of springs and developed by man relatively late , the areas where the mountains meet the plain have most of the remaining banyans .  
In his choice of these genres , and by defining his period of investigation at the late Ching to the present day , David Wang not only objectively grasps how the basic distinctive essence of the contemporary and modern Chinese novel is in the emergence and evolution of the modern consciousness which is unfolded within its pages ; in fact he also displays how his subjective concern is the entire flood torrent of China 's headlong progress toward modernization .  
Also , because it is cut off from the rest of Taiwan by mountains that run right down to the coast , the east developed relatively late . Many valuable cultural artifacts have thus been preserved up to the present , and there are many archaeological sites from former cultures that settled here .  
Their eldest son Che-ho turned 17 this year . Ever since he entered the equivalent of tenth grade in his vocational high school-cum-junior college , parents Chung Chiang-shan and Chang Pi-yun have seen their son pulled between what he 's been taught at home , on the one hand , and peer pressures and the lures of modern society on the other . Che-ho started asking if he could stay out until late at night . He dyed his hair , made repeated pleas for a pager and secretly brought his girlfriend home .  
In northern Taiwan all the old farmers can recite the saying " Before the Awakening of Insects , do n't plant rice seedlings . " This is because the weather around the Awakening of Insects is just beginning to warm up but can still be a little chilly . If the first crop of seedlings is frozen by a late cold spell , then the farmers ' labors will be left unrewarded .  
Passing through the main doorway and entering the lobby , one is first met by a bronze statue of the late President Chiang Kai-shek , the work of sculptor Chen Yi-fan . Behind the statue one enters the four-storey ( 16.5 m ) high rear lobby , which has round renaissance pillars and a granite floor polished to a mirror sheen . The sunlight entering through the high windows projects soft and elegant hues around the white-painted interior . A red carpet stretches from the main door and runs up the staircase .  
Chinese stevedores were expert tea stowersIt is said that in the 1860s , when the clipper tea races were at their height , representatives sent from London would often be so eager to get their goods on board ship that they did not have the patience to negotiate the keenest price , nor were they willing to wait until the best black teas came on the market in late May . They preferred to pay high prices to have tea hurriedly packed , loaded onto the clippers and rushed back to England .  
Li Hsiu , a Tainan native now in her late 50 ' s , still remembers that she watched films like these in primary school . " Everyone admired the heroism and courage of the Japanese soldiers , " she admits . They were also deeply impressed with the idea that the Chinese side was militarily incompetent . She remembers that when the kids played soldiers in school , the losers would often be ridiculed as " Zhi Na [ Chinese ] troops , " indicating how inept they were .  
" Starting from late 1994 , as the global economy recovered , demand increased greatly , and this brought sharp rises in the international prices of some agricultural and industrial raw materials , including petrochemical feedstocks , textile fibers , paper pulp , grains , basic metals and so on . Price rises in Taiwan are part of a global chain reaction , " says Liu Fang-jung , a specialist researching prices at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
But there are plenty of negative examples which can serve as a warning : in the late 1970s under the Carter administration , the United States ' budget deficit increased massively and inflation went into double figures for several years running . Unemployment rose sharply and economic growth stagnated , creating the dreadful problem of " stagflation . "  
" Archaeological sites in Taiwan have flaked tools like these from the paleolithic to the late neolithic eras , " notes Liu . From the standards of craftsmanship in their jade and decorative jewelry , it is clear that these people of ancient times were not without skill . However , it appears that as far as implements for daily use are concerned , their attitude may well have been " it 's enough if it 's usable . "  
Based on his previous research work and on the finds at the ongoing test dig , Liu Yi-chang can offer a general description of the first Puli-ites - - " Tamalin Man " - - living 2400-1700 years ago . They were a late neolithic people who used flaked stone tools . From the large number of hitching stones and animal jawbones it can be inferred that they knew fishing and agriculture .  
In the late 1940s , the then bustling and cosmopolitan Shanghai rejoiced at having survived World War II relatively unscathed . But when the red tide of communism flooded through China , it marked the end for the city : foreign and Chinese entrepreneurs alike were swept out through its gates and their assets seized by the state .  
Another oral history of note is that of the musician and actor Liu Chin , a member of the Taiwanese opera troupe of the legendary " Ilan Ying . " Liu 's seventy-year lifespan has essentially coincided with the rise and fall of Taiwanese opera . Because Liu was very familiar with the late Ilan Ying , through interviews with Liu the character and personality of Ilan Ying are vividly depicted , yielding valuable first - hand information for future researchers studying the history of Taiwanese opera in Ilan .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
By the late Qing dynasty ( 1616-1911 ) , when Western influence spread through the Orient , the pressure from internal strife and external aggression reduced folk music to the percussion troupes which played at weddings , funerals and other such occasions . It was actually the Buddhist and Taoist monks of a few large temples who preserved the tradition of larger scale performances , such as the drum music of Chenghuang Temple in Xi'an , or the wind and percussion playing of the monks of southern Jiangsu .  
They have great vitality and are adapted to hostile conditions . The pine seeds grow wherever they fall : in cracks in rocks , on precipices . Thus they appear in tenacious postures , even clinging crazily to sheer crags . In late Autumn , when other trees have shed their leaves and the flowers have all withered , often all that is left is the " lone pine on a winter ridge . "  
In fact , in both late 1994 and the latter half of 1995 , the Taiwan stock market index surpassed 7000 . Unfortunately , it fell due to a series of events : President Lee 's visit to the US , the consequent deterioration of relations between Taiwan and mainland China , China 's threatening missile tests , and the turbulent presidential elections in Taiwan . These caused people to buy US dollars , sucking capital out of Taiwan , and stopping the market .  
The Academia Sinica is quite confident in stating that researchers of early and medieval imperial Chinese history , for instance , can regard the on-line Twenty-Five Books of History as primary sources . For researchers of late imperial China from the Song dynasty on , because there are abundant historical materials , the materials of this archive are not the only ones available , but they certainly should not be overlooked .  
In the records of the late Eastern Han , the " Guanglingsan " was listed as folk music current in the Han and Wei regions , but in the records of the Song , it says " the ' Guanglingsan ' is no longer extant . " Lin Ku-fang points out that the music of ancient China always persisted extraneous to statements whether it was extant or not ; it was preserved in a state so that at times it was hidden , at times evident .  
In the late Ming dynasty , it is said that the salt merchants of Yangzhou graced their great halls with mechanical nudes . The export porcelain of Guangzhou is adorned with grossly distorted depictions of the crucifixion and naked missionaries chasing peasant girls . Who knows , then , what clever tricks Chambers ' rich business acquaintances in Guangzhou might have wanted to show off when trying to impress the Westerner ?  
Although the traditional robe-and-vest has virtually disappeared , the comfortable Tang suit has survived , and remains a formal wear choice for a select few . Originally , the Tang suit was a term foreigners used , in a sweeping way , to describe all Chinese fashion . In fact , what people have over time come to define as the Tang suit is something that was created in the late Qing and early Republican era among the common people .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
In late 1928 , undeterred by Japanese obstruction , Zhang resolutely decided that the northeast should change flags , thus reestablishing the unity of China after a long period of fragmentation . In September 1930 , when a military campaign by Chiang Kai-shek against two northern warlords was at a stalemate , Zhang sent a telegram pledging his allegiance to the central government , and dispatched forces from the northeast into the Beijing-Tianjin area . This put an end to the six-month-old civil war , and again helped restore national unity .  
Here in Taiwan , however , under the umbrella of the Wildlife Conservation Law , any duck hunting can only be done on the sly . But people still have a deep sense that other countries must be making a better job of things . At a " Kuantu Nature Reserve Symposium " held late last year , a wetlands expert reported how happily wild ducks and humans get along in Japan .  
The world has indeed progressed . The hasty passing of half a century has seen an improvement in material conditions , people live longer and have more to eat . Yet the most contagious disease of the late twentieth century has become " hard work . "  
In the late 1980s , the biggest crisis faced by the center was that some figures in the international agricultural community began to suggest that it would be best to establish an additional center elsewhere , to gradually supersede the Taiwan center , because of worries over the center 's future in a country that was widely barred from most other international organizations .  
But most of the travelogues which pre-date the late Ming concern travel within China . And although Journey to the West , which describes the Tang dynasty monk Tripitaka 's journey westward to collect Buddhist sutras , recounts a trip which went as far abroad as India , most of the book 's geography is made up . Kung Peng-cheng believes that Journey to the West is indistinguishable from the ancient Chinese idea of a distant journey to seek out a sage .  
Qiuran Ke Zhuan ( The Curly-Bearded Stranger ) is a Tang-dynasty romance set in the late Sui , written by Du Guangting ( 850-933 ) . In it , Curlybeard 's friend Liu Wenjing , a Daoist master , plays a game of chess with Li Shimin ( 599-649 ) , the future founding emperor of the Tang . Seeing Li 's kingly poise and countenance , the Daoist says sadly : " This match is quite lost ! "  
Though the violins may be famous and expensive , visitors usually find the automated instruments of the late 19th and early 20th centuries , on display at the entrance to the sixth floor , more interesting . When a volunteer demonstrates and explains the instruments , cranking the hand-powered gramophone , and starting up the player piano or the motor-driven " orchestra , " this old technology still proves capable of producing precise and beautiful melodies , leaving both adults and children amazed and struck with admiration for the artistic genius of our forebears .  
Chinese have been drinking tea for thousands of years , and it has long been a routine part of daily life . It appears in the traditional Chinese list of " essential items " for the kitchen , right up there with rice , soy sauce , oil , firewood , salt and vinegar . The late Lin Yutang described it as " a widespread custom that has added much color to everyday life of the people . "  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
" Today 's exam system produces people who only know how to pass exams . The ones who are no good at exams go into the dummies ' class , and those who fail are filled with a sense of inferiority ; by that time , it 's too late to save them . " Under soft yellow lamplight in a simple but elegant teahouse , a circle of listeners attentively watch the speaker in the middle .  
Laozi and Confucius both emerged late in the Spring and Autumn period , in a time of frequent warfare when the system of moral education through ritual and music of the Zhou dynasty ( 11th century-256 BC ) had collapsed , and the nobility had abandoned themselves to a life of wanton extravagance supported by ruthless exploitation of the common people .  
Earth Lord temples can often be found amid lush green expanses of paddy-field , watching over the crops and blessing them with healthy growth . P The tutelary god known as " Earth Lord " has become a bit of a celebrity of late , showing up in various TV series with his beaming smile and long white whiskers , his trademark magic ingot and ruyi scepter in hand , helping out hapless victims of mistreatment .  
Museum director Chin Hsiao-yi has announced that another major exhibit , on the culture of the Han dynasty , will travel to Taiwan in late 1999 . Relics to be displayed include selected items from the museum 's own collection , items from the famed sites of Mawangdui and the royal tomb of the Nanyue kingdom , and other items to be borrowed from various private collectors in Taiwan . This exhibit will give a clear feel for the vast sweep of Han culture . ( photo by Pu Hua-chih )  
The rapid ascent in the late twentieth century of the " 3C " industries-the capital - and technology-intensive semiconductor industry ( ICs ) , computer component production and assembly ( PCs ) , and electronic consumer goods ( ECs ) - has given Taiwan a strong hand in terms of global economic competition .  
On the flip side of the coin , the extensive and rapid development of golf courses has brought with it a sizable environmental impact , and reports of destruction of fragile hilly land areas , water consumption , pesticide use , and occupation of state land stream through the media in a constant flow . Exposure of such issues finally came to a head in the late 1980s , when environmentalists began the " movement against golf course development , " which elicited general sympathy among the public .  
On the evening of October 22 , the late autumn air of Taipei was just a little chilly , but the plaza in front of the Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Hall was hot and teeming with people . More than 10,000 music fans were crowded together , some sitting , some standing , all waiting for the concert " Nature and Hope : A Voyage to Paradise . " The show was a benefit concert for the Eden Foundation , to help those who were left physically handicapped by the Sept . 21 earthquake .  
The Confucianism of the Western Han drew on the occultist teachings of the Yin-and-Yang school of the late Warring States period ( 475-221 BC ) , advocating the principle of mutual support between Heaven and man , asserting the need for ongoing changes in political culture and rejecting the ideal of an eternal dynasty . According to this school of thought , it was the Yin-Yang formula that accounted for China 's evolution during her legendary golden age , the time of the " five emperors and three ancient dynasties . "  
Under the crisp and pleasant skies of late December , Mrs . Pu , a woman in her late fifties who lives in a military dependents ' village in Taoyuan , hastens to place her order for 40 catties ( 24 kg ) of streaky pork . When the meat arrives she chops it into one-catty strips , then steeps these in a marinade of dry-fried star anise and other spices , mixed with rock sugar , salt and Gaoliang liquor .  
Many music industry insiders in both Taiwan and the mainland agree that her former producer , the late Chang Yu-sheng , played a huge role in A-Mei 's rise to stardom . In songs like " Sisters " and " Bad Boy , " Chang masterfully brought out the " feral intensity of this small-town aboriginal girl . " Chang used distinctive lyrics , catchy tunes , A-Mei 's unique image , and an effective PR strategy to great advantage . Xiao Ke points to another example of slick promotion in the Taiwanese pop music industry .  
Shen Zhongwen , the late mainland Chinese writer , once noted that in the mainland they view Xu Zhimo as having been somewhat of the perpetual child : " It is always acknowledged that he was supremely talented , but he is ultimately regarded as being a spokesman for the decadent capitalist class , little more than a spoiled dandy . "  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
As Kung Peng-cheng sees it , modern Taiwan society is changing even more dramatically than was society in Zhu Xi 's time . It has inherited the problem of ascendant Western culture and declining Eastern culture that arose in the late Qing , and has added to this the disruptions of industrial and commercial development and rapid modernization . Yet , though Chinese have been arguing for a century about how best to cope with such changes , no very concrete systems have taken shape .  
In " Looking Back , " a documentary on women in Taiwanese politics that was filmed with support from the DPP 's Department of Women 's Affairs , the late DPP women 's affairs director Peng Wan-ju made an acute observation about Yeh : Although it was her husband 's lingering shadow that took her into politics , Yeh 's performance has gone beyond the traditional experiences of women in opposition politics , transcending the image of a victimized family member to manifest the autonomy of a female political figure in her own right .  
Did you know that , of the more than 400 foreign funds approved in Taiwan , more than 140 had an average annual return in excess of 15% over the last three years ? Meanwhile , between early 1996 and late 1999 , the annual return of the weighted index of the Taiwan stock exchange ( Taiex ) was 17% , or more than triple a one-year certificate of deposit .  
Martial arts novels first appeared in the late Qing dynasty , and largely featured fight action . The time and place in which they were set differed little from those in which people at that time lived . But the 20th century brought enormous changes , with dramatic advances in civilization , science , technology and lifestyles , and as a result the setting of the martial arts novel lost its connection with everyday life .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
This year , on the seventh day of that month , one tour bus after another wound up a twisting mountain road , bound for a gathering at the True Buddha School 's Vijaya Temple in Tsaotun , Nantou County . Later , on the 13th of the month , the Longhua Assembly of the T'ienti Teachings Association was held at the Tienchi Hsingkung Temple in Taichung . Though held late at night , it attracted thousands of devotees . Dressed in blue robes , they chanted the sect 's sutras with deep concentration .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
Pinglin Township is situated in rural southern Taipei County . Being relatively remote , the area was not developed until the late 18th century . Pinglin is a pocket of level ground set in mountain forests , whence its name , which means " forest on level ground . "  
In the late 19th century the Qing Empire , then 200 years old , could not withstand the onslaught of modern warships and cannon , and Taiwan was ceded to Japan ; during 50 years of colonial rule , however placid on the surface , Taiwanese could not escape the painful fact that they were second-class citizens . But the old motherland that was welcomed back with open arms when the Japanese departed , foisted on its " daughter " a system of social control more pervasive than any in the past .  
In the political , economic , and social arenas , the ROC is heading into a momentous period of transition , and it is the people of the nation who will decide whether things get better or worse . While the president in late May was traveling abroad and raising Taiwan 's international profile , bad news was breaking at home . The exchange value of the New Taiwan Dollar declined sharply , the latest leading economic indicators dropped off the bottom of the scale , and unemployment hit a record high .  
Born in 1960 , Lan Po-chou grew up in Miaoli County in central Taiwan and graduated with a degree in French literature from Fu Jen Catholic University .
