Kennedy 's campaign advisors had been busy beforehand , fooling around with the lecterns . They made Nixon 's a little lower and they put a bright white light on it that made him look pale and pasty faced . His popularity dropped heavily after the debate .  
He most loves early morning in the family compound , pulling aside the bed curtain and the mosquito net , walking out of the room in the entrancing shafts of sunlight , turning into the interior hall , then going through the exterior hall into the forecourt . To this day he can not forget that graduated sensation of layers and the harmonious streams of light they created .  
We 're constantly seeing cases of leaders being rejudged in the light of history , finding they may have been strong in ability but were weak in morals , or vice versa . Inter-level communicationQ : In your book you analyzed the main cause for the decline of China through the ages and concluded that it lay in the rift between the upper and middle levels and between the middle and lower ones . Is cross-level interaction and communication really that difficult ?  
Perhaps adult fireflies , who use their light to match up with their spouse , have grown dazzled and dazed by the streets lined with lights . With potential mates lost in the glare , they live celibate lives .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
Country feeling in the city : At the 1990 Taipei Lantern Festival sponsored by the Tourism Bureau , the sculptor Yang Ying-feng used science and technology to add to the festive atmosphere by creating a giant stainless steel dragon that featured music , dry ice and a changing laser light show . The traditional lanterns at Lung Shan Temple in the city 's Wanhua district likewise attracted thousands of visitors .  
In 1982 , domestic production had fallen to unacceptably low levels and the government had to change its economic strategy to one of developing agriculture and light industry , while emphasizing exporting for foreign exchange . Individual entrepreneurs were allowed to organize factories along the lines of cooperative production , and some family-style small businesses were also freed from restrictions , providing the Chinese with a lifeline .  
Because the ozone layer can absorb ultraviolet light from sunlight and block out most of the radiation harmful to life on earth , as the protective function of this layer is weakened , the incidence of diseases related to unltraviolet rays , such as skin cancer or cataracts , rises dramatically ; the immune systems of animals become repressed ; plant growth stagnates ; and it even leads to a drop in agricultural production and mass deaths in aquatic life .  
Slowly the indistinct and rough forms take shape and gain focus , and the audience is absorbed into a world of shadow and light . In a trance they are projected through a deep , dark time tunnel and their grey hair turns black , their shriveled skin youthful and taught , and their cloudy eyes sparkling . Here their bodies ' movements are lithe and sharp and their feet have an itch to get up and tango .  
The dig report from that time pointed out that there were two cultural levels at the site . The pottery discovered in the upper layer had writing , and brass implements had also been unearthed , so that layer seems to be from the Chou dynasty . But the lower layer was entirely from a stone tool culture . The black and light yellow pottery that was found was innovative in shape and of very high quality in technique , meaning that it must have been " an important stage in high antiquity . "  
In an old house : It was actually just by chance that this valuable piece ever came to light : One day two years ago , 24-year-old Wu Chung-wei was driving to Hsinchuang when he got confused and lost his way . At Yenping North Road he came across a long disused and damaged railroad workers ' dormitory .  
As these stocks have hit the market one after another , large amounts of old Pu'er tea have once again been seeing the light of day . These warehouse clearances started selling off this Pu'er tea at rock bottom prices . Ironically , when his old Pu'er tea hit the market , the Hongkongese did n't seem much interested , but the Taiwanese tea connoisseurs regarded it as " the second coming . " They were finally able to taste that gentle , pure and sweet flavor of an " organic antique , " and they were hooked .  
Twisting around rivers , green mountains and verdant valleys , the railway accompanies the ample and profound Pacific in an interlude when it runs parallel to the coast , occasionally crossing paths with the coastal highway . The railway winds a circuitous path around the mountain peaks , ducking in and out between pitch black shadow and shimmering light .  
It grows on the Hengchun peninsula by the Central Mountain Range in the far south of the island , and also on Orchid Island ( Lanyu ) to the east of Taiwan . This pure powdery white flower which blooms in great numbers is sometimes called the Taiwan Amah because of the similarity in sound of its scientific name , Phalaenopsis Amabilis . Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
When she is on stage interpreting , her speech is crisp and accurate , her laughing voice is bold and light hearted . The gender-neutral black and white tuxedo she wears gives an indistinct impression of her capability and straightforwardly effective style .  
The path was built along the playful , light current of the crisp , green Shakatang River . The little trail runs not far above the river bed . After catching sight of such an unpolluted river , who can resist the temptation to leap into the bubbling waters and swim ?  
As you move on , do n't neglect the field of small white flowers . This area was mostly Taiwan paulownia , and these are the flowers of that plant . The explanatory placard says , " A beautiful melody is unforgettable . " It is only when you read the commentary that you know that this wood is excellent material for pianos or violins because it is light , soft , and does not burn easily .  
In light of the current situation , the country will need professionals skilled in R &amp; D , foreign languages and simultaneous interpretation ; people who are possessed of an international perspective and are also familiar with the characteristics of international markets ; as well as practical personnel who have a good grasp of such aspects as finance , transportation , and communication in the operation of international business .  
At first the tile facing was very dark in color , but it later became more pale , evolving toward the international fashion for white exteriors . The High Court building , completed in 1934 , with its light green tile facade on the second and third stories , can be seen as a turning point .  
Nearly all the flower truck show proprietors were reluctant to be interviewed , especially those who provided " extra spicy " evening shows . In order to hunt them down . we resorted to the help of folklore expert Huang Wen-po , who has long observed the flower truck shows . Our car was rushing through the pitch dark salt fields and farmland , aiming toward the far-off impromptu show grounds , where neon light flashed and music reverberated in the air .  
From the international perspective , the global economy has been dragging along at a low ebb for some years now . There have been many reports of layoffs , salary cuts , and plant closings , even for established multinational giants . It was only in the middle of 1994 that light showed at the end of the tunnel , and the turnaround that is making everyone so pleased only really began then .  
Each piece displayed a different character , depending upon the light , shape , and coloring . Each had a different story to tell , from cool and aloof to hot and passionate . People discovered to their great delight that the world of glass is a varied and colorful place .  
The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs . Some are bearing little palanquins in which are seated statues of the village gods ; they excitedly crowd around Matsu 's seat of honor as it moves its way forward .  
Through their goggles , a clear and peaceful ocean world spans before them . Group after group of light blue light yellow and light green stony coral grow from the sandy sea bed . Red and green algae are scattered about . Thus begins their trip through this " ocean flower garden . "  
Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by . Menacing lionfish , covered with what seem to be thorns and claws , swim along face down . Upon seeing human divers - - what strange creatures ! - - sea snakes swim by and touch their flippers . . . .  
For example , to get his patients to release their emotions , he uses the Buddhist tantric " methods for seeing and thinking " as well as methods making use of modern physics that involve light , heat and magnetism . He teaches patients to use deep meditation to focus their energy on the part of the body that is uncomfortable in daily life . He also uses yoga to dispel accumulated depressed energy through relaxing the body .  
Off to the right , light green squares are inlaid amidst dark verdant patches of mango trees and sparkling streams running through gorges . This is where we plan to land . Off to the left , the little spot of white amidst the puffs of smoke and dense green is Saichia Village . When you lift your gaze to the horizon , your field of vision takes in Kaoshu , Chishan , and Pingtung .  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
On Mid-Autumn Festival in August of this year , with a light breeze and misty rain passing through the darkened evening sky , the sound of Chang Cheng-chieh 's violin resonates through the air outside the Confucius Temple in Taipei . Every morning , before the sky has lightened Father takes his lunchbox and rides off on his bicycle Leaving his abode , he heads to the river . . . . The unadorned but moving voice of poet Hsiang Yang weaves itself in and out of the violin strains , embroidering a romantic atmosphere . . . .  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
Bare earth and mud-brick buildings strongly reflect all three wavelengths , often showing a grey-white color . Water , on the other hand , strongly absorbs all three colors , so it appears as black in the satellite image . Meanwhile , verdant land comes out in red ( because , generally speaking , vegetation most strongly reflects near infra-red light ) , while cities appear in green .  
After the brief upturn in the first quarter of last year , the monitoring signal score slid from its peak level - - the " yellow-red light , " which indicates a booming economy - - through the " green light " which indicates moderately strong economic activity , past the rather sluggish " yellow-blue light , " and all the way to the worrisome " blue light " !  
" The artistic aura of Hou Hsiao-hsien 's The Puppet Master was similar in lighting and hue to that of the 17th Century Dutch painter Rembrandt . It needs to be illuminated with excellent facilities , " says Chiao . When screened in inadequately equipped theaters , the film is transformed into a murky block . The situation is even worse on a television set , whose ability to differentiate between strong and soft light is considerably inferior .  
It took only half the anticipated amount of time to get from initial design to mass production , greatly increasing efficiency . When this plane came onto the market , many people remained skeptical , and there was quite a controversy when some defects came to light after formal flying had begun . However , it turned out that the cause was a loose door , and there was no threat to flight safety .  
" Actually , calligraphy is a kind of exercise that fluctuates between fast and slow , relaxed and tense , light and heavy , lifting and pressing . When you wield the brush , you must direct your qi to have a good effect .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
Seed boxes recreate the natural environment with artificial day and night and corresponding temperature changes , after which " winter " arrives , and the seeds are stored at low temperatures . The process can not be hurried , and it demands far more patience of the silviculturists than propagating the Taiwan red cypress or Taiwan cypress , whose seeds ' dormancy can be broken in a week or two given adequate water and light .  
In keeping with this principle , any enclosed space can be made into a " pinhole camera " by piercing a small hole in it . Rays of light passing through the pinhole cause a vertically and laterally inverted real image of the object in view to fall onto the surface opposite it , as illustrated in the diagram above .  
Tall and handsome , young and enchanting , they nevertheless frequently go through an entire year without seeing the light of day . They sleep during the day and go out at night . They live only indoors , underneath light-bulbs , and for this reason , when one pays close attention to them , their faces always seem a little pale , their voices are scratchy , and faint bags can be seen under their eyes . . . .  
One of his own specialties is a " galan-tine , " in which many strips of meat are bound together into a long loaf . To stew the meat , instead of the traditional sachet of strong spices , Kao only uses a few pods of star anise and a dash of Sichuan peppercorns and black pepper . To make up for the missing spices he adds rather more spring onions , ginger and garlic , to give the meat more of the light aroma of fresh vegetables .  
The Chinese narcissus ' graceful poise in the water inspired Yang to call it his " guest who floats on the waves . " For him , the light yellow and pale white double-flowered " Delicate Jade " daffodil represented the true narcissus .  
Some legislators spoke on behalf of those involved , while others feared they would be branded as colluding with special interest groups . Nobody budged an inch . Thus a law that seemed simple on the surface was repeatedly delayed . Were it not for Mother Ko 's undaunted spirit and efforts , who knows when the compulsory insurance law would have seen the light of day .  
At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
The Amita Sutra also notes that the Kingdom of Paradise contains the Seven Treasure Pond which brims over with the Water of Eight Deeds and Virtues , and the bottom of the pond is covered with gold dust . . . . The lotuses here are as big as carriage wheels , and the blue flowers give off a blue light , the yellow flowers a yellow light , the red flowers a red light , and the white flowers a marvelous scent .  
After returning from New York with his MFA degree and restarting the Kuang Huan Dance Circle , Liou drew upon his extensive practice of taijiquan , qigong and yoga , and made " qi , " " body " and " mind " the troupe 's new guiding principles-when free circulation of the qi ( breath or vital energy ) is achieved , a person becomes light and nimble , and develops a greater sensitivity toward nuances of space and time ; body refers the physical body , and mind to one 's thoughts , will and intentions .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
The grandfather of the group feels that traditional puppet theater is rich in meaning , and it is a shame no one wants to learn it today . But , he also has praise for high-tech special effects that have light rays blasting out of the characters ' hands , calling them electrifying and progressive .  
In 1947 , scientists at General Electric discovered quite by accident that their synchrotron accelerator was radiating a thin layer of light . This light comprised large amounts of infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation and X-rays . Furthermore , it was 10,000 times brighter than the light created in traditional X-ray tubes . Virtually any substance or fine structure could be viewed very clearly under its radiation .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
The fundamental principles behind the operation of a synchrotron are based in electromagnetic theory : when electrons moving at near the speed of light are subjected to a magnetic field , they can then be deflected to create strong radiation in a tangential direction-namely , synchrotron radiation .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
In the deep of night the flowers might be sleeping , but as every minute of spring is to be treasured like gold , why not light some candles and spread some lanterns to illuminate a night-time banquet , and pass the time in their company ?  
Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon . Their almond-shaped pupils , which change shape in shifting light , are eerie enough , without even considering that their eyes may give off a green luminescence ( from reflected light ) . And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
Leaving behind the " real virtuality " of Taitien Temple 's heaven , the lush and verdant mortal world around us is vibrant with the sound of cicadas , and a light breeze caresses our skins . The ticket seller dozes peacefully after eating his packed lunch . Is he roaming through heaven in his dreams ?  
In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
At dawn , as the first sliver of the sun 's disc rises out of the sea , its rays strike the specially designed large windows of " Lion 's Kingdom . " Inside , several thousand stone lions have passed the night in lonely silence , but suddenly their round , staring eyes sparkle and come alive . As the exhibition room turns from darkness to light , the contours of their bodies , cold and hard in the blackness , become clear-cut and vital .  
He compares the rage for the beads to the scams involving the charlatan Buddhist master Song Chi-li who sold doctored photographs of light emanating from his head or the enormous sums spent on Buddha pedestals by the Taiqimen sect . " Strange beasts , " he says , " come out during times of social crisis . " Modern people , with their numerous desires , are hard to satisfy and often lack peace and happiness .  
In order to create space and support in international relations , Vincent Siew has visited Southeast Asia numerous times since accepting the post of premier . During the financial meltdown , it became evident that in light of Taiwan 's close links to the financial system of Southeast Asia , we must at all times keep a friendly hand extended in that direction .  
One tea setting presents a vision of layers of purple ; a vegetable basket off to the side lends a bucolic touch . Another is coffee colored with a touch of grey , setting a light and frisky mood . And there is also a setting which is entirely blue , the individual pieces of teaware looking like cool observers standing off to one side .  
Bridging the ancient and the modern Having painted ladies of the Han and Tang dynasties , Lee Su Yue then traveled back to the present , treating images of women more familiar to her . She uses light ink to sparsely sketch their fine appearances , with distant moods to transmit the different character of each subject .  
Some even say that light is emitted . In addition , in observing the statistical data , Chen also noted that the electrical currents and electromagnetic waves both have very regular directional characteristics . " This is exactly what is described in The Yellow Emperor 's Canon of Internal Medicine when it speaks of the movement of ' meridian chi ' and ' subtle nutritious chi ' along the 12 channels .  
In now-democratic Taiwan , there are virtually no linguistic taboos . Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan . Often , after just touching on the issue of language , surveyors received such contentious responses as " There 's no need to ask any more questions , just fill in all the blanks with ' Taiwanese ' ! "  
In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .  
Their owners are not only required to provide them with sufficient food and drinking water and a safe living environment with adequate shelter , air and light , but must also prevent them suffering unnecessary disturbance , abuse or injury . Animals must not be subjected to fear or pain when being transported , and they may only be slaughtered by humane methods which cause the least possible suffering .  
Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
The center of Hsinchu City has recently had a makeover . The old moat , which lay neglected for many years , crosses the city like a blue sash , lined with grassy levees and neatly laid footpaths . As you stroll in the shade of the trees , the leaves overhead stir in the summer breeze , and the sunshine dapples the ground with flecks of dancing light like little imps frisking at your feet .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
It was here that Yen Tsang-po , who has long been a leading light among Taiwanese geologists , discovered sedimentary rock dating back 200 million years , the oldest ever found in Taiwan . An analysis of what he found tells us the basic story of Taiwan 's formation . For untold eons , what is now Taiwan lay upon the ocean floor collecting sediment that had been washed out to sea from the Asian mainland .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color . As a result of these efforts , however , he later developed cataracts and lost his sight .  
Liu Shao-tang , who in the course of his life rescued or brought to light countless quantities of Republican-era historical materials , and was variously described as " single-handedly the equal of a nation " and " head of the ' unofficial Academia Historica , ' " never sought fame or fortune , and was always affable , cordial and sincere .  
In response to Lin 's accusations , Chiou I-jen , director of Chen 's national election campaign headquarters , said that Lin was engaged in slander pure and simple . In fact , explained Chiou , the entire matter was very easily explained . Chen Chin-tsai and Chen Tien-fu used Chen Shui-bian 's name without authorization to defraud Tan Kok Ping . This crime came to light long ago , and Chen Chin-tsai admitted under questioning that he had forged Chen Shui-bian 's signature .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
For instance , nowadays when one sees a Chinese-style roof with upswept eaves , the red beam high up in the middle is actually made from a tube of compressed paper . The light , cheap paper tube is wrapped in a layer of gauze and covered in red paint . Unless you actually tapped it , you would n't know it was paper .  
In a design which draws on the spirit of the gardens of Suzhou , just inside the entrance the wall is pierced high up by a carved wooden ornamental window in a rhombus pattern , which lets light shine on the sumptuously painted panels of the high caisson ceiling , to impart a sense of intricate workmanship and opulence .  
You too can go out of your door , round the corner and into a sumptuously decorated Chinese restaurant , where , under the dim light of a palace lantern , amid wooden screens carved with birds and flowers , you can savor the refined flavors of a Chinese meal served on elegant blue-and-white porcelain tableware , and fulfil your own dream of China .  
From its perch on the tree , it quietly faced the rain , standing tall and straight and getting drenched . The eagle looked exactly like a philosopher deep in thought . The eyes of the birders never fail to light up at the mention of this lonely eagle .  
And despite the surrounding hubbub , when the chiming guitar of the first track " At the Begin " welled up , accompanied by the sound of sea waves , my thoughts were quickly carried off to a beach at dawn , leagues away on the northeast coast of Taiwan , or a broad stretch of deep blue flooded with the sparkling silver light of the moon , possessed of nothing but the warmth and calm of the ocean , completely submerged in an instant .  
12 . He found the temple by the light of the snow . Once inside he jammed a rock against the door to keep it shut , and tried to make himself comfortable . The temple was damp and draughty , and Lin could n't sleep . He chewed on the dried beef , sipped at the liquor and waited for dawn .  
During his four-and-a-half years in Paris Hsia lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room to stand up in . He supported himself doing miscellaneous jobs , working on people 's houses and restoring furniture . Times were tough , but it was during this period that he found what he had been probing for in his use of line , and started on the " fuzzy people " phase of his output .  
Like a compassionate bodhisattva , a pensive director who paces the corridors of history with head bowed uses the lens of his heart to lovingly reveal souls left trembling and abandoned by war , in the spaces where light and darkness overlap . In the mind of veteran Taiwanese-language film director Hsin Chi , the muffled voices of " men without a motherland " chant in repetitive chorus .  
This elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about French films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined European life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing . Who would have thought that a stream of bitterly painful childhood memories would flood through his book-memories that came as a complete surprise even to friends who know him well .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
It is one a.m . and the rhythms of techno music pulsate through a pub in the Hsinyi commercial district . Young people , filled with perhaps more than simple youthful energy , some wearing white gloves or waving fluorescent light sticks , bop around on a tiny dance floor bathed in black fluorescent light . Waving their hands in time with the music , they look like they are conducting some sort of intense pantomime .  
The architecture of the temples is of the eastern Fujian style , with granite walls and featuring colorful , intricate decorations , in sharp contrast to the plain buildings around them . Squatting in the entrance of a temple on a hillside , looking out across the sea-which shines golden in the light of the setting sun and is dotted with little fishing craft-one feels a strong sense of the endless ebb and flow of history .  
Seafood in Matsu has an enticing appeal of its own , while also being characteristic Fuzhou cuisine ( one of the eight main branches of Chinese cooking ) in general . The taste is fresh , light and tender , with sweet and sour flavors and an emphasis on soup seasoning .  
Then , in the 1930s , Bell Laboratories in the US detected radio waves coming from the Milky Way galaxy , and researchers became aware that there are many signals in the universe that are invisible to the naked eye . Some of these electromagnetic waves can pass through dust clouds that block visible light , and can thereby reveal many unknown celestial worlds .  
In 1996 Chou read an article about oceanographic research in which the writer , inspired by everyday experience , described how even in a closed room with no direct light source , scattered sunlight ( " ambient light " ) entering the room and striking objects is reflected into people 's eyes to form images , so that people in the room can still see each other .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
Born in 1960 , Lan Po-chou grew up in Miaoli County in central Taiwan and graduated with a degree in French literature from Fu Jen Catholic University . Motivated by a deep interest in Taiwanese history , during the late 1980s Lan began to work for Ren Jian Magazine , whose main mission was to bring to light hidden aspects of society . As a writer for this magazine he laid the foundations for his latter fieldwork and investigative reports .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "

The difficulty experienced by international organizations and Governments to update their respective instruments was recognized , but it was recalled that the Recommendations have been developed and are kept up to date in the light of technical progress , the advent of new substances and articles and the exigencies of modern transport systems , and therefore there would be a risk for the Recommendations to become obsolete or not adapted to the technical progress if a four-year interval period was adopted .

In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .

The Committee considered that the mandate received from the General Assembly did not require an opinion on bilateral issues between member States , which is why it makes no statement on the specific measures adopted by the Government of the United States of America in relation to Cuba , such as the embargo imposed for over three decades , while nevertheless noting that such measures raise legal questions in the light of the norms established in articles 18 and 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States ;

As for previous thematic discussions , the Committee had invited , in the light of article 45 of the Convention , representatives of United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies , and other competent bodies , including non-governmental organizations , media representatives , research and academic organizations , and children to contribute to the discussion and provide expert advice on the topics identified .  
While this new instrument has no binding character , it rests on a firm international legal basis , most particularly on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea , 169 and also on the 1972 London Convention , particularly in the light of its forthcoming amendment , and on the numerous regional instruments for the protection of the marine environment against land-based activities , including most recently the revised Protocol on Protection of the Mediterranean Sea from Pollution by Land-based Sources and Activities ( March 1996 ) .  
In the light of current priorities , particular attention should be given to countries that make a significant , generally recognized contribution to the strengthening of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and effective efforts to strengthen regional and global security by carrying out their obligations under the major disarmament agreements and treaties in this area .

Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
In our world of interdependency and in the light of the vital need to protect a core of fundamental norms of international law , States can no longer afford to retrench behind traditional notions of sovereignty , concepts of cultural relativism , disparities in national legislation and independence of national courts to plead non-implementation of international obligations , particularly where these are aimed at protection of the individual .  
Thus , the special measures announced by ST / SGB / 282 and set out in ST / AI / 412 were developed with the objective of achieving for women equality of opportunity to participate , in the light of the established fact that , since the earliest days of the Secretariat , men colleagues have always far outnumbered their women colleagues at the Professional and , particularly , at the decision - and policy-making levels .

The latest initiative to Judaize East Jerusalem with the building of a new Jewish settlement on Arab land in Jebel Abu Ghneim , in a highly symbolic place , is a deliberate provocation in the light of the relevant resolutions adopted by overwhelming majority of the international community at the two urgent meetings of the General Assembly and at its emergency special session .  
In the light of existing realities in the disarmament process , in which international instruments are still under discussion and various questions are under negotiation , my delegation recommends allocating more time for concrete measures to be implemented in this area and suggests that it would be convenient to postpone the date of the fourth special session devoted to disarmament to a later time , perhaps until the year 2000 .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
Inspired by the purposes and principles of the Damascus Declaration , and on the basis of the role played by member States in promoting Arab solidarity , advancing the interests of the Arab nation and safeguarding joint national security ; in response to current requirements , and in the light of international and regional developments , particularly with regard to the peace process , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs affirmed their absolute commitment to work in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Arab Summit Conference held in Cairo from 21 to 23 June 1996 .  
Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain practical disarmament measures , such as , inter alia , arms control , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , confidence-building measures , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants , demining and conversion , often is a prerequisite to maintaining and consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective rehabilitation and social and economic development ,  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly .

The Committee decided not to take a position at the current time on future policy regarding the cycle of amendments after 2001 , since several experts thought it preferable to reconsider the question in 1998 in the light of the progress made in the global harmonization of systems of classification and labelling of chemicals and in the process of restructuring the various modal instruments concerned on the basis of the model regulations .

This article _ which the bulk of legal doctrine considers as jus cogens _ requires the observance of judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples during a civil war and , in the light of case law arising from international conflicts , should apply all the more so when the threat to the life of the nation is less serious .

The facts that have come to light since this aircraft was first brought into use , which are set forth in our aforementioned letter , and the ill repute the aircraft has acquired from its past espionage activities in various parts of the world , make it incumbent upon the United Nations to re-examine the question of using an aircraft that is being employed by the United States of America in a coercive manner to violate Iraq 's airspace and to spy on Iraq for purposes other than those of the Special Commission .

Nonetheless , it wishes to express its concern that , in light of the considerable social and economic problems facing the country , insufficient efforts are being taken by the State party to devise preventive strategies to ensure that such problems do not become more prevalent , thereby endangering future generations of children .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent .

While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .

One issue that warrants special attention relates to the new firms which have been operating in several countries and whose formal lawfulness , in the light of the relevant national and international legislation , is not open to question , as they are covered by the gaps and loopholes that would prevent their activities from being classified as mercenary stricto sensu . 
In the light of mutual suspicions and the weak administrative , social and economic environment , the implementation of the peace agreement was a complex and fragile process , which required a continuous commitment on the part of the signatories and the extensive support of the international community .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
Based on a peoples own efforts , the strategy of rapid economic and social progress can not be deduced from single models or rigid formulas : it must be drawn up in the light of national conditions and characteristics and necessitates a commitment on the part of each State and the cooperation of all States .  
In light of such demands , committee membership will be feasible only for governmental officials paid by their national authorities ( a situation unlikely to guarantee either independence or expertise ) , academics subsidized by their Governments ( since in todays climate of budget cuts and a user-pays approach most universities are unlikely to be prepared to subsidize international service for half the year ) , or retirees .  
Upon inquiry , the Committee was also informed that constant use related to operational activities of the Force , coupled with the extensive distances over rough mountainous roads , have resulted in vehicles registering well above the standard replacement criteria - these being 5 years or 120,000 km for civilian-pattern vehicles , jeeps , light trucks and minibuses ; 8 years or 135,000 km for ambulances , medium or heavy buses , and trucks up to 4 tons ; 10 years or 250,000 km for heavy buses and trucks , and truck tractors over 4 tons .  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
And yet , in the light of the precarious security situation and the lack of a functioning judicial system , compounded by the climate of political instability , more should be done if the international community \ x { e5b8 } hard-won achievements are to be made irreversible .  
Algeria stated that , in the light of the need to provide States with effective instruments for international cooperation in the fight against organized transnational crime , it supported the spirit and principles embodied in the draft framework convention and hoped that such a convention could soon be adopted .

In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
As yet , however , no clear legal guidelines have been established for determining which individual instances may be considered at the international level without the assent of the State concerned ( in the light of the above ) .  
In the light of new and emerging challenges , faced with conflicting situations , the ordinary citizens of the world yearn for peace and security and aspire towards economic equity and participation in meeting their basic needs and an opportunity to live in comfort . 
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
Nonetheless , it wishes to express its concern that , in light of the considerable social and economic problems facing the country , insufficient efforts are being taken by the State party to devise preventive strategies to ensure that such problems do not become more prevalent , thereby endangering future generations of children .  
In light of the Committees view that further efforts are required to ensure that the Convention is used as a political tool and a framework for action on behalf of children , the Committee recommends that future national and local programmes of action on children incorporate policies , programmes , aims and goals reflecting the principles and provisions of the Convention .  
In light of article 44 , paragraph 6 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and the written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .

Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
Less expensive than major conventional weapons , ready to use without extensive prior training , particularly against civilians , and fit for transport on a person , pack animal or light vehicle , small arms and light weapons are often the weapons of choice in such situations .  
Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .  
Given the serious consequences of the problem as described above , this is a promising time to analyse the small arms and light weapons in use in recent conflicts , the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer , as well as to recommend to Member States , regional organizations and the international community as a whole , particularly as represented by the United Nations , practical measures to prevent and reduce the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and transfer of such weapons , with a view to diminishing their role in exacerbating conflicts .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
The Government of China maintains that sovereign equality , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs and other norms governing international relations must be respected , and that each country is entitled to choose its own social system and mode of development in the light of its specific national conditions .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
In the light of this evidence , the Government of Cuba feels it has a moral obligation to alert the international community once again to the dangers threatening the future and stability of international relations if effective steps are not taken to eliminate the proliferation of measures such as this blockade , which , besides affecting the well-being and health of a people , attempts to limit the sovereignty of other States and to ignore the growing call throughout the world that it be lifted .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
The Meeting of the Parties shall periodically review the adequacy of the commitments of the Parties included in Annex I or acting under Article 10 , in the light of the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts , as well as relevant technical , social and economic information , with a view to achieving the objective of the Convention .

With the sporadic outbreak of local conflicts , the excessive accumulations of small arms and light weapons have not only had direct human costs , but also brought immeasurable social and economic dislocation .  
To reinforce national action , it is imperative that a regional approach be formulated to address the problem of the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons that is based on regional concerns and adopts an incremental approach .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
In the light of the above recommendations , the Special Representative urges the international community to adopt a comprehensive and systematic approach to providing financial and technical assistance to Rwanda , bearing in mind both the requirements of long-term development and the fact that the country has experienced a genocide combined with a continuing determination by the perpetrators to pursue their efforts at extermination .  
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
The FAO assessment will be forward looking , and will be carried out in the light of the basic principles and operational guidelines published by FAO in 1996 , as well as the specific elements to be considered during the development and implementation of national forest programmes , as endorsed by IPF ( see E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) .  
We note that the grave problems associated with small arms and light weapons are being discussed elsewhere through intensive and praiseworthy efforts of which Brazil is supportive and that a comprehensive consideration of this issue will be the subject of an international conference to take place no later than 2001 .  
Finally , the promotion of the security of civilians , including the personnel of humanitarian organizations , also depends on concrete , decisive and courageous measures designed to halt arms flows towards zones of instability and conflict , be they light and small-calibre weapons , more sophisticated and heavier weapons or anti-personnel mines .  
In order to prepare young people for the world of work , students 14 years of age or older from general education schools , vocational training schools or specialized secondary institutions may , with the consent of a parent or person acting in loco parentis , be recruited for light free _ time work which is not detrimental to their health and does not interfere with their studies .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .

In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of its available resources , including through international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Nevertheless , it seems to the Committee that it might be helpful for the working group to take stock of recent developments and to reassess its approach in light of these changing circumstances , with a view to providing a very valuable opportunity for the international community to ensure that the overall approach which is emerging is optimal .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .  
Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .  
It was a timely initiative , particularly in the light of the growing threat of the use of nuclear or radioactive material by irresponsible individuals or groups .  
Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
Any proposal must be examined in light of ( i ) a constrained United Nations budget which leaves no room for net growth in the organization ; ( ii ) the imperative to avoid duplication and to direct scarce United Nations system resources to activities having the greatest impact and benefits ; and ( iii ) the availability of voluntary funding . 
In fact , contrary to expectations based on previous studies , the deep drilling survey brought to light unexpected geological problems regarding the thickness of the Quaternary filling in the subsoil of the strait .

As a result , Hong Kong developed a light , specialized and efficient manufacturing base which , nonetheless , lacks technological depth and is therefore vulnerable to rising labour costs .  
The study determined that there would be no great technical difficulties in constructing an airstrip sufficient for light aircraft to make the 1,000 kilometre round trip from French Polynesia to Pitcairn . 4 A traveller to the island who posted a report of his visit on the Internet wrote that a town meeting had been held to discuss the project and support for it among residents was evident . 
The growing light pollution makes increasingly large areas of the Earth unusable for astronomical observations , but the light visible from space also represents wasted energy for hundreds of millions of dollars and is beginning to have a negative impact on the environment in densely populated areas .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list , in the light of additional information that may become available , for the purposes of identifying items that are subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .

At its fifty _ fifth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1999 / 53 , decided that the Sub _ Commission should further review , in the light of the ongoing discussions by the Commission on its working methods , the establishment of a forum on economic , social and cultural rights , to be called the Social Forum , to meet during its annual sessions with the following objectives :  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .  
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of available resources , including international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Finally , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the second periodic report and written replies submitted by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
In light of rapid population ageing and the projected demographic shifts extending into the coming century , action is necessary in the short , medium and long term .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
The Group recommends that the study on the feasibility of restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms and light weapons to manufacturers and dealers authorized by States , requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of resolution 53 / 77 E , should be completed in time for it to be considered at the international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , to be convened no later than 2001 .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict . 
The conference will provide an ideal opportunity for a cooperative partnership to be established among Governments , international and regional organizations and the non-governmental community to mobilize public and political support to address the problems associated with the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .  
In selecting the theme for the high-level dialogue , the Assembly may wish to recall that the Secretary-General had suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue , that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
In light of the foregoing , KFOR , in close consultation with my Special Representative , is developing a concept for demobilization of the KLA , offering individual members an opportunity to participate in a disciplined , professional , multi-ethnic civilian emergency corps .  
The purpose of the implementation of the gacaca system of traditional justice is laid out clearly in a recent position paper by the Government , which stated that a lasting solution to the problems of justice in Rwanda can only be achieved by putting in place a system of participatory justice to give an opportunity to the people to bring to light the full truth about the heinous crimes which were committed and to punish those responsible for those crimes .  
The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the immutable values of peace , democracy and the rule of law , of human rights , development and social justice , and bearing in mind the sovereign equality of States , the non-interference in their internal affairs and the respect for their territorial integrity .  
We believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that all countries have an obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of their own peoples in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international human rights instruments , and in the light of their respective national conditions and relevant laws .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
This distressing state of affairs is attributable largely to the impunity with which weapons manufacturers and arms exporters transfer small arms and light weapons to corrupt , unscrupulous and undemocratic regimes with track records of human rights violations and to rebel groups and anti-national elements which use these weapons to subject populations to brutal savagery for their own selfish ends . 
When we think of the incalculable number of civilian victims that these weapons claim including women , children and the elderly we realize the urgency of adopting or strengthening measures , on the national , regional and international levels , enabling us to regulate the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
These conflicts are made even more difficult by the huge rise in banditry , illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances and the uncontrolled circulation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , in a continent characterized by porous borders .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
In the light of the views expressed by the Presidents of the Administrative Tribunals , the legal advisers further considered the matter at their annual meeting in 1999 and decided to adjust their proposed amendment to accommodate the main concern expressed by the Presidents and to provide that the panel shall be composed of judges of the respective Tribunals designated by the Presidents , rather than the Presidents themselves .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .

The multifaceted scope and nature of the problem of the illicit trafficking and circulation and excessive and destabilizing accumulations and flows of small arms and light weapons implies that effective international responses must involve a wide range of measures and problem-solving approaches to address each of the factors and problems that need to be addressed .

The mission , composed of representatives of the Department for Disarmament Affairs , the Department of Political Affairs and the UNDP Cambodia Office , visited Cambodia from 23 to 30 January 2001 and concluded that Cambodias fragile peace was indeed threatened by the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons , which not only destabilized the countrys delicate political balance , but also contributed to a dramatic increase in criminal activity and the attendant insecurity of the population . 
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
It can not but be recognized that small arms are , paradoxically , those that claim the most victims , both civilian and military , given the nature of the current conflicts afflicting many countries , small arms and light weapons , apart from their undeniable advantage in terms of cost , proving to be the most adapted to the terrain and to the actions engaged in : easily transportable , they can be rapidly distributed and concealed . 
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa .

Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
To adopt and implement , in the States that have not already done so , the necessary legislative or other measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the illegal manufacture , possession , stockpiling and trade of small arms and light weapons within their areas of jurisdiction , in order to ensure that those engaged in such activities can be prosecuted under appropriate national penal codes .  
To ensure that all confiscated , seized or collected small arms and light weapons are destroyed , subject to any legal constraints associated with the preparation of criminal prosecutions , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized , and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered .  
To ensure , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , that the armed forces , police or any other body authorized to hold small arms and light weapons establish adequate and detailed standards and procedures relating to the management and security of their stocks of these weapons .  
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
To develop and implement , where possible , effective disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes , including the effective collection , control , storage and destruction of small arms and light weapons , particularly in post-conflict situations , unless another form of disposition or use has been duly authorized , and such weapons have been marked and the alternate form of disposition or use has been recorded , and to include , where applicable , specific provisions for these programmes in peace agreements .  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .

However , there is evidence that the unacceptably light sentences handed out to six individuals who pleaded guilty to involvement in the killing of three UNHCR staff members in Atambua on 6 September 2000 , and the insignificant charges and jail term handed out to a well-known militia leader , have encouraged some hard-line militia elements to plan the resumption of offensive operations designed to destabilize the situation in East Timor in the lead-up to the elections and independence .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list in the light of additional information that may become available for the purposes of identifying items that are covered under the relevant provisions of that resolution , because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
It was stated that , among the rules for interpretation , one analogous to the basic rule established with regard to treaties by article 31 , paragraph 1 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties , could be drafted to the effect that an act should be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the act in their context and in the light of its object .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
By the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged States in a position to do so to take appropriate national measures to destroy surplus , confiscated or collected small arms and light weapons , and to provide , on a voluntary basis , information to the Secretary-General on the types and quantities of arms destroyed as well as the methods of their destruction , and requested the Secretary-General to circulate this information annually to all States .  
The Ministers recalled that the illicit trade in small arms in the region is mainly associated with drug trafficking , terrorism , transnational organized crime , mercenary activities and other criminal acts , and held that crime prevention must therefore be an integral part of the approach to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . 
In the light of that request , the Government of Panama wishes to state for the record that it deems the issue under discussion to be an internal matter for the Chinese people , to be resolved through respectful dialogue and mutual understanding , and it considers that supporting this request by a large number of States Members of the United Nations in no way affects the cordial relations of friendship and collaboration that Panama aspires to maintain and strengthen with the Peoples Republic of China .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
We are fully aware of the close and complex link between terrorism , organized crime , drug-trafficking , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms and light weapons .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
The Institute , in partnership with subregional groupings of member States and in close cooperation with certain concerned civil society organizations , has been involved in implementing subregional initiatives and priorities undertaken towards responding to vital national security concerns and finding practical solutions and support with respect to the problem of illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking in small arms and light weapons . 
In the context of the international efforts being made to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and in light of the fact that countries that function as financial and banking centres have enacted laws on the laundering of the proceeds of illegal activities , the United Arab Emirates , after protracted study , has elaborated a draft law on money laundering that was approved by the Council of Ministers at its meeting held yesterday . 
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
It is unfortunate that , due to the inflexible position adopted by one delegation , responding to its own narrow national interests , the Programme could not make even a minimal reference to questions of key importance , such as those related to the unrestricted trade in and possession of small arms and light weapons and the need for these arms to be provided only to Governments or entities authorized by them .  
The draft Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons through various measures on the national , regional and international levels , and the follow-up mechanisms has established a solid basis for the international community and is a first step towards fighting the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
Lastly , it was important to note that the impunity of perpetrators was a primary obstacle to ensuring universal respect for the blue flag ; the light sentences handed down in the trial of those responsible for the savage killings of United Nations staff members in West Timor clearly sent the wrong message . 
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
Towards this objective and in the light of the gradual forward deployment of the Mission and progressive control of areas held by RUF , the critical aspects that these efforts specifically necessitate are the promotion of the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , the truth and reconciliation process , the peace-building activities of UNAMSIL and preparations for national elections . 
From this perspective and in the light of the international momentum towards achieving universal accession to the Agencys safeguards regime , we are amazed at the position of certain countries that are active and influential in the field of non-proliferation , which occasionally adopt a negative attitude towards the need to attain universal accession to the safeguards system .  This clear contradiction demonstrates the lack of credibility of certain influential countries in dealing seriously with the countries that fail to comply with the principles now enshrined at the international level .  
The functions of the Section are : ( i ) to receive evidence in a manner that can be sustained and proven in court ; ( ii ) to analyse the evidence in the light of the latest forensic developments ; and ( iii ) the expert preparation of evidence in a form that is provable in court .  
Such measures are , inter alia , collection and responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered ; confidence-building measures ; disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants ; demining ; and conversion ,  
Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures , especially with regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons , which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic development in many regions , particularly in post-conflict situations ,  
As a primary sponsor of that draft resolution , South Africa is particularly pleased that the Secretariat managed to source from existing budgetary provisions adequate funding for the conference servicing required for the first biennial meeting of States contemplated in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution , as well as for the meetings of a group of experts to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument for tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , referred to in paragraph 10 .  
The Government also reported that a supreme decree of June 2001 established the Truth Commission , whose mandate is to help shed light on the crimes and human rights violations committed by terrorist organizations and State agents , to prepare proposals on moral and material reparations for victims and their families and to recommend legal and institutional reforms as preventive guarantees .  
Recognizes that the White Helmets , in close cooperation with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and as an operational partner of the United Nations system , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogeneous teams available to the United Nations , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number , growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that , should it adopt draft resolution A / C . 2 / 56 / L . 78 , net additional appropriations up to $ 1,220,700 , as specified in paragraph 27 of the statement submitted by the Secretary-General , would be required at this stage , subject to the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency fund , it being understood that this amount would be adjusted in the light of the report requested above .  
Fourth , because the Commission can not possibly , for political and / or practical reasons , shed light on all countries in which there are severe and consistent patterns of human rights abuse , the Sub-Commission has used country-specific resolutions and statements by the Chairperson to help identify and put pressure on those countries which may not have received adequate attention in other human rights bodies .  
In the light of the evolving nature of the institutional support provided for the regional action programme in Asia , the Asian national focal points may agree on the modalities of reporting at the regional level , on the understanding that the task managers and hosts of the thematic programme networks of the RAP would draft the chapters of the regional report corresponding to their respective fields of activites .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
In the light of the foregoing , we call upon you to intervene on the basis of the facts set forth above and to urge Kuwait to halt its unilateral exploitation of the shared transboundary oilfields , which causes the constant migration of our oil resources , and to reach agreement with Iraq on the manner in which these fields can be exploited so as to safeguard the rights of both parties .  
In light of the circumstances prevailing in Kuwait , the E2A Panel concluded that , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , where [ non-perishable ] goods arrived at a Kuwaiti seaport on or after 2 July 1990 or at a Kuwaiti airport on or after 17 July 1990 and could not thereafter be located by the claimant , an inference can be made that the goods were lost or destroyed as a direct result of Iraqs invasion and occupation of Kuwait .  
In its E2 ( 1 ) report , this Panel considered the meaning of a threat of military action and at paragraphs 158163 , concluded that a threat of military action outside of Kuwait must be a credible and serious threat that was intimately connected to Iraqs invasion and occupation and within the actual military capability of the entity issuing the threat , as judged in light of the actual theatre of military operations during the relevant period .

Coral reefs require clear , unpolluted water in shallow seas no deeper than 30 meters , so that the symbiotic algae can absorb enough light and the coral can feed on the organisms that float by . If the water 's too hot or too cold the coral will die . Warm waters of 20-30 year round are most suitable . The salinity of the water must be above 0.25% , and so reefs can not be close to the mouth of a river .  
At the side of a cliff , a group of bright red sea fans shake with the current , and a school of light green , light purple , and light red anthids float by .

But , he also has praise for high-tech special effects that have light rays blasting out of the characters ' hands , calling them electrifying and progressive .  
In 1947 , scientists at General Electric discovered quite by accident that their synchrotron accelerator was radiating a thin layer of light . This light comprised large amounts of infrared radiation , visible light , ultraviolet radiation and X-rays . Furthermore , it was 10,000 times brighter than the light created in traditional X-ray tubes . Virtually any substance or fine structure could be viewed very clearly under its radiation .  
" In the 1970s , scientists began to realize that synchrotron radiation was the greatest light source humanity had ever yet harnessed for scientific research , " says Keng S . Liang , deputy director of the center . " And accelerators designed to produce maximum synchrotron radiation were built one after another . " These represented the second generation of synchrotron accelerators .  
The fundamental principles behind the operation of a synchrotron are based in electromagnetic theory : when electrons moving at near the speed of light are subjected to a magnetic field , they can then be deflected to create strong radiation in a tangential direction-namely , synchrotron radiation .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
In the deep of night the flowers might be sleeping , but as every minute of spring is to be treasured like gold , why not light some candles and spread some lanterns to illuminate a night-time banquet , and pass the time in their company ?  
Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon .

And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
This use of space not only lets in plenty of light , but also makes for good ventilation , because the sun shining into the central courtyard makes it warmer than the surrounding rooms and covered walkways , and so creates a natural flow of air which draws in a cooling breeze . This made the courtyard the perfect place for clan members to stay in friendly contact with each other : here the women cleaned the vegetables , made glutinous rice pastries and chatted about family affairs , and here the children did their homework and played .  
Life in a foreign land requires major adjustment . As Taiwanese senior citizens immigrate to the US to live with relatives during their twilight years , this process is filled with tears and struggle , but also brings to light their considerable resourcefulness .  
Leaving behind the " real virtuality " of Taitien Temple 's heaven , the lush and verdant mortal world around us is vibrant with the sound of cicadas , and a light breeze caresses our skins .

In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
At dawn , as the first sliver of the sun 's disc rises out of the sea , its rays strike the specially designed large windows of " Lion 's Kingdom .

Some even say that light is emitted . In addition , in observing the statistical data , Chen also noted that the electrical currents and electromagnetic waves both have very regular directional characteristics . " This is exactly what is described in The Yellow Emperor 's Canon of Internal Medicine when it speaks of the movement of ' meridian chi ' and ' subtle nutritious chi ' along the 12 channels .  
In now-democratic Taiwan , there are virtually no linguistic taboos . Yet in light of Taiwanese being suppressed for so long during the Japanese era and then again for decades of ROC rule , and in view of the tension between people of different ethnic groups and provincial backgrounds , language is a very sensitive issue in Taiwan . Often , after just touching on the issue of language , surveyors received such contentious responses as " There 's no need to ask any more questions , just fill in all the blanks with ' Taiwanese ' !

In the early days they paid little attention to decor-in fact the more ramshackle the premises , the less they cost . Before they had electric ovens , they would bake the shaobing in makeshift furnaces made from a large earthenware water pot set inside an oil drum with the top cut off . They would light a charcoal fire inside the pot , and when the coals were glowing and the pot was hot they would stick the shaobing against the inside of the pot to bake .

Little did they know that just beneath their feet lay the buried remains of an ancient culture dating back to a period ranging from 2,800 to 4,800 years ago . After several decades of research , however , archeologists have brought to light spectacular proof of an ancient " Sanxingdui culture . " Relics have been unearthed at dozens of locations around the huge Sanxingdui site , which covers a total area of more than 15 square kilometers .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
The center of Hsinchu City has recently had a makeover . The old moat , which lay neglected for many years , crosses the city like a blue sash , lined with grassy levees and neatly laid footpaths . As you stroll in the shade of the trees , the leaves overhead stir in the summer breeze , and the sunshine dapples the ground with flecks of dancing light like little imps frisking at your feet .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
It was here that Yen Tsang-po , who has long been a leading light among Taiwanese geologists , discovered sedimentary rock dating back 200 million years , the oldest ever found in Taiwan . An analysis of what he found tells us the basic story of Taiwan 's formation . For untold eons , what is now Taiwan lay upon the ocean floor collecting sediment that had been washed out to sea from the Asian mainland .  
Monet , who liked painting lotuses , worked for four years from a studio in an abandoned boat by the river at Argenteuil , where he spent long hours observing the play of sunlight on water and exploring the changing relations among light , shade and color . As a result of these efforts , however , he later developed cataracts and lost his sight .  
Liu Shao-tang , who in the course of his life rescued or brought to light countless quantities of Republican-era historical materials , and was variously described as " single-handedly the equal of a nation " and " head of the ' unofficial Academia Historica , ' " never sought fame or fortune , and was always affable , cordial and sincere .  
In response to Lin 's accusations , Chiou I-jen , director of Chen 's national election campaign headquarters , said that Lin was engaged in slander pure and simple . In fact , explained Chiou , the entire matter was very easily explained . Chen Chin-tsai and Chen Tien-fu used Chen Shui-bian 's name without authorization to defraud Tan Kok Ping . This crime came to light long ago , and Chen Chin-tsai admitted under questioning that he had forged Chen Shui-bian 's signature .  
This was largely based on the notion that so long as no physical injury results , a little pain-an " appropriate " level of punishment-is quite acceptable But the move was reversed after it came under fierce attack from commentators , the public and educational reform groups , who asserted that giving the green light to corporal punishment in this way would be a setback for educational reform .  
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in Palau . The foreign ministry delegation that visited Palau in March included private sector firms involved in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who went to investigate the investment environment .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
For instance , nowadays when one sees a Chinese-style roof with upswept eaves , the red beam high up in the middle is actually made from a tube of compressed paper . The light , cheap paper tube is wrapped in a layer of gauze and covered in red paint . Unless you actually tapped it , you would n't know it was paper .  
In a design which draws on the spirit of the gardens of Suzhou , just inside the entrance the wall is pierced high up by a carved wooden ornamental window in a rhombus pattern , which lets light shine on the sumptuously painted panels of the high caisson ceiling , to impart a sense of intricate workmanship and opulence .  
You too can go out of your door , round the corner and into a sumptuously decorated Chinese restaurant , where , under the dim light of a palace lantern , amid wooden screens carved with birds and flowers , you can savor the refined flavors of a Chinese meal served on elegant blue-and-white porcelain tableware , and fulfil your own dream of China .  
From its perch on the tree , it quietly faced the rain , standing tall and straight and getting drenched . The eagle looked exactly like a philosopher deep in thought . The eyes of the birders never fail to light up at the mention of this lonely eagle .  
And despite the surrounding hubbub , when the chiming guitar of the first track " At the Begin " welled up , accompanied by the sound of sea waves , my thoughts were quickly carried off to a beach at dawn , leagues away on the northeast coast of Taiwan , or a broad stretch of deep blue flooded with the sparkling silver light of the moon , possessed of nothing but the warmth and calm of the ocean , completely submerged in an instant .  
12 . He found the temple by the light of the snow . Once inside he jammed a rock against the door to keep it shut , and tried to make himself comfortable . The temple was damp and draughty , and Lin could n't sleep . He chewed on the dried beef , sipped at the liquor and waited for dawn .  
During his four-and-a-half years in Paris Hsia lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room to stand up in . He supported himself doing miscellaneous jobs , working on people 's houses and restoring furniture . Times were tough , but it was during this period that he found what he had been probing for in his use of line , and started on the " fuzzy people " phase of his output .  
Like a compassionate bodhisattva , a pensive director who paces the corridors of history with head bowed uses the lens of his heart to lovingly reveal souls left trembling and abandoned by war , in the spaces where light and darkness overlap . In the mind of veteran Taiwanese-language film director Hsin Chi , the muffled voices of " men without a motherland " chant in repetitive chorus .  
This elegant gent before me , dressed in a silk shirt and a dark brown woolen suit with a light , fine check pattern , savoring his coffee and chatting about French films , this classical music lover with a penchant for refined European life , looks utterly the product of a comfortable , happy upbringing . Who would have thought that a stream of bitterly painful childhood memories would flood through his book-memories that came as a complete surprise even to friends who know him well .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
It is one a.m . and the rhythms of techno music pulsate through a pub in the Hsinyi commercial district . Young people , filled with perhaps more than simple youthful energy , some wearing white gloves or waving fluorescent light sticks , bop around on a tiny dance floor bathed in black fluorescent light . Waving their hands in time with the music , they look like they are conducting some sort of intense pantomime .  
The architecture of the temples is of the eastern Fujian style , with granite walls and featuring colorful , intricate decorations , in sharp contrast to the plain buildings around them . Squatting in the entrance of a temple on a hillside , looking out across the sea-which shines golden in the light of the setting sun and is dotted with little fishing craft-one feels a strong sense of the endless ebb and flow of history .  
Seafood in Matsu has an enticing appeal of its own , while also being characteristic Fuzhou cuisine ( one of the eight main branches of Chinese cooking ) in general . The taste is fresh , light and tender , with sweet and sour flavors and an emphasis on soup seasoning .  
Then , in the 1930s , Bell Laboratories in the US detected radio waves coming from the Milky Way galaxy , and researchers became aware that there are many signals in the universe that are invisible to the naked eye . Some of these electromagnetic waves can pass through dust clouds that block visible light , and can thereby reveal many unknown celestial worlds .  
In 1996 Chou read an article about oceanographic research in which the writer , inspired by everyday experience , described how even in a closed room with no direct light source , scattered sunlight ( " ambient light " ) entering the room and striking objects is reflected into people 's eyes to form images , so that people in the room can still see each other .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
Born in 1960 , Lan Po-chou grew up in Miaoli County in central Taiwan and graduated with a degree in French literature from Fu Jen Catholic University . Motivated by a deep interest in Taiwanese history , during the late 1980s Lan began to work for Ren Jian Magazine , whose main mission was to bring to light hidden aspects of society . As a writer for this magazine he laid the foundations for his latter fieldwork and investigative reports .  
In the years that followed Lan taught himself the historian 's craft and collected a rich store of materials which , as he explains , were the origin of his latest book : " I had collected a wealth of materials waiting to be classified and arranged , but the stories of these five women provided me with the most complete source for shedding light on the true face of the female victims of the White Terror . "  
NTU 's innovative multifunctional protein chip reader uses mature optical and semiconductor technology in which Taiwanese industry is well versed , and does not require the use of a fluorescence microscope .

In its traditional form , qigui has always been quite a simple matter . You go to any temple , stand facing any one of the small sacred tortoises set out on display , light three incense sticks to respectfully inform the netherworld of your choice , and then cast the divining blocks ( two matching wooden blocks shaped like the halves of a cashew nut ) .  
Take a model of a fishing boat : The hull is white , with reflective beads attached as fishing lamps . Underneath the boat , transparent light blue acrylic has been cut to simulate ocean waves , and white cotton serves as the foam at the crests of the waves .  
His son , who is in senior high school , once reached 90 kilos in weight , and was depressed and constantly lethargic .

The blinding light reflecting off the textured surface is both mysterious and moving . Lava story Between eight and 17 million years ago , in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait , magma forced its way through fractures in the earth 's crust . The lava poured through to the surface , accumulating and covering the earth in large and small piles , creating the impressively beautiful Penghu archipelago .  
Thereafter Taiwan 's economy was transformed from relying mainly on agriculture to one dominated by light industry , and forestry lost its former importance . Forestry policy was changed from maximizing production to cutting of timber only on small areas in a planned way .  
Once you reduce its thickness to 50 nanometers , light can easily pass through it , so that it no longer reflects light . Its color changes from gold to red , and it becomes an excellent material for pregnancy test kits . Once gold is manufactured as thin as 50 nanometers , it goes from being extremely stable to being extremely volatile , allowing it to be used in many different applications as a catalyst or activator .  
" The sutra paper for sale on the market is generally dyed with the ' direct blue ' dye used for ordinary papermaking , " says Wang Kuo-tsai . " It does n't dye to a deep blue , and it tends to have a green cast .

In the light of the major changes that have occurred in the past 50 years in the sphere of human rights , it is a little surprising to recall that until very recently , and throughout virtually all mankind 's history , the absolute power to determine which rights they allowed their subjects and to establish internal mechanisms for protecting them lay with sovereigns ( monarchs , emperors , etc . ) and later with States .  
This article _ which the bulk of legal doctrine considers as jus cogens _ requires the observance of judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples during a civil war and , in the light of case law arising from international conflicts , should apply all the more so when the threat to the life of the nation is less serious .  
Those delegations stressed the importance of disseminating information on the activities of the Organization throughout the world and the strategic role played by the Department of Public Information as information disseminator in order to enhance the image of the Organization and to promote an informed understanding of the work of the United Nations among the peoples of the world , through the implementation of mandated programme activities .  3 .

The facts that have come to light since this aircraft was first brought into use , which are set forth in our aforementioned letter , and the ill repute the aircraft has acquired from its past espionage activities in various parts of the world , make it incumbent upon the United Nations to re-examine the question of using an aircraft that is being employed by the United States of America in a coercive manner to violate Iraq 's airspace and to spy on Iraq for purposes other than those of the Special Commission .  
In the light of the agreement reached in the informal consultations of the President on this subject , the Board decided , in accordance with paragraph 107 ( a ) of the Midrand final document , that it would scrutinize the UNCTAD publications policy at its sixteenth executive session , following prior consultations .

The Assembly also stressed that , in the light of the ongoing discussions on reform within the United Nations , international institutional arrangements in the area of sustainable development were intended to contribute to the goal of strengthening the entire United Nations system .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
Taking note also of the draft international declaration on the human genome and the protection of human rights , currently being prepared by the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization , which is intended to establish the principle of the fundamental unity of all members of the human family and to ensure recognition of the dignity inherent in each of them , in the light of scientific and technological developments in the areas of biology and genetics ,

Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
These populations , sometimes held hostage by armed groups bent on genocide for which an international criminal court has been set up have in turn been massacred in circumstances that need to be brought to light so that a different future can be forged .  
The facts that have come to light since this aircraft was first brought into use , which are set forth in our aforementioned letter , and the ill repute the aircraft has acquired from its past espionage activities in various parts of the world make it incumbent upon the United Nations to re-examine the question of using an aircraft that is being employed by the United States of America in a coercive manner to violate Iraq 's airspace and to spy on Iraq for purposes other than those of the Special Commission .  
The Secretary-General had , in his previous report ( A / 50 / 480 ) , suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue ; that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
In the light of the foregoing considerations and taking into account the dynamics and political importance of the subject , we have decided to instruct our Ministers for Foreign Affairs to maintain a broad dialogue on the issue , taking into account the regional interest , and to seek an understanding on the subject .  
Nonetheless , it wishes to express its concern that , in light of the considerable social and economic problems facing the country , insufficient efforts are being taken by the State party to devise preventive strategies to ensure that such problems do not become more prevalent , thereby endangering future generations of children .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent . 
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .

On the question of international drug control , he said that , in the light of the unprecedented spread of illicit drugs over the past two decades , the relevant international instruments must be implemented and the role of the United Nations must be enhanced . 
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
While the proportion of the national budget allocated to basic social sectors was still to be optimized , advances had been made in the political arena , such as the agreement by the National Assembly to convene a biennial children 's parliament , the creation of strategic alliances for children 's rights among mayors and religious leaders and the review of Senegalese legislation in the light of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .  
Calls upon relevant United Nations organs and agencies - in the light of the principles set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights - to make , within their respective mandates and fields of action , an assessment of , and to put forward pertinent conclusions on , the state of implementation and the impact of existing international human rights instruments ;

That conditionality must be perceived in a positive light : those who cooperate in good faith in the implementation of the Agreement , whether at the central , local or municipal level , can be assured of our support .  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .  
Other replies contained favourable views : the appointment of a special rapporteur was seen , in the light of article 2 of the Covenant , as a way to overcome obstacles to the realization of economic , social and cultural rights and to protect vulnerable groups such as migrants and minorities .  
Treaty bodies were encouraged to appoint individual members to liaise with specialized agencies or other intergovernmental bodies of most relevance to their respective mandate and to invite representatives of international financial institutions and other international and multilateral and development institutions to present to them an analysis of the impact of their activities on women 's enjoyment of economic and social rights in the light of international standards in general , and in relation to particular States .

While it is prepared to consider the question of a thematic debate , whose utility has yet to be proven in the light of recent sessions , my delegation nevertheless continues to believe that it would be difficult to accept the idea of adding other matters to the agenda that have no bearing on the subject matter already addressed .  
Mr . Olhaye ( Djibouti ) : The draft resolution under consideration by the General Assembly at this emergency special session , regarding the illegal Israeli actions in occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied Palestinian territory , represents , in the light of the enormous implications of Israel 's actions , a reasonable expression of concern and a minimal measure on the part of the international community .  
In this connection , UNHCR observed that in the light of the likelihood of continuing ethnic regional conflicts , the prevention of such conflicts , as well as the search for durable solutions to address the resulting displacement , will remain a major preoccupation for the international community .  
In the light of this the report argued that , with sufficient political will and the sustained implementation of a comprehensive set of policies , full employment remains an attainable objective .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies , in the light of the purposes set forth in the Declaration , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,

One issue that warrants special attention relates to the new firms which have been operating in several countries and whose formal lawfulness , in the light of the relevant national and international legislation , is not open to question , as they are covered by the gaps and loopholes that would prevent their activities from being classified as mercenary stricto sensu . 
In the light of mutual suspicions and the weak administrative , social and economic environment , the implementation of the peace agreement was a complex and fragile process , which required a continuous commitment on the part of the signatories and the extensive support of the international community .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
Based on a peoples own efforts , the strategy of rapid economic and social progress can not be deduced from single models or rigid formulas : it must be drawn up in the light of national conditions and characteristics and necessitates a commitment on the part of each State and the cooperation of all States .  
In light of such demands , committee membership will be feasible only for governmental officials paid by their national authorities ( a situation unlikely to guarantee either independence or expertise ) , academics subsidized by their Governments ( since in todays climate of budget cuts and a user-pays approach most universities are unlikely to be prepared to subsidize international service for half the year ) , or retirees .  
Upon inquiry , the Committee was also informed that constant use related to operational activities of the Force , coupled with the extensive distances over rough mountainous roads , have resulted in vehicles registering well above the standard replacement criteria - these being 5 years or 120,000 km for civilian-pattern vehicles , jeeps , light trucks and minibuses ; 8 years or 135,000 km for ambulances , medium or heavy buses , and trucks up to 4 tons ; 10 years or 250,000 km for heavy buses and trucks , and truck tractors over 4 tons .  
Convinced that in the light of the existing level of standard _ setting in the field of human rights , the primordial task of the United Nations at present is to promote universal accession to the existing international instruments and better implementation of them by all the States parties ,  
And yet , in the light of the precarious security situation and the lack of a functioning judicial system , compounded by the climate of political instability , more should be done if the international community \ x { e5b8 } hard-won achievements are to be made irreversible .

In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
As yet , however , no clear legal guidelines have been established for determining which individual instances may be considered at the international level without the assent of the State concerned ( in the light of the above ) .  
In the light of new and emerging challenges , faced with conflicting situations , the ordinary citizens of the world yearn for peace and security and aspire towards economic equity and participation in meeting their basic needs and an opportunity to live in comfort . 
In the light of current global realities , an amendment of the Charter of the United Nations was not feasible ; an independent and permanent court should therefore be established by means of a multilateral treaty .  
Nonetheless , it wishes to express its concern that , in light of the considerable social and economic problems facing the country , insufficient efforts are being taken by the State party to devise preventive strategies to ensure that such problems do not become more prevalent , thereby endangering future generations of children .  
In light of the Committees view that further efforts are required to ensure that the Convention is used as a political tool and a framework for action on behalf of children , the Committee recommends that future national and local programmes of action on children incorporate policies , programmes , aims and goals reflecting the principles and provisions of the Convention .  
In light of article 44 , paragraph 6 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and the written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .  
In the light of article 2 of the Convention , the Committee remains concerned about the persistence of discriminatory attitudes against some groups of children , especially girls and children with disabilities as well as children living in rural areas , which often results in limited access to basic social facilities such as health and education .  
Finally , in the light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted thereon by the Committee .

Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
A supportive environment needs to be established to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection , processing and dissemination , especially in developing countries , to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues through appropriate means , including high-tech information and communication infrastructure related to the global environment , in the light of country-specific conditions , using , where available , such tools as geographic information systems and video transmission technology , including global mapping . 
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
Whilst positive measures have not always been easy to implement , innovative approaches to positive measures may be politically attractive in the light of existing budget constraints and their potential to reduce the costs of achieving the environmental objectives of an MEA .  
Less expensive than major conventional weapons , ready to use without extensive prior training , particularly against civilians , and fit for transport on a person , pack animal or light vehicle , small arms and light weapons are often the weapons of choice in such situations .  
Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .  
Given the serious consequences of the problem as described above , this is a promising time to analyse the small arms and light weapons in use in recent conflicts , the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer , as well as to recommend to Member States , regional organizations and the international community as a whole , particularly as represented by the United Nations , practical measures to prevent and reduce the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and transfer of such weapons , with a view to diminishing their role in exacerbating conflicts .  
Having heard the incisive and comprehensive statement of President Arafat earlier in the day at the special session on Palestine of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference and in the light of the forthright positions traditionally adopted by the Movement on this issue , including those in the final document of the New Delhi Conference , the Committee is of the opinion that :  
The Government of China maintains that sovereign equality , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs and other norms governing international relations must be respected , and that each country is entitled to choose its own social system and mode of development in the light of its specific national conditions .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
In the light of this evidence , the Government of Cuba feels it has a moral obligation to alert the international community once again to the dangers threatening the future and stability of international relations if effective steps are not taken to eliminate the proliferation of measures such as this blockade , which , besides affecting the well-being and health of a people , attempts to limit the sovereignty of other States and to ignore the growing call throughout the world that it be lifted .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
Fourth , the content of international development cooperation must be constantly revised in the light of the new characteristics and needs of the world economy , and the effective participation of developing countries in macroeconomic policies must be strengthened . 
The Meeting of the Parties shall periodically review the adequacy of the commitments of the Parties included in Annex I or acting under Article 10 , in the light of the best available scientific information and assessment on climate change and its impacts , as well as relevant technical , social and economic information , with a view to achieving the objective of the Convention .

With the sporadic outbreak of local conflicts , the excessive accumulations of small arms and light weapons have not only had direct human costs , but also brought immeasurable social and economic dislocation .  
To reinforce national action , it is imperative that a regional approach be formulated to address the problem of the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons that is based on regional concerns and adopts an incremental approach .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
In the light of the above recommendations , the Special Representative urges the international community to adopt a comprehensive and systematic approach to providing financial and technical assistance to Rwanda , bearing in mind both the requirements of long-term development and the fact that the country has experienced a genocide combined with a continuing determination by the perpetrators to pursue their efforts at extermination .  
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
The FAO assessment will be forward looking , and will be carried out in the light of the basic principles and operational guidelines published by FAO in 1996 , as well as the specific elements to be considered during the development and implementation of national forest programmes , as endorsed by IPF ( see E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) .  
We note that the grave problems associated with small arms and light weapons are being discussed elsewhere through intensive and praiseworthy efforts of which Brazil is supportive and that a comprehensive consideration of this issue will be the subject of an international conference to take place no later than 2001 .  
Finally , the promotion of the security of civilians , including the personnel of humanitarian organizations , also depends on concrete , decisive and courageous measures designed to halt arms flows towards zones of instability and conflict , be they light and small-calibre weapons , more sophisticated and heavier weapons or anti-personnel mines .  
In order to prepare young people for the world of work , students 14 years of age or older from general education schools , vocational training schools or specialized secondary institutions may , with the consent of a parent or person acting in loco parentis , be recruited for light free _ time work which is not detrimental to their health and does not interfere with their studies .  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .

Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .

Nevertheless , it seems to the Committee that it might be helpful for the working group to take stock of recent developments and to reassess its approach in light of these changing circumstances , with a view to providing a very valuable opportunity for the international community to ensure that the overall approach which is emerging is optimal .  
In the light of ethnic hatred , propaganda and incitement to ethnic killing in the Great Lakes region of Africa , Oxfam suggested that all Governments that prohibit and condemn racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance should reinvigorate their commitment to the relevant aspects of international human rights law and international humanitarian law .

First , in the light of what we heard during our mission to Cambodia , even from some high official sources , the level of corruption in the court system and the routine subjection of judicial decisions to political influence would make it nearly impossible for prosecutors , investigators and judges to be immune from such pressure in the course of what would undoubtedly be very politically charged trials .

Among the different branches of the humanities or general baccalaureate , which is the choice of most students , the commercial baccalaureate is decreasing in popularity and technical education is still very poorly developed , in spite of being incorporated in the legislation , and particularly in the light of the training challenges for middle _ level , technical and professional personnel set by economic integration projects such as MERCOSUR .  
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
Any proposal must be examined in light of ( i ) a constrained United Nations budget which leaves no room for net growth in the organization ; ( ii ) the imperative to avoid duplication and to direct scarce United Nations system resources to activities having the greatest impact and benefits ; and ( iii ) the availability of voluntary funding .

The growing light pollution makes increasingly large areas of the Earth unusable for astronomical observations , but the light visible from space also represents wasted energy for hundreds of millions of dollars and is beginning to have a negative impact on the environment in densely populated areas .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list , in the light of additional information that may become available , for the purposes of identifying items that are subject to monitoring because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .

At its fifty _ fifth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1999 / 53 , decided that the Sub _ Commission should further review , in the light of the ongoing discussions by the Commission on its working methods , the establishment of a forum on economic , social and cultural rights , to be called the Social Forum , to meet during its annual sessions with the following objectives :  
Earlier in the present report ( para . 261 ) the Special Rapporteur noted the generalized opinion that , in the light of the situation endured by indigenous peoples today , the existing mechanisms , either administrative or judicial , within non-indigenous spheres of government have been incapable of solving their difficult predicament .  
Particularly in the light of the present poor short-term prospects for the world economy , it is of interest to explore whether the use of international measures , rather than reliance purely on domestic action , might have achieved a more positive outcome for the countries concerned and , at the same time , might have boosted global economic growth . 
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
The report indicated that in the light of those principles , all countries that had ratified the international instruments were confronted with the incompatibility that existed between the obligations they had assumed as States parties to the various agreements and the maintenance of certain traditional practices , especially since the practices had proved injurious to the physical and mental health of women and children .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .  
Finally , the Committee recommends that , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the initial report and written replies presented by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and the concluding observations adopted by the Committee .  
In light of articles 2 , 3 and 4 of the Convention , the Committee encourages the State party to continue undertaking all appropriate measures to the maximum extent of available resources , including international cooperation , to continue ensuring that sufficient budgetary allocations are provided to social services for children and that particular attention is paid to the protection of children belonging to vulnerable and marginalized groups .  
Finally , in light of article 44 , paragraph 6 , of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the second periodic report and written replies submitted by the State party be made widely available to the public at large and that the publication of the report be considered , along with the relevant summary records and concluding observations adopted by the Committee .  
In light of article 33 of the Convention , the Committee recommends that the State party take all appropriate measures , including legislative , administrative , psycho _ social and educational measures , to protect children from the illicit use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to prevent the use of children in the illicit production and trafficking of such substances .

He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
In light of rapid population ageing and the projected demographic shifts extending into the coming century , action is necessary in the short , medium and long term .  
The objectives of the joint action are : ( a ) to combat and contribute to ending the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons ; ( b ) to contribute to the reduction of existing accumulations of these weapons to levels consistent with the legitimate security needs of countries ; and ( c ) to help those regions suffering from the problems associated with excessive accumulation and spread of small arms to tackle them .  
The Group recommends that the study on the feasibility of restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms and light weapons to manufacturers and dealers authorized by States , requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of resolution 53 / 77 E , should be completed in time for it to be considered at the international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , to be convened no later than 2001 .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
Canada believes that the excessive and destabilizing accumulation and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons ( hereinafter referred to as small arms ) have now been widely recognized as an important issue affecting international as well as human security , one that demands urgent action .  
In the 1997 report , while stating that accumulations of small arms and light weapons become excessive and destabilizing when a State , whether supplier or recipient , does not exercise restraint in the production , transfer , acquisition and holding of such weapons beyond those needed for legitimate national or collective defence and internal security , notes that there is no single cause for the accumulation of small arms and their subsequent transformation into instability and conflict . 
The conference will provide an ideal opportunity for a cooperative partnership to be established among Governments , international and regional organizations and the non-governmental community to mobilize public and political support to address the problems associated with the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
The demand for small arms and light weapons is caused primarily by ethnic and religious conflict , economic and social exclusion , poor governance , lack of respect for the rule of law , lack of democratic institutions and lack of respect for human rights .  
In the interim , consultations are continuing on ways and means to implement the southern African regional action programme on light arms and illicit arms trafficking , developed at a workshop of southern African and European Union officials and experts held near Pretoria in May 1998 .  
In selecting the theme for the high-level dialogue , the Assembly may wish to recall that the Secretary-General had suggested that themes be selected in the light of the principal objectives of the dialogue , that is , to promote broader and deeper understanding of issues of a global or transboundary nature that cut across individual , regional or group interests .  
In light of the foregoing , KFOR , in close consultation with my Special Representative , is developing a concept for demobilization of the KLA , offering individual members an opportunity to participate in a disciplined , professional , multi-ethnic civilian emergency corps .  
The purpose of the implementation of the gacaca system of traditional justice is laid out clearly in a recent position paper by the Government , which stated that a lasting solution to the problems of justice in Rwanda can only be achieved by putting in place a system of participatory justice to give an opportunity to the people to bring to light the full truth about the heinous crimes which were committed and to punish those responsible for those crimes .  
The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the immutable values of peace , democracy and the rule of law , of human rights , development and social justice , and bearing in mind the sovereign equality of States , the non-interference in their internal affairs and the respect for their territorial integrity .  
We believe that it is the sacred duty of all Governments to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms , and that all countries have an obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of their own peoples in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and international human rights instruments , and in the light of their respective national conditions and relevant laws .  
Russia , as a major producer and exporter of small arms and light weapons , is carrying out a responsible policy in the area of the supply of weapons to the international market ; undertaking measures at the national level to tighten control over the export , production and supplies of small arms and light weapons ; and intensifying the fight against their illicit proliferation .  
This distressing state of affairs is attributable largely to the impunity with which weapons manufacturers and arms exporters transfer small arms and light weapons to corrupt , unscrupulous and undemocratic regimes with track records of human rights violations and to rebel groups and anti-national elements which use these weapons to subject populations to brutal savagery for their own selfish ends . 
When we think of the incalculable number of civilian victims that these weapons claim including women , children and the elderly we realize the urgency of adopting or strengthening measures , on the national , regional and international levels , enabling us to regulate the proliferation of small arms and light weapons .  
These conflicts are made even more difficult by the huge rise in banditry , illicit trafficking in narcotics and psychotropic substances and the uncontrolled circulation of arms , especially small arms and light weapons , in a continent characterized by porous borders .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
In the light of the views expressed by the Presidents of the Administrative Tribunals , the legal advisers further considered the matter at their annual meeting in 1999 and decided to adjust their proposed amendment to accommodate the main concern expressed by the Presidents and to provide that the panel shall be composed of judges of the respective Tribunals designated by the Presidents , rather than the Presidents themselves .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
In the light of the poor prospects for the internal mobilization of adequate development resources , through domestic savings and the production of adequate exportable surpluses , official development assistance ( ODA ) flows continue to be of critical importance in sustaining growth and development in LDCs .  
In the light of the fact that the Covenant is applied in HKSAR subject to a reservation that seriously affects the application of article 13 in relation to decision-making procedures in deportation cases , the Committee remains concerned that persons facing a risk of imposition of the death penalty or of torture , or inhuman , cruel or degrading treatment as a consequence of their deportation from HKSAR may not enjoy effective protection .  
Also concerned about the close link between terrorism , organized crime and drug trafficking , on the one hand , and the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons , on the other , and stressing the importance of international efforts aimed at combating them , Also welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on small arms , 101 prepared with the assistance of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms pursuant to General Assembly resolution 52 / 38 J ,  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;

On this basis , European Union support will be considered in the light of the conclusions of the meeting of the Committee on Somalia of the IGAD Partners Forum held in Rome on 19 and 20 October 1999 , and of its approach in favour of the establishment of regional governance structures based on participatory processes with the full involvement of civil society , which would provide a foundation for a future national government and for preserving the sovereignty and unity of Somalia .  
In the sense of paragraph 8 of Commission resolution 1999 / 34 , the most important legal means concern those arising from penal law as provided for in the Peruvian Penal Code ( Legislative Decree No . 635 ) which permit administrative or judicial orders to characterize and sanction acts as crimes , because it is only once criminal acts are determined as such in light of the facts that an omission to prosecute and punish can be observed to generate impunity .  
With regard to draft guideline 1.3.1 , his delegation also supported the Commissions conclusions on supplementary means of interpretation , which should be used in cases where the interpretation of the statement in the light of the treaty to which it referred left the meaning ambiguous or obscure or would lead to a result which was manifestly unreasonable .

Hence , the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries was constituted in the light of the values of peace , democracy , rule of law , human rights , development and social justice , bearing in mind the principles of sovereign equality of States , non-interference in their internal affairs and respect for their territorial integrity .  
In this light , it is pertinent to note that the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement during the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly , held in New York on 23 September 1999 , once again called on the parties concerned to strictly comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions and emphasized the need to terminate the economic , commercial and financial sanctions against Cuba .  
In the light of extensive measures under way to firmly set the University for Peace on a strong platform , adequate and proportionate financial support from various sources is required .  
In effect States should undertake additional measures , such as stepping up efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines , combating the excessive stockpiling and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , addressing the fate of children involved in armed conflicts , protecting and assisting internally displaced people and ensuring the rapid entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court .

We are confident that the Committee jurisprudence will be open to a developing interpretation of the most controversial points , in the light of the practice of other human rights treaty bodies , and also of the peculiarity of the CEDAW Convention , which provides for a wider scope of social and cultural human rights than other international instruments .  
We are particularly pleased to note the widely shared view that this optional protocol provides procedures for the enforcement of the human rights of women which are in no way less effective than the procedures available in other human rights instruments ; indeed that its provisions build on those existing instruments and should be interpreted in the light of the rules of procedure and the evolving practice and experience of the other human rights treaty bodies .  
Developing the capacity to export is particularly crucial in light of the fast expansion of international trade and the limited size of the domestic market of many developing countries .  
Moreover , in the light of the federal structure of Canada and the extensive provincial jurisdiction , the absence of any expert particularly representing the largest provinces , other than Quebec , significantly limited the potential depth of the dialogue on key issues .  
Russia firmly believes that if an overall understanding is reached in good time on the key parameters of the future CFE , this would enable the States parties to comply with the existing treaty in the light of the understanding and not resort to special procedures during the period leading up to the completion of talks on the adaptation and the conclusion of a revised treaty .  
In the light of the immense potential of space remote sensing in providing vital input for soil conservation , water resources , management , forest monitoring , land management , coastal and river basin protection , agriculture and drought management , and flood mapping and sustainable integrated development , action must be initiated to promote intensive cooperation among various countries within the region to enable them to benefit from each others expertise .  
A number of people stressed that incidents which had come to light often thanks to the watchfulness of local associations and NGOs like Greenpeace International , might represent only a tiny percentage of the waste and products which are banned from import , but which are smuggled into the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and buried there illegally .  
Furthermore , owing to insufficient procurement lead times , instead of buying 10 light and 2 medium buses budgeted at $ 397 , 000 , the Mission placed an order for an additional 21 light utility vehicles ( to be held in reserve ) and 6 light sedans at a lower total cost of $ 274 , 900 , exclusive of freight .  
In the light of the aforementioned , Lebanese law guarantees the exercise of the fundamental human rights contained in the international instruments ratified by Lebanon , free of all discrimination .  
Its dangerous waste control regulations , drawn up on the basis of the provisions of the Basel Convention embody the technical and legal principles applicable to the environmentally sound management of hazardous wastes in the light of current programmes and policies , and prohibit the import of any type of waste .  
Noting also , in this context , the increasing significance of official development assistance as an external resource for many developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , in the light of reduced private flows , and further that the overall declining trend in official development assistance is a cause for concern ,  
It is under these circumstances that Ethiopia would find it difficult to consider these latest statements by the international community , though encouraging and positive , sufficiently forthright and commensurate with the gravity of the situation we face , which is made all the more serious in light of the continuing Eritrean attempt at expanding its occupation and its war of aggression .  
In light of this , what is most appropriate now , as Ethiopia has made known repeatedly , and what is called for , to reverse what Eritrea is determined to make imminent , is the application of effective and meaningful pressure on Eritrea in all areas - political , diplomatic and economic - to force it to see reason and to give peace a chance .  
Contrary to the degrading , inhumane and brutal treatment of detainees held by the Taliban , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , in the light of the fundamental criteria of humanitarian treatment and respect for human dignity , has approached Taliban captives with care .

The licences authorizing the manufacture of small arms and light weapons could contain obligations to maintain comprehensive records subject to national verification and / or audit ( including qualifications of the licensee , the type model , calibre or gauge , and serial number of each completed firearm manufactured and the name of the purchaser and date of sale ) .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
Proclaiming its agreement to the talks , the Islamic State of Afghanistan , however , in the light of the opening paragraphs of the document , is surprised by the notion expressed in the unnumbered third paragraph , namely that the lack of positive results in bringing about an Afghan settlement is linked to the determination of the warring Afghan sides to settle the conflict solely by military means .  
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
In the light of the International Bill of Rights , poverty may be defined as a human condition characterized by sustained or chronic deprivation of the resources , capabilities , choices , security and power necessary for the enjoyment of an adequate standard of living and other civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
The expert seminar acknowledged the need for a new text that would build on existing human rights norms and standards in a manner that explicitly addressed the phenomenon of poverty , and in particular extreme poverty , that would clarify definitional issues through the multidimensional nature of poverty in the light of human rights , and that would set forth relevant operational and policy guidelines . 
The mission , composed of representatives of the Department for Disarmament Affairs , the Department of Political Affairs and the UNDP Cambodia Office , visited Cambodia from 23 to 30 January 2001 and concluded that Cambodias fragile peace was indeed threatened by the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons , which not only destabilized the countrys delicate political balance , but also contributed to a dramatic increase in criminal activity and the attendant insecurity of the population . 
While reminding all States of their existing international legal obligations in the field of disarmament , the European Union further urges those States that have not yet done so to accede to the relevant international agreements and instruments designed to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the spread of anti-personnel mines , and further to join in the global effort to prevent the destabilizing accumulation and spread of small arms and light weapons , thereby facilitating peaceful cooperation between States , which is crucial to socio-economic development .  
It can not but be recognized that small arms are , paradoxically , those that claim the most victims , both civilian and military , given the nature of the current conflicts afflicting many countries , small arms and light weapons , apart from their undeniable advantage in terms of cost , proving to be the most adapted to the terrain and to the actions engaged in : easily transportable , they can be rapidly distributed and concealed . 
At the regional level , many voices have been raised in favour of mobilizing the international community , particularly in the Bamako Declaration of 1 December 2000 , in which the African countries expressed , inter alia , their grave concern at the devastating consequences of the problem of the illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking of small arms and light weapons has for stability and development in Africa . 
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
Convinced of the need for a global commitment to a comprehensive approach to promote , at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels , the prevention , reduction and eradication of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects as a contribution to international peace and security ,  
To adopt and implement , in the States that have not already done so , the necessary legislative or other measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the illegal manufacture , possession , stockpiling and trade of small arms and light weapons within their areas of jurisdiction , in order to ensure that those engaged in such activities can be prosecuted under appropriate national penal codes .  
To ensure that all confiscated , seized or collected small arms and light weapons are destroyed , subject to any legal constraints associated with the preparation of criminal prosecutions , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized , and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered .  
To ensure , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , that the armed forces , police or any other body authorized to hold small arms and light weapons establish adequate and detailed standards and procedures relating to the management and security of their stocks of these weapons .  
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
To develop and implement , where possible , effective disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes , including the effective collection , control , storage and destruction of small arms and light weapons , particularly in post-conflict situations , unless another form of disposition or use has been duly authorized , and such weapons have been marked and the alternate form of disposition or use has been recorded , and to include , where applicable , specific provisions for these programmes in peace agreements .  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States undertake to cooperate with each other , including on the basis of the relevant existing global and regional legally binding instruments as well as other agreements and arrangements , and , where appropriate , with relevant international , regional and intergovernmental organizations , in tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , particularly by strengthening mechanisms based on the exchange of relevant information .  
States are encouraged , subject to their national practices , to enhance , according to their respective constitutional and legal systems , mutual legal assistance and other forms of cooperation in order to assist investigations and prosecutions in relation to the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
However , there is evidence that the unacceptably light sentences handed out to six individuals who pleaded guilty to involvement in the killing of three UNHCR staff members in Atambua on 6 September 2000 , and the insignificant charges and jail term handed out to a well-known militia leader , have encouraged some hard-line militia elements to plan the resumption of offensive operations designed to destabilize the situation in East Timor in the lead-up to the elections and independence .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
The joint unit established by resolution 1051 ( 1996 ) will continue to review the categorized list in the light of additional information that may become available for the purposes of identifying items that are covered under the relevant provisions of that resolution , because of their possible dual use for civilian and prohibited purposes under resolution 687 ( 1991 ) of 3 April 1991 and other relevant resolutions .  
It was stated that , among the rules for interpretation , one analogous to the basic rule established with regard to treaties by article 31 , paragraph 1 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties , could be drafted to the effect that an act should be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the act in their context and in the light of its object .  
The efforts at the country level by the United Nations system organizations , in particular within the framework of the Resident Coordinator system , to help least developed countries translate goals and targets of major global conferences and summits into concrete actions in the light of national priorities , provide an opportunity for the promotion of an effective follow-up to the commitments of the Programme of Action .  
By the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged States in a position to do so to take appropriate national measures to destroy surplus , confiscated or collected small arms and light weapons , and to provide , on a voluntary basis , information to the Secretary-General on the types and quantities of arms destroyed as well as the methods of their destruction , and requested the Secretary-General to circulate this information annually to all States .  
The Ministers recalled that the illicit trade in small arms in the region is mainly associated with drug trafficking , terrorism , transnational organized crime , mercenary activities and other criminal acts , and held that crime prevention must therefore be an integral part of the approach to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . 
In the light of that request , the Government of Panama wishes to state for the record that it deems the issue under discussion to be an internal matter for the Chinese people , to be resolved through respectful dialogue and mutual understanding , and it considers that supporting this request by a large number of States Members of the United Nations in no way affects the cordial relations of friendship and collaboration that Panama aspires to maintain and strengthen with the Peoples Republic of China .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
We are fully aware of the close and complex link between terrorism , organized crime , drug-trafficking , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the illegal trafficking and easy availability of small arms and light weapons .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
I believe that we should be delighted that the Conference was successful in producing a Programme of Action that provides the best possible effective measures at the national , regional and international levels to prevent and combat illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
What made this achievement so meaningful was the fact that the entire international community came together to recognize the magnitude of these problems and to agree on measures to combat and prevent illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons at the national , regional and global levels .  
The Institute , in partnership with subregional groupings of member States and in close cooperation with certain concerned civil society organizations , has been involved in implementing subregional initiatives and priorities undertaken towards responding to vital national security concerns and finding practical solutions and support with respect to the problem of illicit proliferation , circulation and trafficking in small arms and light weapons . 
In the context of the international efforts being made to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and in light of the fact that countries that function as financial and banking centres have enacted laws on the laundering of the proceeds of illegal activities , the United Arab Emirates , after protracted study , has elaborated a draft law on money laundering that was approved by the Council of Ministers at its meeting held yesterday . 
The illicit trade in small arms and light weapons is directly linked to social , economic and humanitarian problems caused by the domestic civil confrontations and international conflicts , as well as by the ruthless action of organized crime , especially that of terrorism and drug traffickers .  
It is unfortunate that , due to the inflexible position adopted by one delegation , responding to its own narrow national interests , the Programme could not make even a minimal reference to questions of key importance , such as those related to the unrestricted trade in and possession of small arms and light weapons and the need for these arms to be provided only to Governments or entities authorized by them .  
The draft Programme of Action on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons through various measures on the national , regional and international levels , and the follow-up mechanisms has established a solid basis for the international community and is a first step towards fighting the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  
In the light of the follow-up to the Millennium Declaration adopted last year by our leaders , we urge all Member States to undertake continued negotiations within the framework of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies , leading to total nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control .  
In the light of these considerations and the purport of General Assembly resolution 54 / 200 , in particular paragraph 2 thereof , it is incumbent on the members of the international community to abide by the principle that unilateral coercive economic and political measures against States contravene the principles of the multilateral trading system .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
The problem of the illicit traffic in and the circulation of small arms and light weapons within the region of Southeastern Europe is of particular concern for the Republic of Macedonia , especially after the 1997 civilian unrest in Albania and the conflict in Kosovo ; it poses a serious threat not only to the security and stability of my country but to the broader region as well , particularly through its severe , adverse impact on economic , social and human development .  
Mindful of the serious threat posed to international peace and security by the illicit small arms trade and of the destabilizing impact of the illegal transfer of such weapons at the regional level , we attach importance to and participate actively in efforts to control small arms and light weapons , which are not yet covered by multilateral disarmament arrangements .  
Lastly , it was important to note that the impunity of perpetrators was a primary obstacle to ensuring universal respect for the blue flag ; the light sentences handed down in the trial of those responsible for the savage killings of United Nations staff members in West Timor clearly sent the wrong message . 
In addition , pursuant to Security Council resolution 1308 ( 2000 ) of 17 July 2000 , and in the light of the potential spread of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection among the population of Sierra Leone as well as among the Missions military and civilian personnel , it is proposed that a post for an HIV / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) policy officer be established at the P-4 level .  
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
Towards this objective and in the light of the gradual forward deployment of the Mission and progressive control of areas held by RUF , the critical aspects that these efforts specifically necessitate are the promotion of the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , the truth and reconciliation process , the peace-building activities of UNAMSIL and preparations for national elections . 
From this perspective and in the light of the international momentum towards achieving universal accession to the Agencys safeguards regime , we are amazed at the position of certain countries that are active and influential in the field of non-proliferation , which occasionally adopt a negative attitude towards the need to attain universal accession to the safeguards system .  This clear contradiction demonstrates the lack of credibility of certain influential countries in dealing seriously with the countries that fail to comply with the principles now enshrined at the international level .  
The functions of the Section are : ( i ) to receive evidence in a manner that can be sustained and proven in court ; ( ii ) to analyse the evidence in the light of the latest forensic developments ; and ( iii ) the expert preparation of evidence in a form that is provable in court .  
Such measures are , inter alia , collection and responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements , particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered ; confidence-building measures ; disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants ; demining ; and conversion ,  
Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures , especially with regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons , which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic development in many regions , particularly in post-conflict situations ,  
As a primary sponsor of that draft resolution , South Africa is particularly pleased that the Secretariat managed to source from existing budgetary provisions adequate funding for the conference servicing required for the first biennial meeting of States contemplated in paragraph 2 of the draft resolution , as well as for the meetings of a group of experts to examine the feasibility of developing an international instrument for tracing illicit small arms and light weapons , referred to in paragraph 10 .  
The Government also reported that a supreme decree of June 2001 established the Truth Commission , whose mandate is to help shed light on the crimes and human rights violations committed by terrorist organizations and State agents , to prepare proposals on moral and material reparations for victims and their families and to recommend legal and institutional reforms as preventive guarantees .  
Recognizes that the White Helmets , in close cooperation with the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and as an operational partner of the United Nations system , are an efficient and viable mechanism for making pre-identified and trained homogeneous teams available to the United Nations , in support of immediate relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development activities , in the light of the increasing number , growing magnitude and complexity of natural disasters and other emergencies ;  
Believe that extreme poverty , environmental degradation , underdevelopment , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , and the lack of equity in income distribution impact all the countries in the international community , particularly developing countries , and that it is in this light that international cooperation should be regarded as a unifying element for the efforts of the peoples and Governments of the entire world to build a common objective : to improve the living conditions of present and future generations . 
The Advisory Committee recommends that the Fifth Committee inform the General Assembly that , should it adopt draft resolution A / C . 2 / 56 / L . 78 , net additional appropriations up to $ 1,220,700 , as specified in paragraph 27 of the statement submitted by the Secretary-General , would be required at this stage , subject to the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency fund , it being understood that this amount would be adjusted in the light of the report requested above .  
Fourth , because the Commission can not possibly , for political and / or practical reasons , shed light on all countries in which there are severe and consistent patterns of human rights abuse , the Sub-Commission has used country-specific resolutions and statements by the Chairperson to help identify and put pressure on those countries which may not have received adequate attention in other human rights bodies .  
In the light of the evolving nature of the institutional support provided for the regional action programme in Asia , the Asian national focal points may agree on the modalities of reporting at the regional level , on the understanding that the task managers and hosts of the thematic programme networks of the RAP would draft the chapters of the regional report corresponding to their respective fields of activites .  
Recalling also article 22 , paragraph 2 ( a ) of the Convention , which provides that the Conference of the Parties shall regularly review the implementation of the Convention and the functioning of its institutional arrangements in the light of the experience gained at the national , subregional , regional and international levels and on the basis of the evolution of scientific and technological knowledge ,  
In the light of the foregoing , we call upon you to intervene on the basis of the facts set forth above and to urge Kuwait to halt its unilateral exploitation of the shared transboundary oilfields , which causes the constant migration of our oil resources , and to reach agreement with Iraq on the manner in which these fields can be exploited so as to safeguard the rights of both parties .  
In light of the circumstances prevailing in Kuwait , the E2A Panel concluded that , in the absence of evidence to the contrary , where [ non-perishable ] goods arrived at a Kuwaiti seaport on or after 2 July 1990 or at a Kuwaiti airport on or after 17 July 1990 and could not thereafter be located by the claimant , an inference can be made that the goods were lost or destroyed as a direct result of Iraqs invasion and occupation of Kuwait .  
In its E2 ( 1 ) report , this Panel considered the meaning of a threat of military action and at paragraphs 158163 , concluded that a threat of military action outside of Kuwait must be a credible and serious threat that was intimately connected to Iraqs invasion and occupation and within the actual military capability of the entity issuing the threat , as judged in light of the actual theatre of military operations during the relevant period .  
In contrast , the visible light from obtrusive advertising , defined as advertising in outer space that is capable of being recognised by a human being on the surface of the Earth without the aid of a telescope or other technological device , [ 2 ] is inescapable .  
Strengthening or developing agreed norms and measures at the global , regional and national levels that would reinforce and further coordinate efforts to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ;  
Urges Member States , in the light of the extensive needs to be addressed by the Office of the High Commissioner , to respond generously , promptly , predictably and adequately to his appeal for resources to meet in full the approved 2002 Annual Programme Budget , and explore future ways to ensure a coherent and broader financing base , founded on the principle of solidarity and burden-sharing . 
To establish , at its fifty-eighth session , an inter-sessional open-ended working group of the Commission , with the mandate to elaborate , in the light of the findings of the independent expert , a draft legally binding normative instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance , taking into account , inter alia , the draft international convention on the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance transmitted by the Sub-Commission , for consideration and adoption by the General Assembly .
