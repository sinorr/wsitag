Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
Over the past years , our military junior colleges have provided different training programs for commanding skill and technical skill .  Military academies at the intermediate level have offered different programs for their students in accordance with their professional specialties , for example , military affairs , political affairs , logical affairs , and general staff .  Officers from artillery , armament , engineering , and communications branches have had to learn at different schools to acquire the skill for commanding a particular military branch and the skill for commanding joint operations .  
In order to deepen the teaching reform , we should strive to achieve this goal : We should cultivate personnel who are qualified politically and ideologically , who have a top-notch military quality , who have a solid foundation in science and culture , who have a profound understanding of professional skill , who have a rather strong innovative ability , and who have a fine physical and mental quality .

It is beyond any doubt that we need to study and master professional knowledge and the knowledge of science and technology ; however , we should also see clearly that along with the deepening of modern scientific research and as a result of the increasingly detailed division of labor , we have a greater need for the guidance of advanced ideological theories and a correct world outlook .  
For instance , there are many outstanding or top-notch people of great academic attainments in society who have attained a high level in scientific research and professional skills , but military units can not enlist them because of their age and physical conditions ; in such a case , we can adopt a measure for employment under contract so that we can use their knowledge , technology , and other intellectual resources and that they can provide services for us in a certain way and at a definite time .  2 .

This remains a major factor that constrains the development of the procuratorial work .  We must make persistent and unremitting efforts to further improve the work of the procuratorates at the grass-roots level .  
The current national work conference of procuratorial organs on promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorates will play an effective role in further deepening reforms in the procuratorial work , intensifying judicial supervision , guaranteeing fairness in law enforcement , promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorial organs , and bringing into the new century a contingent of high-quality procurators who will live up to the hopes of the party and the people and have a high degree of professional proficiency .

YMTDIV Commander Acting Superintendent Mr Mark Foster commented : " Both officers acted in a thoroughly professional manner and quickly selected the most appropriate level of force to use in the situation prevailing .

" According to one high level manager at Nan Ya Plastics , the professional knowledge and ability the returned students possessed were very good , but " studying is one thing and actual work is another . " The failure to perform well hurt their prospects for promotion and the returning students themselves lost interest and were not willing to stay on .  
But in fact the supposed tradition stretched back no further : my teachers ' teachers , many of them scholars of foreign origin , were the generation that had established Chinese studies in Britain on a professional footing . They had to learn a lot more by themselves and it was hard to find a good teacher , J . K . Fairbank reveals that when he arrived at Oxford in the 1930s , eager to learn Chinese , Soothill left him to fend for himself .  
In a commercialized society , with temple meetings in south Taiwan increasingly large , yi-chen are still not without a way out to survive . But with the gradual outmigration of the rural population , the trend of waxing and waning among community and professional chen can not , it seems , be altered .  
The stiff , simple and vigorous dance steps of male troupes are the giveaway for the " village " amateurs ; all-female dancers who punctuate their graceful feminine motions with daring stunts belong , more likely than not , to professional troupes .

"  
Ilan author Li Tung writes feelingly : " Their acting may still be a bit raw and unpolished , and there are flaws in the continuity , but compared with the lackadaisical performance of some professional troupes that are stuck in a rut and never try anything new , their sincerity and concentration are all the more fresh and moving . "  
" Star " level personalities with attractive faces and sleek bodies would cooperate with a professional photographer to produce a series of carefully calculated shots .

Never mind the boss wife 's beautiful , fresh outward appearance that makes her seem so intelligent and capable . Actually , her self image and sense of personal worth may very well be stunted by the view she has long fostered that she must always look after others and not care for herself , " Wu Cheng-tien explains . When it comes to having the boss wife give over all her professional obligations to someone else , there usually is an ineffable feeling of loss .  
But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude .

But this is no reason , as pro ball enters its fifth year , not to invite readers to a spectator 's -eye view of the action down at the ballpark .

Yang Wei-min , a senior science and technology reporter for the China Times , came to the conclusion that rivalry among executives regarding level of professional expertise was the major reason for bad personnel relations at the NSPO .

The project would also include other events such as talks by famous actors like Hugh Lee and Liang Tzu-yun , and camps designed to help teachers practice writing and directing .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Now that athletic sports have developed to the point of maturity and beyond , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) is very interested in promoting " mental sports .

Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry .

"  
Back when golf was the exclusive domain of the " lofty and rich , " many children from poor families headed to the golf courses to serve as caddies for the wealthy , eventually making reputations themselves among Asia 's few elite professional golfers . Such players as Lu Liang-huan , Hsieh Min-nan , and Chen Chih-chung share similar stories of struggle , from poverty to caddy , and finally to professional golfer .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
Looking at this list , commentators have identified a number of characteristics : a broad , cross-party base ; attention to economic and financial issues ; emphasis on professional ability ; and stress on the appointment of women and of outstanding people from outside central government .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good .

The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes .

Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
" The approach adopted now at chinatimes.com is to integrate a number of e-papers and mail these out to members . Although no fees are collected from members , the profit lies in the hidden vertical-depth e-commerce represented by each member , " says Michael Chang , chief operations officer . By working with businesses , treating the e-paper platform as a giant shopping center , and using integrated operations , not only can a news-oriented e-paper survive , its professional reputation can be a guarantee of reliability to consumers .

When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life .

That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .

The paper says that the unemployment problem results from the industrial transformation process and reform needs time .

Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
" A truly professional art therapist will not show off her ability to interpret paintings . On the contrary , she 'll keep this coolly to herself until the individual has acquired the needed courage , until the patient 's timid spirit has grown strong enough , " Lu Su-chen , art therapy consultant for the Student Counseling Center of National Tsing Hua University , has written .  
In this increasingly competitive era , instrumental values like drive , ability to work independently , and professional knowledge are given the greatest weight by society . The media and publishing industry have been warning young people to get themselves geared up for the economic struggles ahead .

Really only modernized countries have the conditions for pro sports , " says Hsu Sheng-ming , head coach of both the Chinatrust Whales and the Chinese Taipei Olympic baseball squad , sharing his profound understanding of the game today . And he should know-he got involved in professional baseball as a coach in 1990 at the age of 32 and has been with professional baseball all along the way ever since .  
When the company took control of the Bears this year , it immediately adopted Kaohsiung 's Cheng-Ching Lake Baseball Stadium and took a more professional tack in managing the team , improving the diet , clothing , living arrangements and transportation it provided to the players .

" They received free promotion of their corporate image , " observes Central Broadcasting System 's Fan Chung-kuang , who has covered professional baseball for eight years .  
Before climbing Yushan I had been told there were several professional photographers staying at the weather station . One of them , Li Tai-chun , discussed his photographic experience with me . In 1990 CWB chief Tsai Ching-yen visited Yushan , where he saw a particularly stunning sunset over a sea of clouds . This made him consider the possibility of producing an Yushan calendar filled with such breathtaking vistas , and Yushan Weather Station was put in charge of the project .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide .

It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
Conservative estimates indicate that in urban schools , each classroom sees on average two or three emotionally disturbed students or students coming from problem families . " I 've even seen students who have sold sex on the Internet , and others who have been sexually abused in their own homes ! " says teacher Li Man-yun of Taipei 's Peicheng Junior High School . Indeed , such issues are beyond the professional capacities of teachers , and call for the assistance of social service agencies .  
Before that time , all primary and junior high school teachers were trained in specialist teacher training institutions or in the education departments of a small number of regular universities . These students were all government funded , and the government was responsible for their professional placement after graduation . The students were guaranteed lifetime employment , and aside from their professional training , their education emphasized a sense of national spirit .

Unless management is given the ability and freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest calibre , from anywhere in the world and this can be done only if remuneration is internationally competitive and if Governments refrain from interfering in a fair selection process it will be hard , if not impossible , to achieve the continuous improvement in quality and efficiency that is rightly called for in the secretariats of United Nations organizations .

Such regional cooperative mechanisms could be facilitated through public / private partnerships and provide support to Governments , industry , non-governmental educational institutions and other domestic and international organizations , and by strengthening global professional networks ;  
Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .

The most serious problems identified at that time were the lack of independence and autonomy of judicial action , the existence of obvious signs of corruption , the inefficiency of constitutional justice , the absence of proper professional training for the judiciary , the existence of obsolete laws , the lack of guarantees and recurrent violations of the rules of due process .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
As already discussed , the quality of staff at the higher level is often impressive , but at other levels we are of the belief that quality could be improved through increased training and greater horizontal communication ( including perhaps the publication of an in-house professional periodical ) .

The main task of high-quality policy development is to provide professional help in terms of statecraft 's attempt to influence collective trajectories into the future , so as to decrease the probability of bad futures and increase the probability of good ones , taking into account that these concepts may change in time .

Everyone makes their own special contributions . By combining our resources , our lives and activities have become much more varied , " Wang says . To publish the newsletter , professional botanists living in the community provide information about plants , those who studied art provide the graphics , and those who work for magazines write and edit the copy . The result is an impressive newsletter that is a major resource for keeping people informed and for building a sense of cohesion within the community .  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
Three years ago , Luotung High School principal Hsu Wen-shong received a letter from the Paper Windmill Theater Troupe , saying that the Council for Cultural Affairs had commissioned them to implement a " Youth Theatre Project .

The project would also include other events such as talks by famous actors like Hugh Lee and Liang Tzu-yun , and camps designed to help teachers practice writing and directing .  
We have all undergone rigorous professional training , and of course we know that buildings need to fit in with the urban landscape . In addition to being accepted by the owners , the designs for our super-skyscrapers were all approved by the relevant urban authorities , with very close attention given to questions about their height , and whether or not they would fit in with the surrounding environment . In New York for example , whatever you build is going to be tall , and no-one thinks there 's anything strange about that .  
Modern doctors have to pass exams to get into medical school , and study hard for many years before they can begin their professional lives . It is not easy to become an indigenous shaman either . One must be selected by the ancestral souls . Although one may go on her own to become an acolyte to a practicing shaman , there 's no guarantee that she will " graduate " and win " certification . "  
Now that athletic sports have developed to the point of maturity and beyond , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) is very interested in promoting " mental sports .

Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry .

"  
Back when golf was the exclusive domain of the " lofty and rich , " many children from poor families headed to the golf courses to serve as caddies for the wealthy , eventually making reputations themselves among Asia 's few elite professional golfers . Such players as Lu Liang-huan , Hsieh Min-nan , and Chen Chih-chung share similar stories of struggle , from poverty to caddy , and finally to professional golfer .  
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in Taiwan , including NTU , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat-sen University , Da-Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan-Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel . What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ? Liao Ching-jong , director of the NTUST College of Management , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know-how , while seasoned middle - and top-level executives seek an edge in management .  
There was a time when the gong was shunned by most professional musicians , who did n't want its loud , brash sound in their modern , air-conditioned concert halls . Even when it did make an appearance , the star of the show in boisterous outdoor temple parades was only allowed to make muffled hints at its real capabilities .  
Looking at this list , commentators have identified a number of characteristics : a broad , cross-party base ; attention to economic and financial issues ; emphasis on professional ability ; and stress on the appointment of women and of outstanding people from outside central government .  
But another music industry professional , MTV Taiwan 's programming and creative department supervisor Dennis Yang , has a different point of view . " It 's impossible to change the commercialization and unsophisticated taste of pop music , " he says . As for awards being given to Pur-dur and other similar artists , he feels it is good to encourage the creation of works with different creative perspectives . " But it 's still impossible to create a popular demand in the market for works that have lost contact with commercial taste . "  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good .

The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes .

Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
" The approach adopted now at chinatimes.com is to integrate a number of e-papers and mail these out to members . Although no fees are collected from members , the profit lies in the hidden vertical-depth e-commerce represented by each member , " says Michael Chang , chief operations officer . By working with businesses , treating the e-paper platform as a giant shopping center , and using integrated operations , not only can a news-oriented e-paper survive , its professional reputation can be a guarantee of reliability to consumers .

When Yang made his first trip to mainland China in 1989 , he never expected that CHM would become the professional preoccupation of the rest of his life .

That 's when he decided to go into the business of gathering , inspecting , and trading raw materials for CHM , and even cultivating basic sources of botanical pharmaceuticals .  
Fang notes that the firm 's target market remains professional women . Modern women require clothes that are highly functional and presentable , but also comfortable , practical and easy to clean . For example , knitwear that can be machine-washed is a product that is both popular and practical .  
The paper says that the unemployment problem results from the industrial transformation process and reform needs time .

Chen Chung-en , president of Yu-Da Institute of Business Technology , points out that in Germany , where technical and vocational education is particularly successful , a professional license is worth even more than a university degree . And though Taiwan 's licensing system is not yet fully developed , Yu-Da Institute still requires that students get at least two licenses in order to graduate . People studying data processing , for example , have to get a Class C computer technician license and pass the General English Proficiency Test .  
Logically , after students are streamed into the vocational educational system , the future path to higher education should not be determined on the basis of general subjects . " But whether they want to become nurses or civil engineering technicians , and whether they are applying to a technical college or a technical university , in the exams they are tested in Chinese , English and math , " says Tien . " There is no emphasis on professional abilities at all . "  
" A truly professional art therapist will not show off her ability to interpret paintings . On the contrary , she 'll keep this coolly to herself until the individual has acquired the needed courage , until the patient 's timid spirit has grown strong enough , " Lu Su-chen , art therapy consultant for the Student Counseling Center of National Tsing Hua University , has written .  
In this increasingly competitive era , instrumental values like drive , ability to work independently , and professional knowledge are given the greatest weight by society .

When the company took control of the Bears this year , it immediately adopted Kaohsiung 's Cheng-Ching Lake Baseball Stadium and took a more professional tack in managing the team , improving the diet , clothing , living arrangements and transportation it provided to the players .

" They received free promotion of their corporate image , " observes Central Broadcasting System 's Fan Chung-kuang , who has covered professional baseball for eight years .  
Before climbing Yushan I had been told there were several professional photographers staying at the weather station . One of them , Li Tai-chun , discussed his photographic experience with me .

This made him consider the possibility of producing an Yushan calendar filled with such breathtaking vistas , and Yushan Weather Station was put in charge of the project .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide .

Indeed , such issues are beyond the professional capacities of teachers , and call for the assistance of social service agencies .  
Before that time , all primary and junior high school teachers were trained in specialist teacher training institutions or in the education departments of a small number of regular universities . These students were all government funded , and the government was responsible for their professional placement after graduation . The students were guaranteed lifetime employment , and aside from their professional training , their education emphasized a sense of national spirit .

Unless management is given the ability and freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest calibre , from anywhere in the world and this can be done only if remuneration is internationally competitive and if Governments refrain from interfering in a fair selection process it will be hard , if not impossible , to achieve the continuous improvement in quality and efficiency that is rightly called for in the secretariats of United Nations organizations .

The most serious problems identified at that time were the lack of independence and autonomy of judicial action , the existence of obvious signs of corruption , the inefficiency of constitutional justice , the absence of proper professional training for the judiciary , the existence of obsolete laws , the lack of guarantees and recurrent violations of the rules of due process .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched .

The second model , the information initiative approach , requires a series of basic steps that generate high quality of information , which then can be utilized to identify ( a ) shortcomings in the current human resources capacities of the public sector ; ( b ) types of professional development programmes needed in order to upgrade the quality of the staff ; and ( c ) the knowledge and skills needed for those who will be recruited into the public sector .  
The real challenge in the area of reforming the social sector is to transcend the current limitations of its organizations , which are isolated , inflexible , overly centralized , hostile to genuine participation , unwilling to address the problems created by power struggles , reluctant to cooperate , of insufficient importance in the State apparatus and lacking in professional career paths for managers and in managers with specialized training in the social sphere .
