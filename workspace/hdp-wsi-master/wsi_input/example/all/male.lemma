As part of this way of thinking , Chinese people strive to maintain a balance within the individual between the forces of yin and yang ( the dual principles of male and female , or positive and negative ) , which have influenced the concepts of hot and cold in Chinese food and medicine .  
The prime meaning of the word kan or " stem " is a strong and powerful tree trunk , representing the Yang or male principle ; the word chih or " branch " originally meant a weak and tender twig , thus representing the Yin or female principle .  
Firstly , the Yin &amp; Yang principles described in the I-ching ( Classic of Changes ) can indicate many polarities such as the sun &amp; moon , day &amp; night , light &amp; dark , motion &amp; rest , internal &amp; external , cold &amp; heat , hard &amp; soft , and male &amp; female .  
In traditional Chinese ghost stories the principal character is often a fetchingly lovely female ghost . This no doubt heightens the tension of the story , but there is also a good reason behind it - - unmarried women who die young have no male progeny to carry out ancestral worship within their spouse 's family , neither can they be accommodated in their own family 's ancestral spirit tablet , which means their fate is more liable than most to be that of a wandering ghost .  
" One male patient received a heart from a female donor , and was worried he would turn into a woman , " recalls Dr . Chu with a smile . In fact the patient 's weak heart had arrested his physical development , and after receiving the strong and healthy transplant heart he grew bigger and his whiskers sprouted with new vigor . " The transplant actually made him more masculine ! "  
As long as 120 years ago , just after it was founded , it treated applicants of all backgrounds just the same - - whether black or white , rich or poor , male or female . It is a citadel of academia that lives up to the ideal of " education without discrimination , " in the words of Confucius .  
In the late 19th century , when colleges on the East Coast were still debating whether to open their doors to the general public , Cornell already accepted students of all backgrounds - - no matter whether they were black or white , rich or poor , male or female , all were treated the same .  
The stiff , simple and vigorous dance steps of male troupes are the giveaway for the " village " amateurs ; all-female dancers who punctuate their graceful feminine motions with daring stunts belong , more likely than not , to professional troupes .  
" Absorbing foreign myths is one of the special features of Chinese culture , " says Cheng Chih - ming , an associate professor in the Graduate School of Theology at Fu Jen University , who studies popular religion in Taiwan . For example there is the male deity Kuan Yin , who transformed into Princess Miaoshan , the beloved daughter of King Miaochuang , after coming to China , and from that transformed into Kuan Yin , the Goddess of Mercy .  
A woman 's touch in management : One old and respected photographer , who like Chen Li-hung herself graduated from the Toyo School of Photography in Japan , comments that Chen Li-hung 's secret lay in promoting her business by making skilful use of the prestige of studying in Japan , of media advertising and of special offers ; these were ideas that would not even have occurred to many of the less imaginative male photographers .  
The bloody fighting in Taiwan that broke out between native Taiwanese and newcomers from mainland China on February 28 , 1947 ( known in Taiwan as the 228 Incident ) is seen as the greatest point of friction for provincial sentiments on the island . Yet , in the city of Hualien , the well-known medical family of Chan Chi-lang , after three of its male members were killed following the incident , has still managed to come up with two daughters-in-law and one son-in-law whose origins lie in mainland Chinese provinces .  
He says that in South Africa there is a scientist who has studied black eagles for more than twenty years . The male and female black eagle are completely identical in their external physical features , but through many years of observation , she became able to distinguish the male and female of a pair of black eagles flying together , from their attitude and position .  
This was due to rifts within the community on the Shankuang Estate between people who had supported different candidates in the local elections , and to people from different Ami tribes insisting on their own customs .

The spread of ages included in each age grade varies from three to five years , and there are also differences in traditional dress , and so on .  
The point of a feminist juggling various theories should be to look for the strategy with which to subvert patriarchal culture , but as a product of the capitalist commodity culture , Madonna may be loaded with individualism but yet harbors no intent to oppose male dominance . It is accurate to say that feminist game strategy and Madonna 's performing style can not readily be compared in one breath .  
In the " Conference on Hakka Culture , " part of this year 's arts and cultural festival , a report written by a Hakka man in praise of Hakka women was suddenly criticized by Huang Yu-hsiu , an associate professor of foreign languages at National Taiwan University , as " having a male chauvinist pig viewpoint and objectifying women . " This brought a sudden quiet , but many younger Hakka women silently approved of the professor 's comments .  
Most of English-language radio station ICRT 's listening audience are students . David Wang , host of " The Youth Nightline , " believes that what concerns young people are passing exams , careers , interpersonal communication and male / female relations . But because this material gets mulled over a lot , " we have to interject topics from the news too . " In fact , he believes that such controversial and timely issues as campus violence and sex education are very well-received .  
The institution Mr . Chen worked for was a unit dealing with foreign affairs . During the six years of his employment there , he had many opportunities to be stationed abroad , but not once did he take so much as a single step outside the country . Always remembering that he was the only male in the third generation of his extended family , every week he returned to the family ' s home several times to help his paraplegic grandfather bathe . Such traditional filial responsibilities were his to shoulder .  
Now our ' Little Cutey ' is afraid that the audience seated in the rear wo n't get a clear view , so she is coming down from the stage to meet everybody . Please , everyone , look but do n't touch .

We walked and walked , then the elephant drivers figured out that we were heading in the wrong direction , and refused to go any further . At that time , we had no choice but to pull out our guns and announce our identity . Then the frightened elephant drivers scattered in a big flurry , leaving behind thirteen elephants , big and small , male and female . Linwang was the youngest and strongest of them . "  
Two years ago , the " seven wolves of NTNU " incident shed light on the long running , but heretofore unpublicized , problem of sexual harassment of female students by male professors . The incident has certainly served as a warning to many professors of questionable morals . But there has been some spillover affecting " innocent " instructors .  
An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi . And so whether one suffers from a sore back , nagging sore throat , or weak blood and qi ; whether one is male or female , old or young ; there are appropriate prescriptions containing turtle shell that vary according to age and condition .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
In the Ming dynasty story " The Oil Peddler and the Plum Flower Girl " ( included in the collection Lasting Words to Awaken the World ) , the usually unruffled soul of the leading male character Qin Zhong is as if struck by lightning : " He stood dumbstruck for an age , his whole body limp and numb " - is that not what people today mean when they say someone is " love-struck " ?  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
The millennial tradition of patrilineal filiation is being recognized by women 's groups as the source of two thousand years of Chinese preferential gender treatment , " valuing the male and devaluing the female , " and " ennobling the male and debasing the female . " Dagmar You says , " Patri-lineal filiation makes the male into the orthodox carrier of the lineage bloodline in perpetuity , and the females are removed from the genealogical records . "  
Lee and other economy class travelers heard passengers from other airlines being taken to hotels , and saw arrangements being made for food and accomodations for the first-class passengers on the Malaysian Airlines flight . However , the sky was already lightening in the east when the elderly and infirm passengers from economy class were taken to a hotel , and the young , strong male passengers in the main cabin were left in the airport right up until the plane returned to Taipei .  
With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .  
On October 13 , police in Hsinchu County 's Chutung Precinct broke a shocking criminal case involving youths-thirteen teenagers , both male and female , had confined a 14-year old girl to a room , beaten her to death , and then buried her body .  
Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
On items such as burial articles , painted bricks and " money trees , " there are numerous images of Xi Wang Mu , the Queen Mother of the West , accompanied by such motifs as immortal cranes , peaches of immortality and orioles . Today the Queen Mother-still greatly revered , and by now " betrothed " to the Royal Lord of the East-is in charge of all mortals , male or female , who enter heaven after death .  
At the same time that the anti-impo-tency drug Viagra has been making its global splash in the world of medicine , here in the ROC both Taiwan Sugar Corp . and Union Chemical Laboratories at the Industrial Technology Research Institute have been working to mass-produce the treasured Cordyceps sinensis , a fungus used in Chinese herbal medicine to fortify the kidneys and revive flagging male libidos . Meanwhile , the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine has been analyzing the pharmaceutical properties of herbal remedies claimed by ancient Chinese medical books to bolster virility .  
Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .  
A few years ago , male writer Ku Ling , speaking at a public forum , advised married Taiwanese men to beware of " public menaces . " He was referring to well-educated , independent , and ambitious women who were unwilling to settle down .  
Chen Yi-ming points out that male genitalia are less likely to develop sores , and the mucus membranes in female sexual organs have a larger number of monocytes that are receptive to viruses . In addition , seminal fluid contains more viruses than vaginal fluid . For these reasons , women are more easily infected by men than vice versa .  
Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
As women have rewritten their gender characteristics , some reassessment has been made of the male box . It has been discovered that this rigid box has not only crushed women and children under it , it has also deformed men-those allegedly advantaged by it . It has stifled their emotions , destroyed their health , reduced the happiness they get out of daily life , and made them lonely and violent .  
Besides showing earning potential , responsibility , and trust , they say , the ideal male would also be emotionally honest , interested in life , understanding of others , open to continued personal growth , and always considerate of the woman 's feelings .  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
Socket joints were used to join the pieces together , with the male element on one piece fitting into the female element of the next piece . When molten bronze was then poured into the joint , it would harden and join the pieces together while preserving the smooth outer surface .  
Not knowing this story , the Japanese naturally do n't carry out dragon boat races , as we Chinese do . It was at some point during the Edo period ( 1607-1867 ) that tango no sekku came to be seen as a festival for boys . Families with male children began to use the festival as a chance to pray that their sons would grow up strong and brave . As an expression of their wishes , they took to displaying statues dressed in the armor worn by medieval Japanese warriors .  
Each week , the segment features three well-developed hunks dressed in swim suits . Following a short conversation between each contestant and the hosts , female audience members approach the stage to place stickers on their favorite choice , and the contestant with the most stickers is declared the winner . The young women are hardly ever shy about flirting with the contestants , seizing the chance to cop a feel of their bare bodies or placing stickers on the more sensitive areas of the male anatomy .  
There are many other ancient Chinese paintings similar to this one of Xuanzong playing chuiwan . The players in them range from children to fine ladies-evidently in old China chuiwan was a game enjoyed by male and female , rich and poor alike .  
Changes that saw the feminine ideal turn toward exalting the sickly and the sentimental , toward women who were fragile and refined , were also reflected in ideas about manly beauty . In Dream of the Red Chamber , the male characters Jia Baoyu and Qin Zhong both possess a gentle , delicate beauty to outdo young women .  
Chinese society is male dominated , and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role . In this kind of unfair situation , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more . A considerate attitude can be expressed in little things . For instance , when you see that a hair has fallen onto a female friend 's shoulder , you should lightly pick it off for her , and throw it away or put it in your pocket .  
I do n't have any plans to pose for a racy photo album . If I were in a movie and they wanted me to do a scene in the nude , it would n't be a problem . But I do n't think that a photo album would a way to express the ideal of male beauty . Maybe the Japanese pop idol Miyazawa Rie can express her own pure esthetic appeal through a photo album , but for a man to convey that kind of natural feeling through still photos is not an easy thing .  
The performance starts off with a thunderous stampede of bass drums symbolizing the creation of the earth , followed by the pitty-pat of small drums that re-create the very first rain drops . The rainfall starts with a desultory plop-plop , then gradually grows into a deluge that creates the vast and boundless seas . The forceful drumming of the male drummers calls to mind ocean waves crashing into a rocky seacoast .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
In contrast to the male way of thinking , in which priority has always been given to considerations of political and economic power , Annette Lu has emphasized " soft national power . " Before her departure she stated that Taiwan advocates human rights , democracy , high-technology , compassion , and peace . If Taiwan can further develop foreign relations using such " soft power , " one day the United Nations will turn around and want Taiwan to join .  
After analyzing large quantities of recorded maroon oriole song , Chang divided the calls of the male bird during the mating season into five categories , according to their sound spectrum . They include a rough and rasping " a - , " a graceful whistle , a rapidly repeated " ga-ga-ga . . . " and so on .  
The collared bush robin is a pretty little bird . The male has a coat of black feathers , a white line across each brow , and a bright band of orange around its neck that makes it look like a dandy wearing a flashy cravat .  
Ho Chun-jui , head of the Center for the Study of Sexualities at National Central University , analyzes the movie in terms of time , place and people thus : The gradual legitimization of homosexuality in Taiwanese culture has lessened the taboo against Lan Yu ; the two cool male protaganists not only show passion and warmth , but also pointedly express intimate tenderness , a breakthrough in the portrayal of the traditional male lead ; and the contradiction between love vs class background and tradition-told without leaving the parameters of a love story-all naturally please the audience .  
The male and female leads were perfectly suited for their roles : male lead Lu Yukun was both handsome and debonair , and female lead Li Lihua , in addition to displaying her youthful beauty , was extremely charming , playing the parts of both mother and daughter in a truly seamless performance .  
Wing quivers , sideways rolls , 360-degree forward and backward flips , and rapid hunting dives with wings pulled in , are all regular elements of the male birds ' body language in the mating season . The variety of their antics causes birdwatchers to cry out in delight , and the female birds watching from the sidelines do not act coy either . They keep their eyes firmly fixed on the males , watching their every move , ready to reward them for their efforts by choosing the partner that pleases them best .  
Bringing together rich and poor , male and female , young and old , it forms a many-sided portrait of life in Taipei , divided into four sections : " Car , " " Home , " " Body " and " Feeling . " From the lives of people who consider themselves normal , she uncovers so much that is humorous and twisted .  
At a symposium on the control of environmental hormones held in April , Professor Liu Li-lian , director of the Institute of Marine Biology at National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung , described the results of a coastal survey in southern Taiwan . The natural ratio of males to females in oyster drills is about one to one , " so when I noticed that the Thais clavigera we were catching had all turned male , I knew something was wrong , " said Liu with alarm .  
The male 's dorsal and pelvic fins have long threadlike rays , and the tips of its red tail fins are extended in a swallowtail shape . The varied effects of their fins rippling in the water are very pleasing to the eye .  
In the sexual spectrum , there is a wide range of colors . To divide male and female into two extreme categories of masculine and feminine would make us unable to understand and appreciate disadvantaged groups . "  
With production costs reaching NT $ 1 billion and intensive promotional efforts that included inviting director Zhang , male lead Tony Leung , and female lead Maggie Cheung to Taiwan , Hero naturally delivered a dazzling box office performance .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
Starting out as two-dimensional lines and colors , Huang 's complex totem-pole-like models undergo a process of simplification and purification as they are transformed into three-dimensional stainless steel objects . Lines formed in the mind and on a drawing board give way to succinct , elegant metallic curves . Rough sketches of the male and female forms become bodies with delicately wrought curves . Heads are almost done away with or only suggested at by welded eyes and eye sockets .  
According to the organizers , the number of people sleeping rough in Taipei City alone is increasing by some 200 every year . The charities currently serve over 2000 homeless people in the city , of whom 90% are male and more than half are aged between 40 and 60 . The majority of them could not face their families after losing their jobs , and finally ended up on the street , as " economic " homeless .

Priorities have to be assigned , using the Programme of Action as a guide , among potential topics - for example , certain aspects of human sexuality , sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS , preparation for family life , promoting the status of women , developing among girls a positive and future-oriented self-image , the dynamics and implications of rapid urbanization , male responsibility and so forth .  
Efforts to involve men as responsible partners in helping to satisfy such needs take on a special urgency given the rapid spread of HIV / AIDS and the potential improvement in reproductive health that would follow if programmes promoted male participation as well as male methods as part of the contraceptive choices available to couples .  
Members requested detailed statistical data in the subsequent report and asked whether the current legislation was not discriminatory in that it made a distinction between female prostitutes and their male clients .  
The list of issues it prepared in considering States parties ' reports always included questions concerning the participation of women in political , economic , social and cultural life and male and female enrolment in schools and universities .  
Furthermore , some of the ILO programmes , such as Occupational Safety and Health and certain of the industry committees , have observed that , since they cover technical fields which continue to have limited numbers of women professionals , especially in the developing world , the participants selected at the national level for their meetings often continue to be male , despite requests made to the national authorities to include women .

The prime meaning of the word kan or " stem " is a strong and powerful tree trunk , representing the Yang or male principle ; the word chih or " branch " originally meant a weak and tender twig , thus representing the Yin or female principle .

In traditional Chinese ghost stories the principal character is often a fetchingly lovely female ghost .

An abnormal excess of male over female births in recent demographic statistics is causing many people to be concerned that in future , men will be hard put to find a mate . Others joke that families with daughters will be in great demand .  
It stated that in many Asian countries , including Taiwan , attitudes of male superiority are deeply rooted , particularly in regions socially influenced by Confucianism and by the traditional notion that " there are three ways to be unfilial , and the worst is to be without issue . " In these societies , the report said , there are frequent cases of female infanticide , and of female fetuses being aborted after their sex is determined by medical tests .  
Western society is also male dominated and male oriented , but it has no tradition of ancestor worship . In the West responsibility for raising children is usually seen as ending at age 18 , when they are expected to become independent , and the notion of inheriting family property is less pronounced . Furthermore , with such factors as a longer period of industrialization and the impact throughout society of the women 's movement since the 1960s , the degree of sexual bias in the West is naturally much less .  
Professor Yang Kuo-chu of NTU 's psychology department sums up the situation by saying that in the West , demographic change and equal rights for women have developed over a relatively long period , whereas in Taiwan demographic change has been compressed into a short timeframe , and it is difficult for traditions of male preeminence and of continuation of the male family line to disappear so quickly . These factors , combined with the timely appearance of techniques for determining fetal gender , probably provide the best explanation for the imbalance between male and female births .  
In fact the exact ratio of male to female births is not what is important . Scholars believe that a question even more worth discussing ought to be why , in a society which calls itself modern and prides itself on having created an economic miracle , the phenomenon of using prenatal diagnostic testing to determine fetal gender and then aborting female fetuses should exist at all . For if we attack mainland China 's one-child policy for producing infanticide , how is this practice different from what happens on the mainland ?  
Huang explains that turtle shell 's effects should n't be so narrowly defined . Rather it should be regarded as increasing general vitality , just as developing skills in waidan kung fu can develop one 's qi .

Look back at all the various ghosts-the male ghost who fears that no one will look after him , the female phantom trapped in the pain of emotional hurt and revenge , the old man unable to rest in peace in a tomb full of water , and the aggrieved " substitute seeking " ghost looking everywhere for someone to stand in for it-and you will notice something interesting : The appearance of ghosts reflects the fact that life is too short ; the tragedies of ghosts represent the persistent attachment to the mundane world .  
In the Ming dynasty story " The Oil Peddler and the Plum Flower Girl " ( included in the collection Lasting Words to Awaken the World ) , the usually unruffled soul of the leading male character Qin Zhong is as if struck by lightning : " He stood dumbstruck for an age , his whole body limp and numb " - is that not what people today mean when they say someone is " love-struck " ?  
Of course , men and women are different . Just as cases involving guns or narcotics are commonly assigned to male prosecutors , currently many cases of " undermining public morality , " such as adultery , rape , prostitution , and violent sexual offenses , have been assigned to women . In this way , female victims are n't intimidated by a male prosecutor , or embarrassed to describe what happened in detail . It also prevents female victims from unintentionally being hurt more .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down . The main reason was the powerful obstruction of the " male outlook . "  
The millennial tradition of patrilineal filiation is being recognized by women 's groups as the source of two thousand years of Chinese preferential gender treatment , " valuing the male and devaluing the female , " and " ennobling the male and debasing the female . " Dagmar You says , " Patri-lineal filiation makes the male into the orthodox carrier of the lineage bloodline in perpetuity , and the females are removed from the genealogical records . "

With transportation in and out of Pet �n being so difficult , the standard of living is poor . The Mission 's members laughingly call themselves modern day Su Wus ( after an official posted at the edge of the empire to watch sheep until his all male flock should happen to give birth to a lamb ) .

Chinese have always encouraged those whose marriages are in trouble to stay together . Nevertheless , while divorce is certainly not desirable , it is the main way to bring unfortunate marriages to an end . It is an essential form of protection for both sexes . The problem is , when a marriage hits the rocks , can the male and female players agree to cut the knot as smoothly as they tied it ?  
On items such as burial articles , painted bricks and " money trees , " there are numerous images of Xi Wang Mu , the Queen Mother of the West , accompanied by such motifs as immortal cranes , peaches of immortality and orioles . Today the Queen Mother-still greatly revered , and by now " betrothed " to the Royal Lord of the East-is in charge of all mortals , male or female , who enter heaven after death .

Looking at the lions in detail , we find that some have been given only vampire-like canine teeth , while others have neatly chiseled rows of incisors as regular as the kernels on a corn cob ; the ball played with by the male lion may be held in its mouth , trapped under its feet or balanced on its belly , as the fancy takes the artist .

Paiwan pottery can be divided into male and female . Male pots have designs of the hundred-pace snake while female pots are decorated with nipples . Because the Paiwan tribe long ago lost techniques for making pots , contemporary artists such as Pavavalung must attempt to imitate ancient pots .  
As women have rewritten their gender characteristics , some reassessment has been made of the male box . It has been discovered that this rigid box has not only crushed women and children under it , it has also deformed men-those allegedly advantaged by it .

Chinese society is male dominated , and women are mostly regarded as having a subsidiary role . In this kind of unfair situation , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more .
