Song outside Qiantang Gate , which comprised a thick wild rice stem soup and sliced raw common carp and crucian carp .  
Over 50 bronze heads were discovered at Sanxingdui , and they feature a wide variety of headgear , including gold masks , fancy hairstyles , braided head bands , and curly hair that seems to surge forward like breakers at the beach .  
" Elections in Taiwan are everywhere marred by black gold politics . I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
As for the imperial clubs , according to The Book of Chuiwan they were edged with pure gold , inlaid with jade , and their shafts sumptuously decorated . When their majesties had finished playing , their equipment was not put away in bags , but placed in brocaded cases . Even today 's top-flight golf clubs , which sell for NT $ 800-900,000 a set , would look pretty shabby next to kit like this .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .  
The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " ( the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , and raising economic competitiveness .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
When one talks of Chinese architecture , what people are probably most familiar with is multi-layered dougong block-and-bracket structures under flying eaves , and vermilion pillars supporting square-paneled " caisson " ceilings painted with dragon-and-phoenix designs in gold , green and a rainbow of other colors-the " palatial " style .  
When news of the gold rush in Australia reached China in the 1850s , poor farmers , fishermen , and unemployed drifters from Xinning ( today 's Taishan County ) in Guangdong Province , searching for a path of survival or improvement for their families , crossed the sea to Australia . There they settled in places like Adelaide , Bendigo , and Ballarat on the east coast , and in the mountain areas of Queensland state , hoping to fulfill their gold-panning dreams .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased . This was a space built by the Chinese gold workers and business people of those bygone days as their resting place for the afterlife . It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
Inside the main door is a Guan Gong statue niche decorated with embroidered cloth . In front is an altar for offerings , and votive items are lined up on it . In front of the altar , on a red background using gold thread , is a table-wrap depicting two dragons playing with pearls , two phoenixes flying toward the sun and a hanging embroidered with the words " support righteousness and destroy evil . "  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds . Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time . In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang-sheng and Lin Yen-hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men 's singles .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
So that both citizens of Taiwan and foreigners studying Chinese here wo n't misunderstand and misuse the term " black gold , " which has long been properly used to describe iron , oil and coal ( as my research has demonstrated ) , I hope that instead of " sweeping away black gold " the government will " sweep away the corrupting influence in politics of money from organized crime and the wealthy . "  
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers ( as used in Chinese knotting ) along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland . As I put it on the premier I explained that these were lucky colors used for Chinese New Year . She was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in Chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water . Whether sold domestically or exported , Pinglin 's Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels . Both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90% of the people of Pinglin , life revolves around tea .  
There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Because the paper is impermeable , after the overall composition has been sketched out the artist applies layer after layer of expensive pigments-ground crystal , blue chalcedony , emerald green-with the gold base left uncovered to provide the linear sketch elements of the painting .  
I wore a bright red Chinese jacket with gold embroidery and took the cotton-stuffed jacket that my son had worn as a tot . I also took a " watermelon cap " ( gua pi mao ) to show the kids . If you 've ever been to a gift shop where they sell typical Chinese souvenirs , you will have seen a watermelon cap . It consists of six triangular pieces of brightly colored cloth sewn into a round little cap .  
There are a dazzling variety of intricately shaped sacred turtle images large and small , with past and present examples that include an enormous rice turtle weighing 8000 Taiwanese catties ( 4800 kg ) , a solid-gold electric turtle made of 230 taels ( about 8.6 kg ) of gold , and " money turtles " made up of stacks of shiny new coins . But whatever the form , all carry the same message : hope for a beautiful life in the new year .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
For the background he mixed in over 30 bags of gold powder in order to convey the golden light of dawn . On the pond he painted azure lotuses with their red blooms just beginning to unfold , with an egret wading and searching for food . Yu gave the soft tranquility of the lotus pool a colorful vitality .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
However , after World War I began , Japan began to develop gold and coal mining on a large-scale in Taiwan , for two main reasons . First , Japan at that point had the second-largest naval fleet in the world , requiring huge amounts of coal . In addition , Japan had to import most of its strategic materials , and in those days international trade was still gold-based , requiring gold to purchase products from abroad .  
Meanwhile , the hot igneous rock combined with the heated underground water combined to form hydrothermal fluids , which , as result of the prevailing high temperature and high pressure , included large amounts of dissolved metals . After these fluids percolated upward through faults , as temperature and pressure declined , the metal ions percolated into cracks and into fissures in the surrounding rock . In the places where accumulations reached a certain volume , gold veins took shape . Bringing prosperity back  
After the gold veins of the took shape , they were raised upward as the land surface rose . Within the last million years , erosion effects have gradually exposed the gold to the surface , and gold particles from shallow veins have been washed into rivers . It was possible to run across gold in the Keelung River , which is how it was discovered in the first place .  
Boasting a total of over 200 Tang-era pieces that range from tricolor glazed pottery , ceramics , gold and silver works , glassware , and Buddhist relics , the exhibit assembles prized pieces from 12 museums in the mainland 's Shaanxi province . This is the most exhaustive and diverse single-dynasty exhibit to come along in recent years , and is something you do n't want to pass up .  
The contents of the exhibit can be divided into four categories . First are the splendid and ornate gold and silver pieces of the Tang dynasty royal family , followed by the tricolor glaze pottery and ceramic pieces that were used by the ordinary folk of that time . Then there are the Buddhist and Taoist statues that evoke the Tang 's flourishing and diverse religious environment .  
One of his happier finds was a map of Formosa created in 1940 by a famous cartographer . It was an extremely important find , for this was the very map that became the standard for subsequent cartography on Taiwan . Surprisingly , van der Aalsvoort found it tucked away , old and tattered , between the pages of a book . He said it was like running across a nugget of pure gold in a tossed salad .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
Once you reduce its thickness to 50 nanometers , light can easily pass through it , so that it no longer reflects light . Its color changes from gold to red , and it becomes an excellent material for pregnancy test kits . Once gold is manufactured as thin as 50 nanometers , it goes from being extremely stable to being extremely volatile , allowing it to be used in many different applications as a catalyst or activator .  
Ciqing paper is dyed with indigo to the same deep blue as appears on blue-and-white porcelain . In ancient times in China this paper was used for copying Buddhist scriptures with gold paste ink . It expressed the solemn dignity of the religious texts especially well .  
This is why in ancient times ciqing paper was extremely rare and valuable . In the Ming dynasty , one sheet could be exchanged for ten catties of white flour . When the Qing emperor Qianlong ( reigned 1736-1795 ) had his prime minister Liu Luoguo ( familiar to Taiwanese TV audiences from a mainland drama series ) transcribe Buddhist scriptures as a birthday present for his empress , Liu wrote them in gold paste on ciqing paper .  
The spending figures officially reported by Mayor Hsieh 's campaign headquarters did not exceed the legal limit , but the spending report noted that Hsieh 's reelection committee spent NT $ 70-80 million . The Kaohsiung City Election Commission , following established precedent , was only able to levy a paltry fine of NT $ 100,000 . In addition to amending the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , there is a pressing need to enact legislation that will stamp out black gold corruption and provide for greater transparency .

On the ground in front of the Sanching altar was laid a straw mat with a bagua pattern . The Daoist priest Li Chi-chang used white rice to form a dragon on the mat , with eggs as its eyes , two large bowls as its mouth and nose , rolled-up paper spirit money as its ears and horns , and sticks of fragrant wood as its whiskers . What 's more , the Paoan Temple especially forged 108 heavy gold coins to be the scales of the dragon .  
The folk totems in the painstakingly executed works of potter Li Hsing-lung rearrange traditional linear patterns , transforming them into symbols , resulting in entirely new creations uniquely representative of the culture from which they sprang .

Before applying the gold leaf , they 've got to first apply some glue designed for that purpose : " You 've got to precisely control the time that the gold leaf glue dries , because that will affect on the quality of the gold leaf . If it 's too wet , it 's difficult to spread evenly ; if it 's too dry , it wo n't stick . "  
Below the 75-ft ( 22.86 m ) high base of the shallow dome , wood-slatted panels , interrupted by a wash of gold from ceiling to podium , descend against the outwardly tilted wall to the blue and green decor of the 165-ft ( 50.29 m ) long by 115-ft ( 35.05 m ) wide Hall .

Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
A few of the innumerable examples include the Pegasus cyanide heap-leach gold mine in Montana , which is adjacent to Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribal territories , the massive Black Mesa coal mine on lands sacred to the Dineh and Hopi peoples in Big Mountain , Arizona , the extreme levels of contamination caused by Shell Oil on Ogoni traditional lands in Nigeria , and the gold-mining and uranium-drilling in the sacred Black Hills in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the Lakota Nation and the United States .

After the sugar coating was licked off , what one may taste was only the bitterness inside .  If the voters are aware of the sugar coating and the packing , then they should know that even though opposing dark gold politics , restoring law and order , and reforming government were all what they required , if these objectives were to be achieved only by means of establishing a so-called Taiwan people 's state , then nothing would really be accomplished .

The set of the drama was designed by famous Taiwan architect Deng Kuen-yen .  Deng demonstrates his exceptional creativity and sheer perfection of aesthetics in literature and arts of the Sung Dynasty in his set design .

Halfway up the slope of a mountain on the Chiufen-Shuanghsi road rests a silent wooden workers ' hut . Chiufen resident Lin Hsin-hsiung takes us up a section of road and into the hut . This hut is built next to an unobtrusive and ordinary mine pit opening , and were it not for the gold panning paraphernalia just outside it would be hard to tell that this was indeed a gold mine .  
In one powerful effort he set a new national record with a combined snatch and clean-and-jerk of 267.5 kilos .

Most of the houses are situated along the scenic banks of the Charles River , each with a different color cupola : glittering gold , bright green , vermilion . . . a truly charming sight when seen from a distance .  
Thereafter , enticed by financial inducements or simply duped into going , millions of coolies accepted a modest payment and contracted to work for a limited period in tin mines or in the rubber , tea and sugar plantations of Southeast Asia .

And it was in the T'ang period that the vogue started for literary men to stamp calligraphy and paintings with chops . Early chops were carved by craftsmen and tend to have a workaday air , and they were generally made from jade , gold , bronze or iron .

With intricate carving and gold paint , the entire temple is extremely ornate and is called the best in all of Malaysia .  
Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !  
To one side Sakuliu was explaining the significance of the clothing : That one is embroidered with a butterfly , symbolizing fleetness of foot , since he has won a gold medal in the Taiwan area athletic meet ; that one is embroidered with an animal , showing clearly that he is hunting champion , as he has hunted down more than five mountain boars ; those girls are wearing lilies on their heads , indicating that all the women in their family have maintained good reputations . . . .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
It is just that if you look at metals such as gold and iron , the former is extremely rare and inert and can not easily undergo chemical changes through combining with other materials , while the latter is used in huge quantities but is actually needed by the human body - - medics even recommend that we use iron cooking pots so as to provide us with supplementary iron .  
He saw that Taiwan might be an excellent market , so he brought along masters of all of a funeral 's " affiliated industries , " including monks , Taoist priests , carpenters and wood carvers , painters , and makers of incense and of symbolic gold and silver paper money . He gave each of them a substantial payment to insure financial security for their families , and then - - more than 100 strong - - they imposingly crossed the sea to Taiwan to open a new world .  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
On the heels of economic reform , the mainland has been pushing hard to increase its foreign exchange , and so the Pu'er tea grown in Yunnan , where most production is centered , has gradually become familiar to Westerners .

" In mainland China in the past , most ordinary people were very poor , and if they got a little money they would buy land or gold . Especially during the war with Japan , when there was roaring inflation and paper money lost its worth within days , there was no choice but to buy things of value , " says economist Wang Tso-jung . Rice takes up a lot of space , while by comparison gold is portable and easy to store , so that many people preferred to buy gold .  
At that time , countries all over the world operated on the gold standard , and gold was also required for international trade . It was partly thanks to this shipment of gold that Taiwan , which only had commodities such as tea and sugar to export and which relied on imports for all manufactured goods , was gradually able to transform itself from an agricultural to an industrial society , and to go from having a massive trade deficit to holding foreign exchange reserves which now rank among the world 's largest .  
The 18th-Century novel The Dream of the Red Chamber describes how Chia Paoyu was born with a piece of lustrous jade in his mouth , while Hsueh Pao-chai wore around her neck a " golden chain of longevity . " These should have fated them to be joined in a " blessed union of gold and jade . "  
In the early years , the Japanese sealed off the mountain areas in order to weaken Taiwan 's ability to resist their power , but after detailed exploration by the Japanese government , gold was mined in large quantities from 1897onwards . It is estimated that the main veins were all worked out within less than 20 years . All this gold was shipped back to Japan , where it became a major source of finance for the imperial army 's purchases of military equipment from abroad .  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
For instance , some factories only carve all kinds of Bodhidarma figures , while others specialize in human figures , or birds and animals , and so on . " Collective creation on a production line " is also a widespread method . To take a religious statue as an example , after the rough wooden blank has been cut out , the carving of its face , hands , curves and background , the application of gold leaf and other operations are all the responsibility of different specialists .  
But during the exhibition the year before last of works by Monet , 300,000 people pressed into the gallery .

Among them are pictorial ceramic panels by Sun Chao and wood and gold carvings by Wu Ching . "  
The situation was becoming intolerable , and after much thought one of Augustus ' courtiers , von Tschirnhausen , who was an amateur alchemist , concluded there were only two ways to solve this thorny problem : one was to find a way to transmute base metals into gold , so the emperor could buy porcelain to his heart 's content ; the other was to go to the root of the problem by finding the secret of making porcelain !

At its eaves were bells which rang continuously in the breeze .  
Lumps of hard black stuff with metal legs , containing many tiny crystals .

It is said that in popular belief the Chinese narcissus , with its white petals and yellow cup , not only represents harmony of yin and yang and good fortune , but its likeness to a gold cup on a silver stand has always made it a symbol of wealth too . Who can say that it was not appropriate for the Tang emperor to use bowls made of precious metals and gems with their matching flowers of good omen as a gift for his beloved beauty ?  
Shih Yun-chung carefully tells of his ancestor 's merit , while pointing out the ornamental courtly insignia depicted in fine and colorful detail on the painting ; the long fingernails , demonstrating that this was a person who did n't need to do any heavy manual labor ; and the gold flake decoration which is seen on many parts of the picture , are all details which combine to proclaim the awesome glory of the Shih family 's power in former days .  
After the head is drawn , the portrait master will need to add a long robe or a suit for the men , a Chinese or Western dress for the ladies .

Although under the pens of literati since the Tang and Song , this fairy visitor among flowers had been washed clean of all connection with the vulgar mortal world , for the common people the osmanthus symbolized gold and jade , fame and fortune , and success at every level in the imperial examinations . So in the end even the literati could not escape the mundane .  
In the deep of night the flowers might be sleeping , but as every minute of spring is to be treasured like gold , why not light some candles and spread some lanterns to illuminate a night-time banquet , and pass the time in their company ?  
In ancient times , before the invention of plastic , lacquer was valued for shining like gold or pearls , and for being a surface in which gold , silver , pearls and jewels could be set and fine decorative lines could be carved . It was therefore loved by emperors and nobility . At times the use of lacquer ware by emperors fueled charges of extravagance . Over the course of history many of the processes for making lacquer ware have been quite complex .  
" For every ten people who come to me for authentication , nine end up disappointed and leave mad , " says Ted Cheng , executive manager of Buddhist Chen De Plaza , who helped to stir up the rage for dZi beads in the early days and became famous last year when he was commissioned to make a gold throne for the Dalai Lama to use in Taiwan .

I would say half of the assemblymen and legislators in Taiwan have some connection to organized crime , " said Lee Yuan-tseh , Nobel prize winner and now president of the Academia Sinica , addressing a seminar held in September to discuss the political situation .  
As for the imperial clubs , according to The Book of Chuiwan they were edged with pure gold , inlaid with jade , and their shafts sumptuously decorated . When their majesties had finished playing , their equipment was not put away in bags , but placed in brocaded cases . Even today 's top-flight golf clubs , which sell for NT $ 800-900,000 a set , would look pretty shabby next to kit like this .  
Whether they are forced to travel to this distant country by a life of poverty at home , or they have come to roam remote lands , hearts brimming with ambition for the future , all foreign laborers that come to work in Taiwan dream of returning with a purse filled up with gold .  
The results show that the people of Taiwan believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " black gold politics " ( the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , and raising economic competitiveness .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
Clearly , one can not ignore the economic miracle and political democratization created over the last half-century , but there are also problems of " black gold " politics , a growing gap between rich and poor , and environmental destruction .  
New Premier Tang Fei is well aware that the public has high expectations and will brook no delay . He chaired his first cabinet meeting on his fourth day in office , and issued a list of six focal points : improving cross-strait relations , eradicating " black gold " ( the influence of criminals and moneyed interests in politics ) , hastening earthquake reconstruction , creating a new economic miracle , deepening education reform and cultural development , and " reinventing " government .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
" The KMT lost because it was divided and because of the ' black gold ' issue , and not on account of its administrative track record , " says KMT legislator Chen Shei-saint . Viewed alongside the performance of the world 's other perennial ruling parties , the KMT 's record has been pretty good , with brisk economic growth in spite of environmental protests and the difficulties of industrial upgrading .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
When one talks of Chinese architecture , what people are probably most familiar with is multi-layered dougong block-and-bracket structures under flying eaves , and vermilion pillars supporting square-paneled " caisson " ceilings painted with dragon-and-phoenix designs in gold , green and a rainbow of other colors-the " palatial " style .  
When news of the gold rush in Australia reached China in the 1850s , poor farmers , fishermen , and unemployed drifters from Xinning ( today 's Taishan County ) in Guangdong Province , searching for a path of survival or improvement for their families , crossed the sea to Australia . There they settled in places like Adelaide , Bendigo , and Ballarat on the east coast , and in the mountain areas of Queensland state , hoping to fulfill their gold-panning dreams .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased .

It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
Inside the main door is a Guan Gong statue niche decorated with embroidered cloth . In front is an altar for offerings , and votive items are lined up on it . In front of the altar , on a red background using gold thread , is a table-wrap depicting two dragons playing with pearls , two phoenixes flying toward the sun and a hanging embroidered with the words " support righteousness and destroy evil . "  
Because Lien was the only candidate , his election was a foregone conclusion . In his opening speech to the meeting , Lien had especially emphasized that the KMT defeat in the presidential election was due to its own mistakes , so that the most important task for the party at the moment was to eliminate " black gold " ( the influence of crime and moneyed interests in the party ) and to clean up its political act .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
Q : As you yourself have mentioned , underworld figures often launder their public image by getting involved in politics , and it is extremely difficult to do anything about it . Previous Justice Ministers Liao Cheng-hao and Ma Ying-jeou both had excellent reputations as able and incorruptible men , yet neither was able to overcome the influence of black gold . It almost looks like " mission impossible . " Do you feel confident of your ability to carry out this mission ?  
During the festivities , which were both moving and fun , tribal elders sang warrior songs and praised Chiang for his glorious deeds . Meanwhile , the ROC table tennis team twice made it to the finals , but fell just short of the gold each time . In the wheelchair men 's doubles class 5 event , Chou Chang-sheng and Lin Yen-hung took the silver , while Chou won another silver in the men 's singles .  
And a month earlier the Executive Yuan handed the legislature a draft amendment to the Election and Recall Law that is designed to block mob-affiliated individuals from running for public office . It is hoped that the combination of executive and legislative measures will finally drive " black gold " out of Taiwanese politics . Cracking down on crime and stamping out " black gold " politics remains a central plank of the new government 's platform .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
So that both citizens of Taiwan and foreigners studying Chinese here wo n't misunderstand and misuse the term " black gold , " which has long been properly used to describe iron , oil and coal ( as my research has demonstrated ) , I hope that instead of " sweeping away black gold " the government will " sweep away the corrupting influence in politics of money from organized crime and the wealthy . "  
I used scarlet silk cord and miniature embroidered Chinese slippers ( as used in Chinese knotting ) along with dried flowers , to make a red and gold garland . As I put it on the premier I explained that these were lucky colors used for Chinese New Year . She was delighted with this beautiful souvenir , rich in Chinese culture and art , and said she would keep it forever .  
The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea , with their green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when steeped in hot water . Whether sold domestically or exported , Pinglin 's Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels .

There is still a long way to go before E . vermicola can be developed into a biocontrol for the pine wood nematode . But this fungus , which the electron microscope reveals to have a stalk like a mushroom and a cap shaped like a traditional Chinese gold or silver ingot , is just as much an endemic species , unique to Taiwan , as the treasured Formosan sika deer or Formosan landlocked salmon .  
Because the paper is impermeable , after the overall composition has been sketched out the artist applies layer after layer of expensive pigments-ground crystal , blue chalcedony , emerald green-with the gold base left uncovered to provide the linear sketch elements of the painting .  
I wore a bright red Chinese jacket with gold embroidery and took the cotton-stuffed jacket that my son had worn as a tot . I also took a " watermelon cap " ( gua pi mao ) to show the kids . If you 've ever been to a gift shop where they sell typical Chinese souvenirs , you will have seen a watermelon cap . It consists of six triangular pieces of brightly colored cloth sewn into a round little cap .  
There are a dazzling variety of intricately shaped sacred turtle images large and small , with past and present examples that include an enormous rice turtle weighing 8000 Taiwanese catties ( 4800 kg ) , a solid-gold electric turtle made of 230 taels ( about 8.6 kg ) of gold , and " money turtles " made up of stacks of shiny new coins . But whatever the form , all carry the same message : hope for a beautiful life in the new year .  
This year , someone who had a lucky year over the previous year offered the temple 230 taels ( 8.6 kilos ) of gold . The temple decided to break up that amount and make a family of one large and three small golden turtles which would be open to qigui for the public . In front of the temple they even built a clever little landscape garden where the four golden turtles can live a leisurely existence .  
For the background he mixed in over 30 bags of gold powder in order to convey the golden light of dawn . On the pond he painted azure lotuses with their red blooms just beginning to unfold , with an egret wading and searching for food . Yu gave the soft tranquility of the lotus pool a colorful vitality .  
Adventurers ' paradise Today , you can visit many places in Chinkuashih and Chiufen left behind by the gold mining era . There is the perfectly preserved 300-ping Prince Hotel , and you can climb up to the Golden Shinto Shrine , both built in the Japanese colonial era . You can also be lowered by rope into Mt . Pen Shaft # 5 , one of the most important mines , and imagine the darkened faces of the miners as they pushed carts in and out of the dark pits .  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
However , after World War I began , Japan began to develop gold and coal mining on a large-scale in Taiwan , for two main reasons . First , Japan at that point had the second-largest naval fleet in the world , requiring huge amounts of coal . In addition , Japan had to import most of its strategic materials , and in those days international trade was still gold-based , requiring gold to purchase products from abroad .  
Meanwhile , the hot igneous rock combined with the heated underground water combined to form hydrothermal fluids , which , as result of the prevailing high temperature and high pressure , included large amounts of dissolved metals . After these fluids percolated upward through faults , as temperature and pressure declined , the metal ions percolated into cracks and into fissures in the surrounding rock . In the places where accumulations reached a certain volume , gold veins took shape . Bringing prosperity back  
After the gold veins of the took shape , they were raised upward as the land surface rose . Within the last million years , erosion effects have gradually exposed the gold to the surface , and gold particles from shallow veins have been washed into rivers . It was possible to run across gold in the Keelung River , which is how it was discovered in the first place .  
Boasting a total of over 200 Tang-era pieces that range from tricolor glazed pottery , ceramics , gold and silver works , glassware , and Buddhist relics , the exhibit assembles prized pieces from 12 museums in the mainland 's Shaanxi province . This is the most exhaustive and diverse single-dynasty exhibit to come along in recent years , and is something you do n't want to pass up .  
The contents of the exhibit can be divided into four categories . First are the splendid and ornate gold and silver pieces of the Tang dynasty royal family , followed by the tricolor glaze pottery and ceramic pieces that were used by the ordinary folk of that time . Then there are the Buddhist and Taoist statues that evoke the Tang 's flourishing and diverse religious environment .  
One of his happier finds was a map of Formosa created in 1940 by a famous cartographer . It was an extremely important find , for this was the very map that became the standard for subsequent cartography on Taiwan . Surprisingly , van der Aalsvoort found it tucked away , old and tattered , between the pages of a book . He said it was like running across a nugget of pure gold in a tossed salad .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
Once you reduce its thickness to 50 nanometers , light can easily pass through it , so that it no longer reflects light . Its color changes from gold to red , and it becomes an excellent material for pregnancy test kits . Once gold is manufactured as thin as 50 nanometers , it goes from being extremely stable to being extremely volatile , allowing it to be used in many different applications as a catalyst or activator .  
Ciqing paper is dyed with indigo to the same deep blue as appears on blue-and-white porcelain . In ancient times in China this paper was used for copying Buddhist scriptures with gold paste ink . It expressed the solemn dignity of the religious texts especially well .  
This is why in ancient times ciqing paper was extremely rare and valuable . In the Ming dynasty , one sheet could be exchanged for ten catties of white flour . When the Qing emperor Qianlong ( reigned 1736-1795 ) had his prime minister Liu Luoguo ( familiar to Taiwanese TV audiences from a mainland drama series ) transcribe Buddhist scriptures as a birthday present for his empress , Liu wrote them in gold paste on ciqing paper .  
The spending figures officially reported by Mayor Hsieh 's campaign headquarters did not exceed the legal limit , but the spending report noted that Hsieh 's reelection committee spent NT $ 70-80 million . The Kaohsiung City Election Commission , following established precedent , was only able to levy a paltry fine of NT $ 100,000 . In addition to amending the Public Officials Election and Recall Law , there is a pressing need to enact legislation that will stamp out black gold corruption and provide for greater transparency .  
The graves show that the Shihsanhang people buried their dead lying on their side , knees bent . The body was usually positioned with the head to the southwest , perhaps for cultural or religious reasons . Pottery , pearl ornaments , and gold objects accompanied the body in the grave .  
On the ground in front of the Sanching altar was laid a straw mat with a bagua pattern . The Daoist priest Li Chi-chang used white rice to form a dragon on the mat , with eggs as its eyes , two large bowls as its mouth and nose , rolled-up paper spirit money as its ears and horns , and sticks of fragrant wood as its whiskers . What 's more , the Paoan Temple especially forged 108 heavy gold coins to be the scales of the dragon .  
The folk totems in the painstakingly executed works of potter Li Hsing-lung rearrange traditional linear patterns , transforming them into symbols , resulting in entirely new creations uniquely representative of the culture from which they sprang . Bearing gold , red , blue , and indigo colors typical of Eastern art , Li 's works are redolent of the Orient , and of Taiwan in particular .  
Having decided to use gold as his creative medium , Wu set to work , using 99.99% pure gold that lacked the silver or copper that goldsmiths traditionally add to make welding easier ( but that in time cause oxidation , with the silver turning black and the copper green ) .  
A pair of long wooden carved tablets reads : " The courageous and magnificent one answers prayers and silently grants safe sailing across the sea to this strange land ; loyal to the brilliant deity , we return home with found treasure . " The couplet is a gold miner 's prayer .  
After these decorative lines are dry , they spray on a layer of yellow paint , and then add gold leaf . Before applying the gold leaf , they 've got to first apply some glue designed for that purpose : " You 've got to precisely control the time that the gold leaf glue dries , because that will affect on the quality of the gold leaf . If it 's too wet , it 's difficult to spread evenly ; if it 's too dry , it wo n't stick . "  
Below the 75-ft ( 22.86 m ) high base of the shallow dome , wood-slatted panels , interrupted by a wash of gold from ceiling to podium , descend against the outwardly tilted wall to the blue and green decor of the 165-ft ( 50.29 m ) long by 115-ft ( 35.05 m ) wide Hall .  
Further , over 40 Member States already have agreed to issue legal tender coins honouring the anniversary , pursuant to the provisions of General Assembly resolution 49 / 11 .  In addition to gold and silver coins for collectors , a number of base metal coins will be issued at face value for general circulation .

It is expected that the level of foreign investment in the gold mining industry of the country by the year 2000 will then far exceed US $ 1-billion and this will make it possible to double the current gold production of 80 tons to 160 tons , leading Uzbekistan to the rank of the five top gold producers in the world .  
Non-bank financial institutions include a wide variety of exchange houses , cheque-cashing services , insurers , mortgagers , brokers , importers , exporters , trading companies , gold and precious metal dealers , casinos , express delivery services and other money movers of varying degrees of sophistication and capability , and other underground banking systems .  
Besides being of great scientific importance for studies of active geological processes in deep ocean basins , including plate tectonics , as well as climate studies , the map has proved of commercial value : already , fishermen use it to locate seamounts that produce upwellings of deep , nutrient-rich water that in turn supports abundant living resources ; industries use it to find the kinds of rocks that overlay oilfields and the kinds of volcanic eruptions that form undersea deposits of copper , iron , silver and gold .  
A few of the innumerable examples include the Pegasus cyanide heap-leach gold mine in Montana , which is adjacent to Gros Ventre and Assiniboine tribal territories , the massive Black Mesa coal mine on lands sacred to the Dineh and Hopi peoples in Big Mountain , Arizona , the extreme levels of contamination caused by Shell Oil on Ogoni traditional lands in Nigeria , and the gold-mining and uranium-drilling in the sacred Black Hills in violation of the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty between the Lakota Nation and the United States .  
Moreover , Japan had attempted to obliterate the national culture and also plundered hundreds of billions of dollars worth of gold , silver , mineral , coal , grain , livestock and cultural assets .  
The EU stresses its concern at the use of diamonds , gold and other resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to fund military operations in the region , and calls on all the parties to ensure that all commercial dealings of this nature are legal under the relevant domestic and international law , transparent , consistent with States ' arrangements with the international financing institutions , and benefit the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and not private individuals .
