For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
In the " Alma Ata Declaration " , leaders of the five countries explicitly expressed their common position of opposing the national separatist force and the religious extremist forces , jointly cracking down on international terrorists , organized crimes , drug-trafficking , smuggling , and other transnational criminal activities .  They all agreed that they would not allow any people to use their own territories to carry out activities detrimental to the state sovereignty , security , and social order of another country .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
Taking advantage of the complex social factors and the transnational geological condition in the Feiergan valley , international terrorist forces repeatedly carried out terrorist activities in Kyrgyzstan and south Uzbekistan in 1999 and 2000 .  In addition , due to the various political effects from both inside and outside the region , relevant countries and the whole Eurasian area face unprecedented threats to stability .  
He said , overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have transnational culture , and there are also many specialized talented people among them ; there are more than 100,000 highly talented Chinese in science and technology and various specialities in North America ; this is advantageous for the United States in opening up the China market , for China 's economic construction , and for ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese to develop their business .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
In the field of regional issues , the two sides emphasized the adoption of active and effective measures to crack down on national splittist , international terrorist , religious extremist , and transnational criminal activities .  
Increasingly , Xinjiang 's ethnic separatist forces abroad have tended to join forces in launching attacks , replacing scattered operations with regional operations , and even with transregional , transnational , multi-level , and joint operations , and such an initial tendency may be viewed at the following three levels : 
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
Second , continuous efforts should be made to crack down on religious extremist forces , ethnic secessionist forces , international terrorism and other transnational crimes that endanger regional stability and security .  
The proposal stressed : The four countries in the region will conduct multilateral scientific , technological , and economic cooperation in animal husbandry , planting , ecologically non-destructive mining industry , and transnational tourist industry .  They will strive to gain the support of the international community for the region , and import capital , qualified personnel , and technologies for the development of the region .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .  Meanwhile , we have worked out a host of preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the central and western regions , with a view to restructuring the industries and regions that use foreign capital .  
He said : Further efforts to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries and their militaries in all fields , and joint efforts to strike at ethnic splittism that seriously threaten the stability of relevant nations and regional security , international terrorism , religious extremist forces , and transnational criminal activities , conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples , and are of great significance to safeguarding peace , stability , and development in this region .  
Both foreign ministers also exchanged opinions on increasing bilateral cooperation in the fields of information technology industry , environmental protection , developing China 's western region , and cracking down on transnational organizational crimes .  They reached consensus of opinion extensively .  
In response to some important issues with common interests in both the Asian side and the European side , the Chinese Government proposed the holding an Asia-Europe environmental ministerial meeting , carrying out scientific and technological cooperation in Asian and European forest protection and sustainable development , and holding a seminar of Asian and European law enforcement institutions on cracking down on transnational crimes .  These proposals also won support from various Asian and European countries .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .  
The three proposals made by Zhu Rongji at the meeting regarding the further expansion of Asia-Europe cooperation in economic , trade , scientific and technological , and other spheres , the joint efforts to crack down on transnational crime and corruption , and the strengthening of cooperation in environmental protection and sustainable development were unanimously approved by the leaders of various countries and written into the document of the " Asia-Europe Cooperation Framework 2000 . "  
Zhu Rongji pointed out : The problems such as illegal immigration , sneaky intrusion into other countries , and so on exist in many countries , which is the transnational crime committed by international criminal groups and must be cracked down on with joint efforts .  
While the international community is facing daily increase in global problems , it is necessary for all countries , including China and France , to make concerted efforts and strengthen cooperation in protecting the environment and combating drug trafficking , illegal immigration and transnational organized crimes .  
On the other hand , aiming at the goal of ultimately becoming an extraordinarily large high-tech transnational group with fairly strong competitiveness , actively develop external economic relations and carry out business expansion on the international scene and export of technologies and labor service to make the contributions expected of us in enabling China 's aerospace [ industry ] to rank among the first in the world .  
Jeffrey Koo said : Advanced countries do not have many restrictions regarding sending back the investment made by transnational companies .  A long time ago when Taiwan did not have an ample foreign exchange reserve , it set a requirement , setting a yearly limit for Taiwan businessmen to remit money to foreign countries .  According to China 's current financial system , it is difficult for Taiwan businessmen to remit their profits back to Taiwan .  
the WTO requires various member countries , whether large or small , to implement the principle of nondiscriminating trade treatment ; a legal system and good market order are a regular way to attract international investment , especially investment from transnational corporations , and the practice of relying on preferential policies and special regional treatment to attracting foreign investment will be no longer effective ;  
The meeting just concluded was a great success .  It provided WCO Member administrations in the region with a valuable opportunity to share their views on a wide range of Customs subjects , including , the application of international instrument for trade facilitation , strengthening of enforcement capability in combating transnational crimes such as Amphetamine Type Stimulants ( ATS ) and internet piracy , promotion of multilateral co-operation for mutual administrative assistance and out-reaching with the business sector for partnership .  
On Police commitment in tackling crimes attributable to triad activities , Mr Tsang said a total of 2 472 persons were arrested for a variety of triad related offences .  " At the same time , Police devoted great efforts in fighting cross-border organised crimes .  Hong Kong Police will in March 2002 host an international conference on transnational organised crime which will be attended by prominent members of law enforcement agencies from across the Globe .  
Market Expansion : Money is rolling in at these companies that match people up , the credit for which really belongs to those far-sighted entrepreneurs who broadened the " market . " Besides serving the young unmarried men and women of Taiwan , there are now introductions for friendship and marriage across the Taiwan Straits , as well as transnational special columns for Chinese abroad ; the age levels have been broadened to include the " second spring " of divorced or widowed persons , as well as " September romances " for the silver haired set .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
He says that at present , unclear policies and sporadic services result in serious problems such foreign wives failing to adjust well to their surroundings , domestic violence , children doing poorly in school , and bogus marriages that are actually a cover for prostitution . According to Lin , the government urgently needs to address the growing social problems and costs arising from transnational marriages .  
China 's market has great potential and faces fierce competition , while Switzerland has many powerful transnational corporations and a large number of small and medium sized companies with unique and professional technology Therefore , the prospects for further development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation are promising  
The expansion of transnational corporation activities world wide calls for adequate governmental response , which , in the successful pursuit of national policies in an interdependent world , requires a global view .  
Another major obstacle is the broad range of activities in which transnational crime is involved , which are not always covered or sanctioned by existing criminal legislation .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
While the principle of the severity of the offence is sound in view of the need to address the multitude of activities engaged in by organized transnational criminal groups , further elaboration is needed in the light of the differing national perceptions of the severity of individual offences .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
Seminars and workshops on the functions and impact of international , regional and bilateral arrangements ; country experience studies ; harmonization of foreign direct investment reporting systems ; incorporation of sustainable development management practices into national policies ; and enhancement of national strategies for sustainable development as they relate to transnational corporations .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
They included " Action against national and transnational economic and organized crime and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment : national experiences and international cooperation " , which was considered in a plenary session , with a special session on corruption .  
They call for the development of an empirical base of knowledge on the nature , dynamics and operations of new sophisticated and diversified forms of transnational organized , economic and environmental crime that pose a particular threat , and on their linkages with terrorist violence , corruption and money-laundering .  
The 142 States present at the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Crime proclaimed their political will and strong determination , as well as their unequivocal commitment , to ensure the full and expeditious implementation of the Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , reflecting the urgency and priority attention attached to action against organized transnational crime .  
To implement their commitments in the fight against transnational organized crime , they established a group of senior experts , with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , to identify significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
The threat posed to the internal security and stability of sovereign States , as well as to international security , by the dramatic increase of organized transnational crime in the past decade is growing and will continue to grow and become more menacing if concerted and decisive action on the part of the international community is delayed .  
While energies have to be focused and action planned in the best and most efficient manner , the ultimate goals of effectively preventing and controlling organized transnational crime in all its forms and dimensions , and arresting its expansion at both the national and international levels , should be guiding the relevant efforts and should constitute the yardstick against which success is to be assessed .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
Academic institutions and professional associations have a major role to play in accumulating theoretical knowledge on organized transnational crime and in disseminating this knowledge , in close cooperation with governmental agencies and the education system , as well as in concert with the media , non-governmental organizations and the private sector .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Provision of the information and materials requested by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 11 would permit the undertaking of a comprehensive and comparative study of the situation in the various regions of the world , thus contributing to the achievement of the goal of improving reliable knowledge on organized transnational crime , its structure and dynamics .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .  
The results of the study would also be used for the development of special programmes , courses and curriculums for academic institutions , to ensure that theoretical knowledge is increased , improved and disseminated , and to create the basis for long-term and consistent action against organized transnational crime .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
As we approach the next millennium and as the pre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the definition of national sovereignty , we must seriously question why a powerful minority is still allowed to bankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow economic and political needs .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
The uncharted waters ahead remain daunting , defined by bilious seas of unrelenting , sophisticated , transnational criminal activity , which is tearing at the very fabric of society .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Reaffirms the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality and to assist Member States in achieving the goals of preventing crime within and among States and improving the response to crime , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46 / 152 and in line with the recommendations of the Ninth Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders ;  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
Should the Commission be satisfied with the nature and amount of information presented thus far , and bearing in mind the legislative and policy pronouncements made by the General Assembly and the Council and its subsidiary bodies , it might wish to specify practical measures for an international course of action to guide States in combating an increasingly acute criminological phenomenon of transnational dimension .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
One successor State reported that it adhered to all international treaties , and made proposals to the police of other countries to sign new bilateral agreements , particularly on cooperation in combating all types of transnational crime , such as organized crime , drug trafficking and economic and financial crime .  
Deregulation processes , new technologies , advancements in telecommunications and the creation of expanded economic spaces and market liberalization have had major implications on the development process , and have induced sizable productivity increases and new opportunities for profits , not only for the legal economy , but also , for organized transnational crime , which coexisted with , and benefited by , the legal economy .  
Regulators , money-laundering investigators and international policy-making bodies are facing profound challenges from a banking world which not only knows no geographic horizons and is open 24 hours a day , but is increasingly interconnected , as large transnational banks extend their reach not only through branch and subsidiary networks , but through correspondent relationships that cross the globe .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime , taking into account the capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network .  
Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
47 The central theme in all the information provided by States on this subject is the need to further enhance international cooperation which , if integrated with national efforts , will form a comprehensive strategy against organized transnational crime .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Since the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan have made a strong statement on behalf of the world community and have already drawn attention to this pressing issue , the focus should be on implementation and development of other practical measures and instruments to combat organized transnational crime .  NULLIn the view of Cuba , in order to combat organized transnational crime it is not enough to merely establish or even ratify various regional or international instruments .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
Italy is of the opinion that the effectiveness of the implementation of the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan will be maximized if , while advancing the process of elaborating a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , a group of highly qualified national experts develop specific recommendations , which could be immediately implemented at the national level .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .  
Meeting the challenge requires the allocation of commensurate resources by the international community and the maintenance of a strong collective political will , keeping in mind that no State can afford to be complacent in responding to organized transnational crime .  
The Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , complemented by the action already taken by the Commission at its fourth session , have set in motion a process of increased awareness of the threat posed by organized transnational crime and of the need for urgent action at the national and international levels .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
38 The Holy See suggested that the Congress should focus on the development of new international legal instruments and forms of international jurisdiction to combat transnational crime linked to : speculative financial transactions severely harming the economy of one or more States ; activities , also undertaken by private persons , provoking very severe harm to the environment of other States ; extensive terrorism resulting from organized transnational crime ; and the role of education in combating violence and organized criminality .  
The Branch has also issued in response to new legislative enactments , additional reports on the review of priority themes , in accordance with Commission resolution 1 / 1 on strategic management ; action against national and transnational economic and organized crime , and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment ; and capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty .  
The information transmitted is often designed to bring about the provisional arrest of a criminal with a view to subsequent extradition .  The organization also has an analytical crime intelligence unit working on international crime and producing reports that are extremely useful in connection with offences such as money-laundering , where transnational movements are very difficult to trace .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .  NULL  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
It further invited Governments to consider the development of standard minimum rules for the humanitarian treatment of trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards , and to support comprehensive practical approaches by the international community to assist women and children victims of transnational trafficking to return home and be reintegrated into their home societies .  
Economic and environmental questions : reports of subsidiary bodies , In decision 1996 / 305 , the Council decided to continue consideration of agenda item 6 ( i ) , including the draft resolution entitled " Corruption and bribery in transnational commercial activities " ( E / 1996 / L . 26 ) , at its resumed substantive session of 1996 , and also requested the President of the Council to continue to facilitate open-ended consultations prior to its resumed substantive session , with a view to enhancing the prospects for achieving consensus . 
In addition , the Council decided that " the Group should meet for a period of two weeks not more than once a year and should report to the Commission on Transnational Corporations on further steps to be taken in pursuit of the long-term objective of the international harmonization of accounting and reporting within the scope of the work of the Commission , particularly with regard to the comprehensive information system and the code of conduct on transnational corporations currently being formulated , on the understanding that duplication of work should be avoided " .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .  
At its fifth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted resolution 5 / 2 , entitled " Technical cooperation and interregional advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice " , in which it reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the Programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality , as well as the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
Considering the priority that African Governments are giving to achieve economic growth and sustainable development , considering also the challenge of growing criminality , both national and transnational , it is imperative that all measures that are being taken to achieve sustainable development are linked with crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money-laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .

The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

Hungary supported any substantive joint international initiatives , convinced that only a universal effort coordinated by the United Nations through its crime-prevention mechanisms could combat transnational organized crime .  
The constant growth of crime , with its dangerous new forms and transnational dimension , in many parts of the world represented a destabilizing threat to fundamental social , economic and political institutions , especially of those countries in transition , and endangered international security .  
The unprecedented globalization and diversification of organized transnational crime constituted a major threat to security , social and economic stability and the democratic development of States .  
In that context , she felt it was important that the terms " organized " and " transnational " crime should not be used to describe controversial political ideas , but restricted to agreed social and legal dimensions .  
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
Also to be considered is the expansion of United Nations efforts to achieve agreement on key issues required for a favourable environment for business , such as uniform commercial codes and intellectual property and accounting standards , and to deal with transnational problems , such as crime and corruption , which inhibit both good governance and good business .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Those topics should be related to the most urgent problems , demanding concerted action of particular importance , such as the struggle against transnational organized crime and terrorism , which had a detrimental impact on the full enjoyment of human rights and constituted a serious danger to peace and security , at both the national and international levels .  
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
In welcoming the participants , he emphasized the growing threat posed by organized transnational crime in all its insidious forms , including theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
The Government of India had recognized the threat posed by organized transnational crime and measures had been taken at both the organizational and legislative levels by streamlining and reinforcing law enforcement agencies dealing with sophisticated forms of crime , as well as by drafting and passing legislation that dealt with , inter alia , terrorism , drug trafficking , smuggling of valuables and money-laundering .  
Spain submitted a study on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime based on information collected at the national level by means of a questionnaire completed by all units of the judicial police .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Their main objectives include assistance in drafting and implementing up-to-date legislation in the field of preventing and controlling organized transnational crime and associated criminal activities ; assistance to selected government departments in meeting problems raised by the legal reform process through training and the provision of short-term expertise ; and strengthening of the criminal justice system capacity to fight organized crime , also in cooperation with international counterparts .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
In order to assist countries in need and to render more operational its technical assistance activities , the Division , as requested by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1996 / 27 , will also develop a training manual for specialized law enforcement and investigative personnel on action against organized transnational crime .  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .  
We thank the UNCTAD secretariat for having convened this Expert Meeting , as well as for the preparatory work and the documentation , all of which is contributing to a more profound analysis of trade in relation to health services - an area in which many countries , largely developing countries like Cuba , are striving to become competitive in an international market dominated to all intents and purposes by the large transnational corporations . 
An indigenous participant from Northern Europe made a statement on behalf of several organizations about the drafting of some preliminary global guidelines on the working policies , practices and directives of transnational corporations operating in indigenous areas .  The guidelines included several aspects : prior informed consent and consultation with indigenous peoples ;  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
Recognizes that business and industry , including transnational corporations , play a crucial role in the social and economic development of a country , that a stable policy regime enables and encourages business and industry to operate responsibly and efficiently and to implement longer-term policies and that the activities of business and industry are the primary contributors to increasing prosperity , which is a major goal of the development process ;  
This approach illustrates that the United Nations is treated ultimately by Governments as a creature of national self-interest where national sovereignty is supreme , however and by whomever that is defined , and not equipped with conditions to reflect universal rights and growing transnational concerns .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
If we are to be occupied , and not only preoccupied , with reform , let us reject , as incompatible with this Organization , the corporate and transnational approach promoted by some of the main United Nations contributors , as if this building were a stock exchange and the just desires of the peoples were mere merchandise .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
Also , as the Secretary-General has noted elsewhere , the transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting the fulfilment of even national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
Insufficient cooperation among law enforcement agencies , lack of appropriate controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle , corruption , legislative discrepancies with regard to bona fide possession of a motor vehicle in various regions of the world , a variety of registration practices and differences in the level of training of vehicle inspectors are generally indicated as factors facilitating the involvement of organized transnational crime in this profitable form of illicit trafficking .  
Algeria stated that , in the light of the need to provide States with effective instruments for international cooperation in the fight against organized transnational crime , it supported the spirit and principles embodied in the draft framework convention and hoped that such a convention could soon be adopted .  
Austria continued to be sceptical about the feasibility of elaborating a useful convention against organized transnational crime , as organized crime was a complex phenomenon that raised a number of legal issues that were not adequately covered in the draft .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Finally , Canada expressed the view that the ratification and implementation of existing international instruments represented a first step towards creating a comprehensive and successful legal framework for international cooperation against organized transnational crime .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
They shall promote the harmonization of their countries ' national legislation on combating organized transnational crime and terrorism , including illegal trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors , explosives and other hazardous materials , hijacking of motor transport , counterfeiting , money-laundering , crime in the area of foreign economic and banking transactions and taxation , and illegal migration and illegal crossing of borders .  
We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
We express our strong hope to participate in the work of the inter-sessional open-ended intergovernmental group of experts of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice1 charged with elaborating a preliminary draft of an international convention against organized transnational crime , so as to fully support the efforts of the Commission in elaborating such a convention , and we call upon the Commission to pursue those efforts as a matter of the utmost urgency .  
We call upon donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank , the African Development Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to give favourable consideration to project proposals on strengthening our national or regional capacities and creating the expertise required for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime and corruption , elaborated by the Division and submitted to them .  
We regard the project proposals that we have reviewed ( reflected in annex III of the report of the Regional Ministerial Workshop ) as viable and important regional initiatives , containing the basic elements of a concerted approach to the problems faced by all States of the region in the prevention and control of organized transnational crime , money-laundering and corruption .  
In his opening address , the Prime Minister of Senegal expressed the hope that the Regional Ministerial Workshop would focus on strengthening international cooperation in technical and substantive fields , in order to improve the professional skills of criminal justice personnel and thereby enable them to achieve greater success in the fight against organized transnational crime and corruption .  
The States participating in the Regional Ministerial Workshop decided that the early formulation of national positions was essential to ensure that their specific concerns would be appropriately reflected in the text of an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
It must be recognized that at a time when economies and societies were becoming increasingly interdependent , as stated by the Secretary-General in the 1997 report on the world social situation , transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting fulfilment of even the national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives ( E / 1997 / 15 , p .  2 ) .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .  
We also support the proposal to elaborate a comprehensive international legal instrument against transnational organized crime , which plays a central role in promoting illegal drug use and its attendant activities .  
It was emphasized by one speaker that poverty , unemployment , social injustice and unfair and imbalanced trade and economic relations should be considered factors that rendered States vulnerable to organized transnational crimes .  
The Commission expressed its concern about the growth of transnational organized crime , which was affecting the political stability and social and cultural values of societies all over the world , threatening national and global security .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
He expressed the Communitys concern at the growth of transnational organized crime whose many facets and increasing sophistication threatened not only national and global security but also political stability and social and cultural values the world over .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
It is understood that transnational organized crime exists when three or more persons agree to organize or are organized , on a permanent or recurrent basis , to commit acts that in themselves or when combined with others have as an objective or result the commission of a crime or crimes that are identified in article 2 and over which two or more States Parties have established their jurisdiction , in accordance with article 9 of this Convention .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .  
With the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance , those instruments provide a foundation for promoting and maintaining the rule of law , a basic requisite for sustainable socio-economic development ; furnish a basis for Governments to assess their systems , formulate legislation and develop effective tools for controlling national and transnational forms of crime ; and provide a framework for technical assistance , which in turn serves as a catalyst for their implementation .  
From Argentina to Ghana , State intervention in the economy has been drastically curtailed , protectionist barriers to Northern imports have been eliminated wholesale , restrictions on foreign investment have been lifted and , through export-first policies , internal economies have been more tightly integrated into the capitalist world market dominated by transnational corporations .  
Slovakia supported the establishment of an international fund for victims of crime and abuse of power , provided that the conditions that entitled a victim of international or transnational crime to redress by the international fund were restricted to incidents where national compensation and redress were unavailable or insufficient .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
$ 253,600 for general temporary assistance required for the temporary replacement of staff on extended sick leave or maternity leave ; temporary assistance during periods of peak workload due mainly to finalization of the convention against transnational organized crime and three additional international legal instruments ; and temporary assistance for the preparation and servicing of the sessions of the Commission ;  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , statistics , findings and results of action-oriented research , including high-quality analysis of and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and in corruption ;  
Specifically , Member States will have received timely and effective assistance upon request to deal with new crime challenges , especially transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings , economic and financial crimes and corruption .

An important and recent concern has been the impact of transnational informational technology and mass media on peoples perceptions and expectations , in terms of their leading to or aggravating a conflict between expectations and realities , and between values and social roles , induced by the contrast between the cultures of rich countries and the pattern of opportunity in less well off societies .  
At its thirty-sixth session , in 1998 , the Commission for Social Development considered that while the primary responsibility for crime prevention and criminal justice rests at the national level , violence , crime and illicit drugs activities are of such magnitude and also have such major transnational dimensions that they require international cooperation and coordination in respect of formulating and implementing effective responses .

Broad agreement was reached on the mechanisms for cooperation in the areas stipulated in the Declaration , including regular trilateral contacts among the heads of the foreign policy and other interested departments , and joint consultations at various levels , in particular with a view to counteracting the spread of aggressive religious and other extremism and combating terrorism , transnational organized crime and illicit traffic in drugs and arms .  
What links many of these seemingly disparate issues is an often inchoate , but nevertheless palpable , fear on the part of large numbers of thoughtful people , in developing , and developed countries alike , that impersonal forces beyond their control and accountable to no one - distant bureaucracies , mammoth transnational corporations , international organizations meeting behind closed doors - are taking over their lives .  
UNCTAD 's future work should aim at improving developing countries understanding of the impact of foreign direct investment , through transnational corporations , on international trade , technology flows , enterprise development and their development prospects generally .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
To obtain the pertinent information , the Centre is currently finalizing a transnational organized crime assessment survey , which will be used to develop descriptive narratives based on both quantitative and qualitative information on the characteristics of the top 10 organized crime groups based in 12 selected countries and one region .

Governments , vulnerable to the threats of withdrawal from transnational companies and to political pressure from voters who were not prepared to change their lifestyles , had difficulty in maintaining social standards and affording the initial cost of moving to environmentally friendly technologies and behaviours .  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries .

The entry of transnational criminal operators in the financial world is believed to herald potential disruption , distortion of rules , erosion of ethics and suppression of competition ; ultimately , it is assumed to foster a purge among entrepreneurs , leading to the survival of those more criminally fit . 
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups .

Taking place on the threshold of a new millennium , the Congress will serve as an unprecedented global forum to exchange and enhance innovative ideas from various relevant disciplines , demonstrate practical solutions and formulate common strategies to fight emerging crime issues , especially transnational crime .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .

The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .  
The Italian Government is convinced that bilateral or regional agreements are not enough to meet the need for prompt collaboration in investigating and prosecuting transnational crimes committed by organized crime groups .

Participants also recognized the valuable work performed by the Centre in implementing the global programmes against corruption , trafficking in human beings and transnational organized crime at the regional and national levels .  
The fast pace of globalization , the competition for FDI and the sheer size of many transnational corporations ( TNCs ) can make it difficult for a host country acting alone to set in place adequate environmental controls over incoming FDI .  
Although there is a wide scientific debate and considerable media speculation about organized crime , there is little empirical research on the extent , structure , nature and strategies adopted by transnational organized criminal groups at the global level .

Participants also recognized the valuable work performed by the Centre in implementing the global programmes against corruption , trafficking in human beings and transnational organized crime at the regional and national levels .  
Deeply concerned by the growing impact of the activities of transnational organized crime on societies , and convinced of the urgent need to strengthen cooperation to combat such activities at the national , regional and international levels , .  
The growth of transnational organized crime is affecting the political stability and social and cultural values of societies all over the world , threatening national and global security .  
However , the special nature and complexity of transnational organized crime demands that the collective legal thinking of States should be challenged to find ways to prevent such differences from impeding effective action .  
All States participating in the negotiations expressed their determination to deny safe havens to those who engaged in transnational organized crime by prosecuting their crimes wherever they occurred and by cooperating at the international level .  
To develop a legally binding framework for regulating the actions of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) , respecting the international labour , human rights , and sustainable environmental standards set by the United Nations and its relevant specialized agencies .  
The deplorable action of transnational corporations which , as a result of neoliberal globalization , monopolize principal international markets , imposing their prices while remaining practically exempt from paying any form of tax ;

But its main task was to promote technical cooperation and implement integrated programmes , always bearing in mind the current technological revolution and the profound changes taking place in industrial organizations , especially transnational corporations .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .  
These efforts will be pursued in an integrated manner , supported by the three global programmes against transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings and corruption , and in close coordination with the global programme against money laundering of the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention .  
Objective : To strengthen international cooperation and assistance to Governments in tackling crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems .  
By 2005 , most Member States that have not already done so will have developed , adopted and implemented the necessary domestic legal and administrative measures , which will create an infrastructure for preventing and controlling illicit transnational traffic in firearms and related items .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
International and regional forums will be established and expanded to bring together legal and technical experts in computer and telecommunications issues , from both the public and private sectors , to develop materials in support of the fight against transnational computer-related crime .  
Draws the attention of all States to the provisions of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , 2 signed at the High-level Political Signing Conference held in Palermo , Italy , from 12 to 15 December 2000 , and of the protocols thereto , 3 , 4 which strengthen the countermeasures against transnational organized crime by , inter alia , providing a concrete basis for international cooperation and for effective law enforcement action to deal in an integrated manner with all interrelated aspects of illicit trafficking ;  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Aware of the increasing rate of illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,

Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Greater awareness is also needed of global negatives illicit drugs , transnational crime , tobacco and of ways in which globalization is fostering them , leading to a more effective integration of the policy and regulatory framework required to address them into the overall actions being promoted to spread and maximize the potential benefits of globalization .  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
At its forty-seventh session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1995 / 31 , endorsed the background document of the Secretary-General ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1995 / 11 ) and requested the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the impact of the activities and working methods of transnational corporations on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , bearing in mind existing international guidelines , rules and standards relating to the subject matter .  
We affirm that slavery , particularly of Africans and their descendants , and especially the transatlantic slave trade , was a unique and appalling tragedy in the history of humanity and a crime against humanity , not only because of its abhorrent barbarism , but also in terms of its enormous magnitude , its institutionalized nature , its transnational dimension and especially its negation of the very essence of the human nature of its victims ;  
Urges States and financial and development institutions to mitigate the negative effects of globalization by examining how their policies and practices affect indigenous peoples ; by ensuring that their policies and practices contribute to the eradication of racism through the participation of indigenous peoples in development projects in accordance with the principle of informed consent ; by democratizing international financial institutions ; by developing enforceable codes of conduct for transnational corporations ; and by consulting with indigenous peoples in any matter that may affect their physical , spiritual or cultural integrity ;  
He further requested that the Working Group pay attention to and report on the emerging standards based on precedent and existing legal instruments by which indigenous peoples and nations were seeking justice and reparations for the past and present abuses of mining and other corporations , including in the home countries of transnational corporations .  
The Ministers recalled that the illicit trade in small arms in the region is mainly associated with drug trafficking , terrorism , transnational organized crime , mercenary activities and other criminal acts , and held that crime prevention must therefore be an integral part of the approach to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . 
New and more dangerous phenomena have emerged that affect the security of States and their citizens , such as international terrorism , drug trafficking , transnational organized crime , the illegal exploitation of natural resources and other factors that threaten the regional and international security balance of our contemporary world .  
Success in the fight against transnational organized crime depended largely on the ability of States to achieve equitable growth , integrate themselves into the global economy in a manner consistent with their economic and social policy objectives and ensure that their populations benefited equitably from new opportunities for empowerment and technological advancement .  
The expansion of global knowledge of and expertise to deal with crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money-laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems ;  
For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
By relying on their superiority in technology and capital and with transnational corporations as a tool , Western developed countries have been pursuing an unfair distribution of resources worldwide in the course of economic globalization , thus continuing the widening the gap between the North and the South . The gap between the rich and the poor in the world today is unprecedentedly wide .  
And the scientific and technological elements in these direct investments of foreign businessmen have increased , more transnational corporations have come to invest in China , and the scale of independent investments has expanded .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
In discussions of the question of joining the WTO , the thing some economists and local officials are most concerned about is that the massive influx of transnational companies will be a shock to the service , manufacturing , and agricultural industries in China , and they also express deep worries over native industries .  
In the " Alma Ata Declaration " , leaders of the five countries explicitly expressed their common position of opposing the national separatist force and the religious extremist forces , jointly cracking down on international terrorists , organized crimes , drug-trafficking , smuggling , and other transnational criminal activities .  They all agreed that they would not allow any people to use their own territories to carry out activities detrimental to the state sovereignty , security , and social order of another country .  
The Summit attendees unanimously proposed " zero tolerance of separatism , ethnic separatism and religious extremism , " and wrote the proposal that " each member state should adopt measures to combat the international terrorism , organized crimes , arm smuggling , drug trafficking and other transnational criminal activities " in the first joint charter .  It centered the " Shanghai Five " cooperation on the experiment of establishing an effective security cooperation framework instead of its initial goal of accomplishing border military trust and disarmament .  
Taking advantage of the complex social factors and the transnational geological condition in the Feiergan valley , international terrorist forces repeatedly carried out terrorist activities in Kyrgyzstan and south Uzbekistan in 1999 and 2000 .  In addition , due to the various political effects from both inside and outside the region , relevant countries and the whole Eurasian area face unprecedented threats to stability .  
He said , overseas Chinese and ethnic Chinese living abroad have transnational culture , and there are also many specialized talented people among them ; there are more than 100,000 highly talented Chinese in science and technology and various specialities in North America ; this is advantageous for the United States in opening up the China market , for China 's economic construction , and for ethnic Chinese and overseas Chinese to develop their business .  
From the international aspect , economic globalization is speeding up , the new science and technology revolution is rapidly developing , the influence of transnational companies in global economy is increasing , the capital competition between states is growing every fiercer , and profound changes are now taking place in the world political and economic pattern .  
In the field of regional issues , the two sides emphasized the adoption of active and effective measures to crack down on national splittist , international terrorist , religious extremist , and transnational criminal activities .  
Increasingly , Xinjiang 's ethnic separatist forces abroad have tended to join forces in launching attacks , replacing scattered operations with regional operations , and even with transregional , transnational , multi-level , and joint operations , and such an initial tendency may be viewed at the following three levels : 
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
Besides , regional conflicts triggered by racial , religious , and territorial problems have never cease to break out , rising one after another ; many transnational problems , such as international crime and environmental deterioration , are far from being solved ; and the international community is still faced with many challenges .  
Second , continuous efforts should be made to crack down on religious extremist forces , ethnic secessionist forces , international terrorism and other transnational crimes that endanger regional stability and security .  
The proposal stressed : The four countries in the region will conduct multilateral scientific , technological , and economic cooperation in animal husbandry , planting , ecologically non-destructive mining industry , and transnational tourist industry .  They will strive to gain the support of the international community for the region , and import capital , qualified personnel , and technologies for the development of the region .  
Over the past two years , China has paid attention to attracting transnational companies to invest in China and focus the use of foreign capital on infrastructure facilities , basic industries , research and development , and technical innovation .  Meanwhile , we have worked out a host of preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to invest in the central and western regions , with a view to restructuring the industries and regions that use foreign capital .  
He said : Further efforts to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries and their militaries in all fields , and joint efforts to strike at ethnic splittism that seriously threaten the stability of relevant nations and regional security , international terrorism , religious extremist forces , and transnational criminal activities , conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples , and are of great significance to safeguarding peace , stability , and development in this region .  
Both foreign ministers also exchanged opinions on increasing bilateral cooperation in the fields of information technology industry , environmental protection , developing China 's western region , and cracking down on transnational organizational crimes .  They reached consensus of opinion extensively .  
In response to some important issues with common interests in both the Asian side and the European side , the Chinese Government proposed the holding an Asia-Europe environmental ministerial meeting , carrying out scientific and technological cooperation in Asian and European forest protection and sustainable development , and holding a seminar of Asian and European law enforcement institutions on cracking down on transnational crimes .  These proposals also won support from various Asian and European countries .  
In the sphere of political cooperation , the priority tasks to be carried out are the increase of political dialogues between the senior officials of various countries , the acceleration of the United Nations ' reforms , the promotion of the common interest of international organizations , and some global issues of common concern ( such as the restrictions on the proliferation of large-sized weapons , the solution of worldwide environmental protection , the crackdown on transnational crime , money laundering , and international terrorism , and others ) .  
The three proposals made by Zhu Rongji at the meeting regarding the further expansion of Asia-Europe cooperation in economic , trade , scientific and technological , and other spheres , the joint efforts to crack down on transnational crime and corruption , and the strengthening of cooperation in environmental protection and sustainable development were unanimously approved by the leaders of various countries and written into the document of the " Asia-Europe Cooperation Framework 2000 . "  
Zhu Rongji pointed out : The problems such as illegal immigration , sneaky intrusion into other countries , and so on exist in many countries , which is the transnational crime committed by international criminal groups and must be cracked down on with joint efforts .  
While the international community is facing daily increase in global problems , it is necessary for all countries , including China and France , to make concerted efforts and strengthen cooperation in protecting the environment and combating drug trafficking , illegal immigration and transnational organized crimes .  
On the other hand , aiming at the goal of ultimately becoming an extraordinarily large high-tech transnational group with fairly strong competitiveness , actively develop external economic relations and carry out business expansion on the international scene and export of technologies and labor service to make the contributions expected of us in enabling China 's aerospace [ industry ] to rank among the first in the world .  
Jeffrey Koo said : Advanced countries do not have many restrictions regarding sending back the investment made by transnational companies .  A long time ago when Taiwan did not have an ample foreign exchange reserve , it set a requirement , setting a yearly limit for Taiwan businessmen to remit money to foreign countries .  According to China 's current financial system , it is difficult for Taiwan businessmen to remit their profits back to Taiwan .  
the WTO requires various member countries , whether large or small , to implement the principle of nondiscriminating trade treatment ; a legal system and good market order are a regular way to attract international investment , especially investment from transnational corporations , and the practice of relying on preferential policies and special regional treatment to attracting foreign investment will be no longer effective ;  
The meeting just concluded was a great success .  It provided WCO Member administrations in the region with a valuable opportunity to share their views on a wide range of Customs subjects , including , the application of international instrument for trade facilitation , strengthening of enforcement capability in combating transnational crimes such as Amphetamine Type Stimulants ( ATS ) and internet piracy , promotion of multilateral co-operation for mutual administrative assistance and out-reaching with the business sector for partnership .  
On Police commitment in tackling crimes attributable to triad activities , Mr Tsang said a total of 2 472 persons were arrested for a variety of triad related offences .  " At the same time , Police devoted great efforts in fighting cross-border organised crimes .  Hong Kong Police will in March 2002 host an international conference on transnational organised crime which will be attended by prominent members of law enforcement agencies from across the Globe .  
Market Expansion : Money is rolling in at these companies that match people up , the credit for which really belongs to those far-sighted entrepreneurs who broadened the " market . " Besides serving the young unmarried men and women of Taiwan , there are now introductions for friendship and marriage across the Taiwan Straits , as well as transnational special columns for Chinese abroad ; the age levels have been broadened to include the " second spring " of divorced or widowed persons , as well as " September romances " for the silver haired set .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
Local enterprises are still not very enthused about international strategic alliances , and they do n't understand them very well , " says Huang Hsiao - kuan , executive director of the business alliance group . Most American strategic alliances are games between large corporations , and transnational matchups require that " both families are of comparable standing . " Not only do both sides have to have suitable manpower , technology , and capital to be mutually attractive , they need comparable international perspectives and internationalization experience before they can really communicate .  
The opium that undermined China more than a century ago arrived through transnational trade , and the same thing is true of modern narcotics . In advanced countries drug production is strictly controlled , and it is virtually impossible to cultivate poppies ( for opium or heroin ) , coca ( for cocaine ) , or cannabis on a huge scale . Given the high demand for narcotics in these societies , the result is that supplies are inadequate , naturally forcing prices up .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
A : Our company is a transnational group , so as long as a year and a half ago we started thinking about what kind of new corporate culture we should develop to be able to maintain our leading position in the 21st century . Eventually we established four key elements for our future success .  
Government policies , the special features of multinational capital , and the political , economic , social , and cultural features of the host country are all important factors in the development of transnational economic cooperation . "  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
He says that at present , unclear policies and sporadic services result in serious problems such foreign wives failing to adjust well to their surroundings , domestic violence , children doing poorly in school , and bogus marriages that are actually a cover for prostitution . According to Lin , the government urgently needs to address the growing social problems and costs arising from transnational marriages .  
China 's market has great potential and faces fierce competition , while Switzerland has many powerful transnational corporations and a large number of small and medium sized companies with unique and professional technology Therefore , the prospects for further development of bilateral trade and economic cooperation are promising  
The expansion of transnational corporation activities world wide calls for adequate governmental response , which , in the successful pursuit of national policies in an interdependent world , requires a global view .  
Another major obstacle is the broad range of activities in which transnational crime is involved , which are not always covered or sanctioned by existing criminal legislation .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
Globalization , an all-inclusive term conceived in the interests of the major transnational corporations , is now devouring national entities , sovereignty and independence beyond any limit or reason , bringing in its wake a global invasion of destitution , population growth , mass migration and environmental degradation , which can not be avoided by even the most powerful of this world .  
While the principle of the severity of the offence is sound in view of the need to address the multitude of activities engaged in by organized transnational criminal groups , further elaboration is needed in the light of the differing national perceptions of the severity of individual offences .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
Seminars and workshops on the functions and impact of international , regional and bilateral arrangements ; country experience studies ; harmonization of foreign direct investment reporting systems ; incorporation of sustainable development management practices into national policies ; and enhancement of national strategies for sustainable development as they relate to transnational corporations .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
They included " Action against national and transnational economic and organized crime and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment : national experiences and international cooperation " , which was considered in a plenary session , with a special session on corruption .  
They call for the development of an empirical base of knowledge on the nature , dynamics and operations of new sophisticated and diversified forms of transnational organized , economic and environmental crime that pose a particular threat , and on their linkages with terrorist violence , corruption and money-laundering .  
The 142 States present at the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Crime proclaimed their political will and strong determination , as well as their unequivocal commitment , to ensure the full and expeditious implementation of the Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , reflecting the urgency and priority attention attached to action against organized transnational crime .  
To implement their commitments in the fight against transnational organized crime , they established a group of senior experts , with a temporary mandate to look at existing arrangements for cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , to identify significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
While peer pressure in the context of an institutional framework is invaluable , the risk of misperceptions as to ultimate objectives and the ways to achieve them may be too great in view of the implications of organized transnational crime and the threat it poses to developed and developing countries alike .  
The threat posed to the internal security and stability of sovereign States , as well as to international security , by the dramatic increase of organized transnational crime in the past decade is growing and will continue to grow and become more menacing if concerted and decisive action on the part of the international community is delayed .  
While energies have to be focused and action planned in the best and most efficient manner , the ultimate goals of effectively preventing and controlling organized transnational crime in all its forms and dimensions , and arresting its expansion at both the national and international levels , should be guiding the relevant efforts and should constitute the yardstick against which success is to be assessed .  
In addition to examining the opportunity and impact of international instruments such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , and an indication of the issues and elements to be covered therein , priority attention was given to improving reliable knowledge on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime , legislative and regulatory measures , and technical cooperation .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
Academic institutions and professional associations have a major role to play in accumulating theoretical knowledge on organized transnational crime and in disseminating this knowledge , in close cooperation with governmental agencies and the education system , as well as in concert with the media , non-governmental organizations and the private sector .  
Developed countries are generally in a position to devote the necessary resources for acquiring the body of both theoretical and practical knowledge that is required for the effective prevention and control of organized transnational crime and , as discussed earlier , considerable efforts in that direction are in progress .  
Provision of the information and materials requested by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 11 would permit the undertaking of a comprehensive and comparative study of the situation in the various regions of the world , thus contributing to the achievement of the goal of improving reliable knowledge on organized transnational crime , its structure and dynamics .  
Through a global assessment of the transnational organized crime situation , the study would seek to contribute to a better understanding of the problems arising from differences that exist or emerge among various countries in the perception and evaluation of organized transnational crime , thus leading to the gradual development of a common perception of the phenomenon , and a global strategy for more effective international cooperation .  
The results of the study would also be used for the development of special programmes , courses and curriculums for academic institutions , to ensure that theoretical knowledge is increased , improved and disseminated , and to create the basis for long-term and consistent action against organized transnational crime .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States expressed the wish to strengthen and enhance the capability of States , as well as the United Nations and other relevant global and regional organizations , to achieve more effective international cooperation against organized transnational crime , in relation , inter alia , to closer alignment of legislative texts concerning organized crime .  
The realization at the political and decision-making level of the actual magnitude and complexity of organized transnational crime may serve as a basis for elaborating improved forms of international cooperation , drawing on the pool of knowledge and experience in the scientific community .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
" Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
The field of basic industries requires massive capital outlay and larger markets beyond the capacity of individual African countries and can therefore be optimally established through subregional and regional cooperation arrangements of multinational / transnational industrial enterprises .  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
As we approach the next millennium and as the pre-eminence of transnational forces has blurred the definition of national sovereignty , we must seriously question why a powerful minority is still allowed to bankrupt and coerce the majority to meet its narrow economic and political needs .  
My delegation , while welcoming the decisions of the Group of Seven and Russia on combatting terrorism and transnational threats , believes that a more complete use of the potential of the United Nations as an instrument for developing joint international strategies and cooperation among all States in the area of fighting crime would allow for more effective coordination of the actions of the international community .  
The uncharted waters ahead remain daunting , defined by bilious seas of unrelenting , sophisticated , transnational criminal activity , which is tearing at the very fabric of society .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance . 
The international community is faced with the growing threat arising from seemingly unstoppable manifestations of transnational organized crime and international terrorism , which menace both the material and institutional foundations of our societies .  
Poland believes , therefore , that the time has come to make a concerted international effort to agree on , and accede to a comprehensive legal instrument : a convention designed to enhance cooperation between States and facilitate the work of law enforcement agencies in fighting transnational organized crime .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Deeply concerned about the rising levels of crime in many parts of the world , particularly transnational organized crime and its negative effects on socio-economic development , political stability and the internal and external security of States , as well as on the well-being of people ,  
Reaffirms the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality and to assist Member States in achieving the goals of preventing crime within and among States and improving the response to crime , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46 / 152 and in line with the recommendations of the Ninth Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders ;  
The principles considered were not limited to traditional relations of public international law but were in fact also relevant to private international law ( conflict of laws with regard to transnational relations between individuals and various kinds of organizations , whether incorporated or not ) and international administrative law ( with regard to relations between individuals or organizations and public authorities ) .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime .  
Should the Commission be satisfied with the nature and amount of information presented thus far , and bearing in mind the legislative and policy pronouncements made by the General Assembly and the Council and its subsidiary bodies , it might wish to specify practical measures for an international course of action to guide States in combating an increasingly acute criminological phenomenon of transnational dimension .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
In this field , the Division and UNDCP are currently finalizing a joint project proposal for a global project on money-laundering , aiming at the development of the basic legal and institutional framework for more efficient response to transnational organized crime and illicit money traffic .  
Ministers and other delegates reported on what they had learned about methods of dealing with organized transnational crime , and formulated a declaration on the subject that was to be implemented in part by two region-wide technical cooperation projects .  
56 In view of the renewed discussion of the problem of transnational organized crime at the summit of the seven major industrialized countries ( Group of Seven ) , held at Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada , the Division would be ready to cooperate with the established group of senior experts in identifying significant gaps and options for improved coordination and to propose practical action to fill such gaps .  
One successor State reported that it adhered to all international treaties , and made proposals to the police of other countries to sign new bilateral agreements , particularly on cooperation in combating all types of transnational crime , such as organized crime , drug trafficking and economic and financial crime .  
Deregulation processes , new technologies , advancements in telecommunications and the creation of expanded economic spaces and market liberalization have had major implications on the development process , and have induced sizable productivity increases and new opportunities for profits , not only for the legal economy , but also , for organized transnational crime , which coexisted with , and benefited by , the legal economy .  
Regulators , money-laundering investigators and international policy-making bodies are facing profound challenges from a banking world which not only knows no geographic horizons and is open 24 hours a day , but is increasingly interconnected , as large transnational banks extend their reach not only through branch and subsidiary networks , but through correspondent relationships that cross the globe .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to submit to Member States for their consideration at the fifth session of the Commission a proposal on the creation of a central repository for existing legislative and regulatory measures and information on organizational structures designed to combat organized transnational crime , taking into account the capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network .  
Part of the problem for the international community in trying to deal with organized transnational crime is that there is no single organizational or behavioural paradigm that provides a constant and accessible target .  
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
38 Discussions about action against organized transnational crime often assume , sometimes implicitly , that if only Governments devoted more efforts and resources at the national level and increased cooperation at the bilateral level , they could make considerable inroads against organized transnational crime .  
National successes , such as the arrest of the leaders of the Cali cartel , and the priority attention given to action against organized transnational crime by world leaders on numerous occasions , including during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , as well as the increasing willingness of the international community to place corruption under public scrutiny , are all encouraging developments .  
47 The central theme in all the information provided by States on this subject is the need to further enhance international cooperation which , if integrated with national efforts , will form a comprehensive strategy against organized transnational crime .  
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
Argentina hopes that the members of the international community will deploy the necessary efforts and resources to make it possible , within a reasonable time , to embody in a general convention the political commitments of countries to combat this form of crime and to ensure mutual cooperation to that end .  The conclusion of a general convention would afford the international community a single , efficient and effective instrument for responding suitably to the activities and manifestations of organized transnational crime .  
Since the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan have made a strong statement on behalf of the world community and have already drawn attention to this pressing issue , the focus should be on implementation and development of other practical measures and instruments to combat organized transnational crime .  NULLIn the view of Cuba , in order to combat organized transnational crime it is not enough to merely establish or even ratify various regional or international instruments .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
Italy is of the opinion that the effectiveness of the implementation of the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan will be maximized if , while advancing the process of elaborating a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime , a group of highly qualified national experts develop specific recommendations , which could be immediately implemented at the national level .  
However , in the absence of a general framework or model for international cooperation against organized transnational crime and in view of the diversity of legal systems , as well as the variety of the legislative agenda of countries , while desirable , it might not be appropriate and effective at present to effect world cooperation through such an international convention .  
Meeting the challenge requires the allocation of commensurate resources by the international community and the maintenance of a strong collective political will , keeping in mind that no State can afford to be complacent in responding to organized transnational crime .  
The Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , complemented by the action already taken by the Commission at its fourth session , have set in motion a process of increased awareness of the threat posed by organized transnational crime and of the need for urgent action at the national and international levels .  
Such a programme might include comparative studies of the situation of organized transnational crime around the world and the establishment and maintenance of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime , and bilateral and multilateral cooperation arrangements .  
38 The Holy See suggested that the Congress should focus on the development of new international legal instruments and forms of international jurisdiction to combat transnational crime linked to : speculative financial transactions severely harming the economy of one or more States ; activities , also undertaken by private persons , provoking very severe harm to the environment of other States ; extensive terrorism resulting from organized transnational crime ; and the role of education in combating violence and organized criminality .  
The Branch has also issued in response to new legislative enactments , additional reports on the review of priority themes , in accordance with Commission resolution 1 / 1 on strategic management ; action against national and transnational economic and organized crime , and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment ; and capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty .  
The information transmitted is often designed to bring about the provisional arrest of a criminal with a view to subsequent extradition .  The organization also has an analytical crime intelligence unit working on international crime and producing reports that are extremely useful in connection with offences such as money-laundering , where transnational movements are very difficult to trace .  
Contacts , coordination and cooperation among these bodies should be encouraged .  In particular , it is of fundamental importance that all existing technical , bilateral and multilateral activities involving technical cooperation be well focused and that the means for coordinating such activities be studied in order to avoid overlapping " ( item 6 of the provisional agenda , entitled " Most effective forms of international cooperation for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime at the investigative , prosecutorial and judicial levels " ) ( E / CONF . 88 / 4 , para .  NULL  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
In the light of growing crime worldwide , the opening of the discussion during the coming session of the General Assembly on the elaboration of the convention would contribute greatly to the global struggle against the highly dangerous phenomenon of organized transnational crime and by the same token would permit Member States to concentrate their efforts on the conclusion of this important international instrument .  
It further invited Governments to consider the development of standard minimum rules for the humanitarian treatment of trafficked persons , consistent with human rights standards , and to support comprehensive practical approaches by the international community to assist women and children victims of transnational trafficking to return home and be reintegrated into their home societies .  
Economic and environmental questions : reports of subsidiary bodies , In decision 1996 / 305 , the Council decided to continue consideration of agenda item 6 ( i ) , including the draft resolution entitled " Corruption and bribery in transnational commercial activities " ( E / 1996 / L . 26 ) , at its resumed substantive session of 1996 , and also requested the President of the Council to continue to facilitate open-ended consultations prior to its resumed substantive session , with a view to enhancing the prospects for achieving consensus . 
In addition , the Council decided that " the Group should meet for a period of two weeks not more than once a year and should report to the Commission on Transnational Corporations on further steps to be taken in pursuit of the long-term objective of the international harmonization of accounting and reporting within the scope of the work of the Commission , particularly with regard to the comprehensive information system and the code of conduct on transnational corporations currently being formulated , on the understanding that duplication of work should be avoided " .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
The Secretary-General submitted to the Commission a report that provided an overview of the differences and similarities between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes , as well as a summary of the responses received from States . 8 / The report concluded that , while the links between transnational organized crime and terrorist crimes are usually more circumstantial than institutional , both forms of crime present formidable challenges to the international community and require improved international cooperation .  
At its fifth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted resolution 5 / 2 , entitled " Technical cooperation and interregional advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice " , in which it reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the Programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality , as well as the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
Considering the priority that African Governments are giving to achieve economic growth and sustainable development , considering also the challenge of growing criminality , both national and transnational , it is imperative that all measures that are being taken to achieve sustainable development are linked with crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money-laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .

The representative of the European Commission said that it was likely that the number of transborder RBPs ( particularly cartels , abuses of dominance and mergers having international effects ) had increased in proportion with the considerable growth in international trade , in foreign direct investment , and in the size and number of transnational corporations .  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,

Hungary supported any substantive joint international initiatives , convinced that only a universal effort coordinated by the United Nations through its crime-prevention mechanisms could combat transnational organized crime .  
The constant growth of crime , with its dangerous new forms and transnational dimension , in many parts of the world represented a destabilizing threat to fundamental social , economic and political institutions , especially of those countries in transition , and endangered international security .  
The unprecedented globalization and diversification of organized transnational crime constituted a major threat to security , social and economic stability and the democratic development of States .  
In that context , she felt it was important that the terms " organized " and " transnational " crime should not be used to describe controversial political ideas , but restricted to agreed social and legal dimensions .  
A development agent and a positive factor for social integration within and among States , the private business sector - especially transnational business - must be recognized as an integral player in international organization and more closely involved in international decision-making .  
Also to be considered is the expansion of United Nations efforts to achieve agreement on key issues required for a favourable environment for business , such as uniform commercial codes and intellectual property and accounting standards , and to deal with transnational problems , such as crime and corruption , which inhibit both good governance and good business .  
However , objective reasons relating to shortage of time and staff made it impossible , at this stage , to produce a list of the countries and transnational corporations engaged in the illicit dumping of toxic and harmful products and wastes in the developing countries , particularly as the communications that were examined seemed to refer to only a very small proportion of the transboundary flow of toxic wastes and dangerous products . 
Those topics should be related to the most urgent problems , demanding concerted action of particular importance , such as the struggle against transnational organized crime and terrorism , which had a detrimental impact on the full enjoyment of human rights and constituted a serious danger to peace and security , at both the national and international levels .  
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
In welcoming the participants , he emphasized the growing threat posed by organized transnational crime in all its insidious forms , including theft of and illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
The Government of India had recognized the threat posed by organized transnational crime and measures had been taken at both the organizational and legislative levels by streamlining and reinforcing law enforcement agencies dealing with sophisticated forms of crime , as well as by drafting and passing legislation that dealt with , inter alia , terrorism , drug trafficking , smuggling of valuables and money-laundering .  
Spain submitted a study on the structure and dynamics of organized transnational crime based on information collected at the national level by means of a questionnaire completed by all units of the judicial police .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
The United States was active on the international scene both at the bilateral level , where it carried out joint operations and cooperated with many countries of different regions , and at the multilateral level , through supporting the work of the United Nations in preventing and controlling crime , as well as through the cooperation with its partners of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries plus the Russian Federation ( G-7 / P-8 ) to coordinate efforts against transnational organized crime .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
At the international level , the participants felt that the United Nations and other relevant international organizations should strengthen the provision of technical assistance and advisory services to the countries of the region , and called for the acceleration of the process of developing an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Their main objectives include assistance in drafting and implementing up-to-date legislation in the field of preventing and controlling organized transnational crime and associated criminal activities ; assistance to selected government departments in meeting problems raised by the legal reform process through training and the provision of short-term expertise ; and strengthening of the criminal justice system capacity to fight organized crime , also in cooperation with international counterparts .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , proposed the establishment of a central repository for information on legislation , regulatory measures , organizational structures designed to prevent and control organized transnational crime and bilateral and multilateral cooperation agreements .  
In order to assist countries in need and to render more operational its technical assistance activities , the Division , as requested by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1996 / 27 , will also develop a training manual for specialized law enforcement and investigative personnel on action against organized transnational crime .  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
The structure of a work programme on organized transnational crime should consist of three main elements : reliable knowledge for informed decision-making ; provision of assistance in the legislative and regulatory fields ; and advisory services and training . 
Fourthly , FDI inflows should continue to be promoted by the per capita incomes in developing countries of the region , which are rising at higher rates than in the rest of the developing world , and increasing competition in the industrial as well as the developing countries and the resultant pressures on their transnational firms to locate abroad in search of reduced production cost and the strong likelihood of further liberalization of trade and investment policies in developing countries of the region . 
Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .  
We thank the UNCTAD secretariat for having convened this Expert Meeting , as well as for the preparatory work and the documentation , all of which is contributing to a more profound analysis of trade in relation to health services - an area in which many countries , largely developing countries like Cuba , are striving to become competitive in an international market dominated to all intents and purposes by the large transnational corporations . 
An indigenous participant from Northern Europe made a statement on behalf of several organizations about the drafting of some preliminary global guidelines on the working policies , practices and directives of transnational corporations operating in indigenous areas .  The guidelines included several aspects : prior informed consent and consultation with indigenous peoples ;  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
The Institute continued to use every opportunity , especially its biannual newsletter and its participation in subregional , regional and international meetings , to raise the awareness of all concerned that research in this area is the basis for developing effective practical measures to combat crime , especially transnational organized crime .  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
The tripartite forms of governance of employment policy established in many countries have increased cohesion and reduced conflict so long as they were genuinely inclusive of all kinds of workers , and need to be developed in ways that take account of the transnational nature of much economic activity .  
Recognizes that business and industry , including transnational corporations , play a crucial role in the social and economic development of a country , that a stable policy regime enables and encourages business and industry to operate responsibly and efficiently and to implement longer-term policies and that the activities of business and industry are the primary contributors to increasing prosperity , which is a major goal of the development process ;  
This approach illustrates that the United Nations is treated ultimately by Governments as a creature of national self-interest where national sovereignty is supreme , however and by whomever that is defined , and not equipped with conditions to reflect universal rights and growing transnational concerns .  
The Secretary-General alluded to this development in his report on the work of this Organization , where he recognized that the same technological means that foster globalization and the transnational expansion of civil society also provide the infrastructure for expanding global networks of uncivil society - organized crime , drug-traffickers , money-launderers and terrorists .  
If we are to be occupied , and not only preoccupied , with reform , let us reject , as incompatible with this Organization , the corporate and transnational approach promoted by some of the main United Nations contributors , as if this building were a stock exchange and the just desires of the peoples were mere merchandise .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
Today we are witnessing the emergence of new forms of transnational crime : money-laundering or the investment of capital generated by activities that are usually interconnected , including drug-trafficking , corruption , traffic in weapons , terrorism , traffic in nuclear and toxic material , traffic in protected natural resources , traffic in human beings , removal of organs , and more .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
Also , as the Secretary-General has noted elsewhere , the transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting the fulfilment of even national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
Member States shall promote bilateral , regional , multilateral and global law enforcement cooperation and assistance , including , as appropriate , mutual legal assistance arrangements , to facilitate the detection , apprehension and prosecution of those who commit or are otherwise responsible for serious transnational crimes and to ensure that law enforcement and other competent authorities can cooperate effectively on an international basis .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions , inter alia , through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business , and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection ,  
To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption , bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions , in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions , to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist , and to call upon private and public corporations , including transnational corporations , and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration ;  
Insufficient cooperation among law enforcement agencies , lack of appropriate controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle , corruption , legislative discrepancies with regard to bona fide possession of a motor vehicle in various regions of the world , a variety of registration practices and differences in the level of training of vehicle inspectors are generally indicated as factors facilitating the involvement of organized transnational crime in this profitable form of illicit trafficking .  
Algeria stated that , in the light of the need to provide States with effective instruments for international cooperation in the fight against organized transnational crime , it supported the spirit and principles embodied in the draft framework convention and hoped that such a convention could soon be adopted .  
Austria continued to be sceptical about the feasibility of elaborating a useful convention against organized transnational crime , as organized crime was a complex phenomenon that raised a number of legal issues that were not adequately covered in the draft .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Finally , Canada expressed the view that the ratification and implementation of existing international instruments represented a first step towards creating a comprehensive and successful legal framework for international cooperation against organized transnational crime .  
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
Finally , the United States pointed out that , although it was engaged in a continuous process of seeking and establishing , whenever possible , more effective bilateral and multilateral means of combating all forms of organized transnational crime , it agreed that the time had come to give serious consideration to the elaboration of a single new international convention in that area .  
Aware that organized crime , in its national and transnational dimensions , destabilizes international relations , including interregional , regional , subregional and bilateral cooperation , by exerting influence on politics , the media , public administration , judicial authorities and the economy by establishing commercial or business-like structures ,  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
They shall promote the harmonization of their countries ' national legislation on combating organized transnational crime and terrorism , including illegal trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances and precursors , explosives and other hazardous materials , hijacking of motor transport , counterfeiting , money-laundering , crime in the area of foreign economic and banking transactions and taxation , and illegal migration and illegal crossing of borders .  
We recognize that poverty , unemployment and other obstacles to human development , such as civil strife and war , as well as crime and social injustices , render our States and societies vulnerable to transnational organized crime and corruption ; and we are , therefore , resolved to undertake and intensify all necessary steps and measures to address such problems , with the cooperation and support of the international community .  
We also believe that concerted action at the international level can greatly benefit from closer and improved subregional and regional cooperation , which constitute a necessary complement to the global approach that is essential to deal with the dangers posed by the transnational forms of crime .  
We express our strong hope to participate in the work of the inter-sessional open-ended intergovernmental group of experts of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice1 charged with elaborating a preliminary draft of an international convention against organized transnational crime , so as to fully support the efforts of the Commission in elaborating such a convention , and we call upon the Commission to pursue those efforts as a matter of the utmost urgency .  
We call upon donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank , the African Development Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to give favourable consideration to project proposals on strengthening our national or regional capacities and creating the expertise required for the prevention and control of organized transnational crime and corruption , elaborated by the Division and submitted to them .  
We regard the project proposals that we have reviewed ( reflected in annex III of the report of the Regional Ministerial Workshop ) as viable and important regional initiatives , containing the basic elements of a concerted approach to the problems faced by all States of the region in the prevention and control of organized transnational crime , money-laundering and corruption .  
In his opening address , the Prime Minister of Senegal expressed the hope that the Regional Ministerial Workshop would focus on strengthening international cooperation in technical and substantive fields , in order to improve the professional skills of criminal justice personnel and thereby enable them to achieve greater success in the fight against organized transnational crime and corruption .  
The States participating in the Regional Ministerial Workshop decided that the early formulation of national positions was essential to ensure that their specific concerns would be appropriately reflected in the text of an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
For many developing countries , in particular LDCs and other structurally weak and vulnerable economies , supply-side constraints continue to limit their capabilities to take full advantage of new trading opportunities , become more attractive locations for foreign investment and integrate themselves into regional and global production networks of transnational enterprises .  
It must be recognized that at a time when economies and societies were becoming increasingly interdependent , as stated by the Secretary-General in the 1997 report on the world social situation , transnational forces that propel global changes , in particular mobile investment and finance , are weakening the ability of national Governments to influence economic and social outcomes , often putting fulfilment of even the national political commitments , not to mention the ability to influence global trends , beyond the reach of elected national representatives ( E / 1997 / 15 , p .  2 ) .  
Although not a substitute for treaty obligations already subscribed to by countries in the region , or for technical cooperation at the national level , subregional cooperation is a necessary complement making it possible more effectively to tackle issues that are mainly transnational in nature , such as trafficking of drugs and precursor chemicals , inadequate judicial cooperation and money-laundering .  
We also support the proposal to elaborate a comprehensive international legal instrument against transnational organized crime , which plays a central role in promoting illegal drug use and its attendant activities .  
It was emphasized by one speaker that poverty , unemployment , social injustice and unfair and imbalanced trade and economic relations should be considered factors that rendered States vulnerable to organized transnational crimes .  
The Commission expressed its concern about the growth of transnational organized crime , which was affecting the political stability and social and cultural values of societies all over the world , threatening national and global security .  
Also , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows swelled , reflecting continuing confidence of transnational corporations in the prospects of the region , despite the volatility associated with external monetary shocks .  
He expressed the Communitys concern at the growth of transnational organized crime whose many facets and increasing sophistication threatened not only national and global security but also political stability and social and cultural values the world over .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
It is understood that transnational organized crime exists when three or more persons agree to organize or are organized , on a permanent or recurrent basis , to commit acts that in themselves or when combined with others have as an objective or result the commission of a crime or crimes that are identified in article 2 and over which two or more States Parties have established their jurisdiction , in accordance with article 9 of this Convention .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .  
With the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance , those instruments provide a foundation for promoting and maintaining the rule of law , a basic requisite for sustainable socio-economic development ; furnish a basis for Governments to assess their systems , formulate legislation and develop effective tools for controlling national and transnational forms of crime ; and provide a framework for technical assistance , which in turn serves as a catalyst for their implementation .  
From Argentina to Ghana , State intervention in the economy has been drastically curtailed , protectionist barriers to Northern imports have been eliminated wholesale , restrictions on foreign investment have been lifted and , through export-first policies , internal economies have been more tightly integrated into the capitalist world market dominated by transnational corporations .  
Slovakia supported the establishment of an international fund for victims of crime and abuse of power , provided that the conditions that entitled a victim of international or transnational crime to redress by the international fund were restricted to incidents where national compensation and redress were unavailable or insufficient .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
$ 253,600 for general temporary assistance required for the temporary replacement of staff on extended sick leave or maternity leave ; temporary assistance during periods of peak workload due mainly to finalization of the convention against transnational organized crime and three additional international legal instruments ; and temporary assistance for the preparation and servicing of the sessions of the Commission ;  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , statistics , findings and results of action-oriented research , including high-quality analysis of and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and in corruption ;  
Specifically , Member States will have received timely and effective assistance upon request to deal with new crime challenges , especially transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings , economic and financial crimes and corruption .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
An important and recent concern has been the impact of transnational informational technology and mass media on peoples perceptions and expectations , in terms of their leading to or aggravating a conflict between expectations and realities , and between values and social roles , induced by the contrast between the cultures of rich countries and the pattern of opportunity in less well off societies .  
At its thirty-sixth session , in 1998 , the Commission for Social Development considered that while the primary responsibility for crime prevention and criminal justice rests at the national level , violence , crime and illicit drugs activities are of such magnitude and also have such major transnational dimensions that they require international cooperation and coordination in respect of formulating and implementing effective responses .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
Reaffirms that juvenile justice remains a high priority in the work of the Centre for International Crime Prevention and the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , in particular as children and young people , both those in conflict with the law and those in difficult circumstances who may be potential future criminals , are easy prey for criminal organizations closely linked with activities of transnational organized crime ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , subject to the availability of funds from the regular budget or extrabudgetary resources , to arrange for additional meetings to be scheduled for negotiation of the protocols , with a view to enhancing the potential for the expeditious and simultaneous completion of the convention against transnational organized crime and the protocols thereto ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
These included policy , legal and regulatory frameworks for sustained development of mineral resources best practices ; transnational corporations contribution in the mining and energy sectors ; new resources of capital for the development of Africas mineral resources : tapping capital markets ; and alternative approaches to financing energy and power development : case studies from African and other developing regions .  
Within its programme on the application of internationally established standards and norms in the fields of crime prevention and justice , as well as the provision of technical cooperation , the Centres overall objectives are to ( a ) promote international cooperation in crime prevention and control ; ( b ) support the development of criminal justice systems ; and ( c ) assist Member States in addressing the challenges and threats posed by the changing nature of transnational organized crime .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
Broad agreement was reached on the mechanisms for cooperation in the areas stipulated in the Declaration , including regular trilateral contacts among the heads of the foreign policy and other interested departments , and joint consultations at various levels , in particular with a view to counteracting the spread of aggressive religious and other extremism and combating terrorism , transnational organized crime and illicit traffic in drugs and arms .  
What links many of these seemingly disparate issues is an often inchoate , but nevertheless palpable , fear on the part of large numbers of thoughtful people , in developing , and developed countries alike , that impersonal forces beyond their control and accountable to no one - distant bureaucracies , mammoth transnational corporations , international organizations meeting behind closed doors - are taking over their lives .  
UNCTAD 's future work should aim at improving developing countries understanding of the impact of foreign direct investment , through transnational corporations , on international trade , technology flows , enterprise development and their development prospects generally .  
With regard to external conditions , developing countries faced disadvantages in global competition due , inter alia , to the technology and skills gap in agricultural production and quality control between developed countries and developing countries ; developing countries lack of capacity and expertise in the international marketing and transport of their products ; and a highly oligopolistic market structure in some major commodity markets controlled by large transnational corporations ( TNCs ) . 
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
To obtain the pertinent information , the Centre is currently finalizing a transnational organized crime assessment survey , which will be used to develop descriptive narratives based on both quantitative and qualitative information on the characteristics of the top 10 organized crime groups based in 12 selected countries and one region .  
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
In addition to its usual focus on international production and foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , the 1999 report reviews the issue of FDI and development and takes stock of the contributions of transnational corporations to development through capital formation , transfer of technology , export generation , creation of employment , skills transfer and environmental management . 
Governments , vulnerable to the threats of withdrawal from transnational companies and to political pressure from voters who were not prepared to change their lifestyles , had difficulty in maintaining social standards and affording the initial cost of moving to environmentally friendly technologies and behaviours .  
Globalization was the newest form of economic colonialism ; it made possible the efficient exploitation of vulnerable nations in the name of free markets and allowed transnational capitalists to rampage through the developing world , sometimes with the connivance , and even the active participation , of the rich elite of those poor countries . 
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Issues addressed with regard to the linkages between poverty and various vulnerable groups , including indigenous peoples , minorities , migrant workers and persons affected by AIDS , included social exclusion and marginalization , the exploitation of natural resources , transnational corporations and the impact of their activities on the enjoyment of the rights of communities concerned by such activities , as well as the overall policies of host Governments . 
The entry of transnational criminal operators in the financial world is believed to herald potential disruption , distortion of rules , erosion of ethics and suppression of competition ; ultimately , it is assumed to foster a purge among entrepreneurs , leading to the survival of those more criminally fit . 
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups . 
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,  
The delegations supporting its inclusion favoured a broad definition , as it would be conducive to the control of such trafficking , and noted that , while some of the listed devices were more likely to be used in armed conflicts or by terrorists , they were still likely to be trafficked by persons engaged in transnational organized crime .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
His delegation was convinced that an international convention against transnational organized crime would be an effective international legal instrument for Member States in their common struggle , and he hoped that preparatory work would be completed by 2000 .  
While rich countries have the transnational corporations that control over one third of all of the worlds exports , we poor countries have the asphyxiating burden of external debt , which has risen to the level of $ 2-trillion and continues to grow , devouring almost 25 per cent of our export earnings just to service our debt.How can development be possible under these conditions ? 
Taking place on the threshold of a new millennium , the Congress will serve as an unprecedented global forum to exchange and enhance innovative ideas from various relevant disciplines , demonstrate practical solutions and formulate common strategies to fight emerging crime issues , especially transnational crime .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
Many participants informed the Commission about their national laws and practical initiatives aimed at preventing crime , such as programmes to prevent domestic violence and sexual and violent crimes , as well as organized and transnational crime , and corruption .  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
The most serious worries are still the excessive or uncontrolled use of chemicals and toxic agricultural products and the harmful effects on the environment and health of the activities of foreign transplants and transnational companies , which are taking advantage of liberalization and deregulation to employ products and substances which are prohibited in the developed countries and to transfer highly polluting industries and those which produce large quantities of dangerous waste .  
Expresses its appreciation to the Government of Poland for acting as host to the meeting of the inter-sessional open-ended intergovernmental group of experts , established pursuant to resolution 52 85 , on the elaboration of a preliminary draft of a possible comprehensive international convention against organized transnational crime , held at Warsaw from 2 to 6 February 1998 ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Aware of the increasing rate if illicit movement and dumping by transnational corporations and other enterprises from industrialized countries of hazardous and other wastes in African and other developing countries that do not have the national capacity to deal with them in an environmentally sound manner , which constitutes a serious threat to the human rights to life , good health and a sound environment for everyone ,  
He noted that the recent upsurge in transnational crime had resulted in the penetration of central Asia by criminal groups and that the development of effective legislative frameworks and legal mechanisms for fighting crime had become a priority of the new sovereign States in that area .  
He reported that the Centre had reinforced its technical cooperation efforts and refocused its work on the future challenges and mandates that would arise from the convention , especially through its newly launched global programme against corruption , global programme against trafficking in human beings and global studies on transnational organized crime .  
The Chinese Criminal Code widely reflected international experience in preventing and controlling transnational organized crime , and Chinese law enforcement agencies , with their special squads for dealing with such crime , had achieved notable successes in joint efforts with their counterparts from other countries . 
Illegal trafficking in and transporting of migrants shall mean any act committed by a transnational organized criminal group for the purpose of procuring the undocumented or irregular entry of a person into a State of which the person is not a national or resident ;  
Current legal frameworks , policies and strategies , the report concludes , have proven inadequate to deal effectively with this complex transnational problem , and coordination , at both the national and international level , has been the exception rather than the rule .  
The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .  
The Italian Government is convinced that bilateral or regional agreements are not enough to meet the need for prompt collaboration in investigating and prosecuting transnational crimes committed by organized crime groups .  
This illicit and inhumane business is of a complex and transnational nature , and the wide range of organized crime that it creates is disrupting normal life in eastern Iran and adversely affecting the rest of the country .  
Participants also recognized the valuable work performed by the Centre in implementing the global programmes against corruption , trafficking in human beings and transnational organized crime at the regional and national levels .
