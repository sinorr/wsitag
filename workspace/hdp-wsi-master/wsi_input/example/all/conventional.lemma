For months , the officers and men - fighting with the stormy waves , keeping away from hidden reefs and crossing island chains deep down the ocean - had been exploring the way in unfamiliar waters , venturing into " deadly sea areas , " and struggling with Pacific storms .  Deep down the " Dragon King 's palace , " they set a new long voyage record in the history of conventional submarines .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
Their reports and articles were lengthy , full of empty and exaggerated talk and conventional phrases , written in stereotyped writing styles , and involved no fresh and substantial things at all .  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
The socialist market economic structure is the designated model for the economic structural reform in China , it marks the forsaking of the highly centralized conventional planned economic structure of the past , and it is substantially different from the capitalist market economy .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
It is understood that the development of this large piece of training equipment , which can conduct total-system simulation of real equipment , was tackled as an assault mission and completed in three months by a " shock brigade " made up of 29 experts at the college .  It was over seven times more efficient than conventional development , providing strong technical support for the fast generation of combat capability from new equipment .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Under the situation of weakness of comprehensive national strength and being inferior to NATO in conventional forces , nuclear weapons will remain an effective deterrent power of Russia in the future period and the " tower of strength " to support Russia 's desire to be a major military power .  
In our research and explorations , we should be mindful of avoiding and overcoming research methods that are isolated and focus on separate points only , be mindful of avoiding and overcoming the conventional thinking that looks at only a single , specific object , and observe and analyze issues from multiple dimensions and angles , so that our research takes on more characteristics of the times and that the theory and practice of joint operations can better cater to the development of the times .  
Following the reform , the Navy will be reorganized into 8-10 integrated fleets , with each fleet equipped with one nuclear-powered submarine , 8-10 conventional modified submarines , two missile destroyers , 6-8 frigates and missile gunboats , and four auxiliary vessels .  
Ground-to-air missiles , aviation missiles , ship-to-ship missiles , anti-tank missiles , conventional missiles , offensive tactical missiles , strategic nuclear missiles , and continental strategic missiles moved through Tiananmen Square , and almost all the new missile types from China 's guided missile family made their appearances .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
In order to achieve its strategic intention of building a " US unipolar world , " the United States aims to possess the world 's most advanced conventional and nuclear weapons and to maintain the world 's most powerful conventional and nuclear arsenal and to comprehensively raise its technical superiority , in a bid to ensure its " overwhelmingly superior dominant status in every kind of conflict " and " successfully fight two major theater wars that occur almost simultaneously . "  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
Hoping to Possess Sophisticated Secret WeaponsAccording to the informed source , the meeting emphasized that in view of the ever-changing international situation and the havoc wrought by hegemonism and power politics in the new period , our army must possess high-tech deterrence conventional weapons , high-tech deterrence nuclear weapons and two or three types of high-tech deterrence sophisticated secret weapons to guarantee national security and territorial integrity and ensure that China 's sovereignty will not be violated . 
As for the purchase of submarines from the United States , a naval officer indicated that , if the United States reopens its closed production lines to produce submarines powered by conventional diesel engines , the costs of the submarines [ that Taiwan intended to buy ] would be substantially higher .  He said political factors are also important issues the United States has to consider before it decides whether to sell submarines to Taiwan . He said in the future the United States might assist Taiwan to build its own submarines by providing Taiwan with technical support .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
Wang Yunkun said , " In real life , we must take pains to integrate the enthusiasm for accelerated development with the scientific attitude of operating in accordance with objective laws .  We can not stick to the conventional way of doing things , but nor can we rush ahead blindly , kill the goose that lays the golden eggs , or duplicate low-level projects , not to mention merely paying lip service or practicing formalism . "  
To achieve an attractive environment , conventional high-rise office-type development will be replaced by a comprehensively designed commercial ' groundscraper ' with a landscaped deck providing free pedestrian access from Statute Square to the future recreational / tourism - related facilities along the waterfront .  
As to the conventional overseas markets , exports to the United States also rebounded to a strong positive growth , on the back of sustained robust consumer demand in the country and with the negative impact of the earlier currency depreciation of the East Asian economies gradually dissipated .  
FAO and WHO have recommended that safety assessment based upon the concept of substantial equivalence be applied in establishing the safety of GMF , i.e . if a new food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component , it can be treated as safe as the conventional food or food component .  
The special fine screen printing method applied on the set issued today is far more refined than conventional printing , making the very exquisite details of these colourful insects visible to the eye of philatelists .  
We have seen internationally competitive research work , both basic and applied , from one of the smallest nanotubes in the world to the breakthrough discovery and use of maternal plasma DNA for the diagnosis of foetal deformities without the need for invasive and therefore dangerous conventional methods .  
Upon the decease of a parent , the mourners first erect a paper tabletas a temporary home for his spirit . Meanwhile a wooden tablet is prepared with the parent 's name and the conventional funerary inscription written on it , all except for the dot on top of the final character chu . This dot must be added by someone well acquainted with the deceased and of impeccable virtue , whereupon the paper tablet is incinerated .  
His strange dress and vulgar language might have sold a million recordings , maintained the critic , but this kind of marketing would certainly shorten his real musical career . The response from the musician was to strip off his conventional dinner suit and black tie during a performance of Bach , revealing a garish purple jacket and shirt . He then accused the critic of making classical music an issue of class and the preserve of the elite .  
There is still much room for discussion about whether zoos should be closed , but those trying to maintain a little conventional dignity must be careful in censuring others as inhumane . Children may not be grateful to us for closing zoos , but if zoos use destroying the natural environment as an excuse to exist , then the next generation will be even less grateful , I 'm afraid !  
" A lot of people in society have something to say , " affirms Liu Ta-chwan , network director for Chiao Tung University 's computer center . What gives the Net a superior edge over the conventional broadcast media is that radio talk shows have inherent time limitations , and they can cut callers off if they do n't like what is being said . The BBS is different . " It is basically very fair , because the capacity is unlimited . "  
Comic books are immediately accessible , because they are direct and have emotional impact . This is one of the special features of the graphic narrative . And they are no different from conventional books - - they can be divided into ones which merely stimulate the senses , and ones which contain deep thought .  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
Such endings are both happy and tragic , for they never go outside the conventional standards of life in the material world . Even today , many parents are tied to the notion that " in books one will naturally find a face as pretty as jade , " and admonish their children to " study hard-once you pass the exams and get into university , there 'll be plenty of pretty girls ! "  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
At left are pictured conventional ( above ) and " earth bull " ( below ) tops . Though different in shape ( the former are conical and solid , the latter tubular ) , they share one thing in common : it 's not that easy to use them well !  
The growth of alternative medicine reflected " a gnawing dissatisfaction with conventional , or ' allopathic ' medicine . " For all Western medicine 's brilliant achievements , such as vaccines , penicillin and organ transplants , it also had some severe failings , and the one most complained about was the endless waiting for doctors who viewed one as a sore back , an inoperable tumor or a cardiac case , but never as a person .  
Ripple employs a concentric-ring design . The piece is shaped like a conventional water jug , with handles modeled after the curved roof gable ( ma bei ) typical of traditional Fujian-style farmhouse architecture . Yet in spite of its conventional shape , the piece exudes an aura of serenity reminiscent of an era gone by . Chang relates the impetus for this creation : " As a boy I liked to throw rocks into a roadside pond , or the well outside our house , and watch as the ripples spread out .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
Turning to cross-strait matters , President Chen , pointing to the recent enlargement of the European Union , declared that the trend toward regionalization has led to fundamental changes in conventional thinking about national sovereignty and territorial boundaries , and expressed hope that leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait would heed this trend and adopt a fresh new framework to find a way out of the tense cross-strait situation .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
We regret to observe , however , that the spread of conventional arms continues to take on a dangerous magnitude , while at the same time armed conflicts are increasing , causing the tragic loss of numerous innocent human lives .  
Recognition is now emerging that conventional economic analysis methods , as applied to agricultural projects that do not take into account the degradation of the natural resource base , do not provide a suitable measure of longterm sustainability .  
However , the international transfer of conventional arms as well as the increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking , have in recent decades acquired a dimension and qualitative characteristics that give rise to serious and urgent concerns .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of the illicit arms trade ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that the illicit arms traffic is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon , and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of the illicit arms traffic increase .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
While negotiations on conventional weapons , with a view to restricting the use of land-mines , and on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty are moving ahead satisfactorily , we can not ignore the unconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , a major , if flawed , disarmament instrument .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
While the countries with the largest and most sophisticated nuclear and conventional arsenals have concluded some treaties on nuclear disarmament , it must be emphasized , however , that they have a special responsibility for disarmament and should make further efforts to implement those treaties in earnest so as to bring about further drastic cuts in their nuclear armaments .  
This implies the need for the development of creative partnerships among nations and between the public and private sectors , by means of which nations and institutions can establish collaborative ventures for technology transfer ; technology can then be acquired and adapted through conventional programmes , such as training , information exchange and access to patent information .  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Discussion at the United Nations focused on issues such as limitations on conventional weapons ; transparency in international arms transfers and arms production ; curbing the illicit traffic in conventional arms ; transparency in military expenditures ; inhumane weapons and the Convention restricting their use ; and , recently , regulation of the transfer of technology with military applications .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
UNMIH will then gradually expand its presence in each of the operational zones by deploying conventional forces to base camps that will be constructed throughout the country and by actively patrolling from the base camps to ensure that the local governmental , social , and economic institutions can operate unhindered .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
The increased importance of transparency in the transfer and possession of conventional arms and the growing international interest in such transparency are justified by the fact that such weapons are virtually untouched by existing legislation and can cause serious human suffering .  
Support is provided by United Nations specialized agencies to each of these programmes , in which satellite observation and electronic communications systems are employed along with conventional national and regional telecommunications systems for the interpretation and dissemination of early-warning information for participating countries .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of illicit arms trafficking .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
Operative paragraph 9 recommends that , pursuant to the adopted three-item phased approach , the Disarmament Commission , at its 1996 organizational session , adopt the following items for consideration at its 1997 substantive session : ( a ) the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; ( b ) the fourth special session of the General devoted to disarmament ; and ( c ) the new agenda item on conventional weapons , to be decided by the Disarmament Commission at this session .  
Where alternative programmes target special population groups , however , their success rate is high , equal to the peer-led programmes and with better results than conventional drug education programmes . 35 The successful programmes are those that have been individualized to meet the needs of each client and those that have included activities to enhance personal competence , such as reading skills and job skills , as well as physical adventure .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
Both sides will make efforts and cooperate with other countries for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , value the speedy coming into effect of the Chemical Weapons Convention and call for accelerated progress in further improving the effectiveness of the Biological Weapons Convention . The two sides are ready to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation on effective and responsible oversight of transfers of conventional weapons , particularly to regions of conflict .  
It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .  
Many delegations were concerned that subprogramme 1.3 emphasized the micro rather than the macro aspects of disarmament such as nuclear , chemical , bacteriological and conventional weapons .  
Another project , entitled " Interpretation of SAR Data and Preparation of Geologic , Seismic Zonation , and Geohazard Maps for Portions of Luzon , Philippines " , utilized interpretations of conventional aerial photographs , detailed geotechnical investigations and reviews of geologic and geophysical information , and combined them with interpretations of SAR data that had been collected by INTERA .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

Like other Member States , Israel considered article 20 to be complex and sometimes confusing because it attempted to include all the major conventional sources of international law , irrespective of the extent to which they had been accepted as law by the international community .  
As to allegations that the host country was ignoring legal instruments on diplomatic privileges and immunities and interfering with the functioning of the Cuban Mission , he reiterated the United States Mission 's position that the applicable principles of conventional and customary international law neither prohibited the imposition of travel restrictions nor entitled the affected individuals to unrestricted travel throughout the United States .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
At its organizational session , the Commission decided to include three substantive items on its 1997 agenda : item 4 Establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; item 5 Fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ; and item 6 Guidelines on conventional arms control / limitation and disarmament , with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 N . Three Working Groups were established to deal with these agenda items . 
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
The nature of the interventions will vary according to the specific context , but the measures outlined below , among others , may be considered in the interest of consolidating national security , preventing further regional proliferation and combating illicit arms trafficking ( understood to cover international trade in conventional arms that is contrary to the law of States and / or international law ) , thereby contributing to conflict prevention in the process of post-conflict peace-building .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
Less expensive than major conventional weapons , ready to use without extensive prior training , particularly against civilians , and fit for transport on a person , pack animal or light vehicle , small arms and light weapons are often the weapons of choice in such situations .  
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The Middle East region represents a case in point , where the qualitative imbalance in terms of armaments is so striking and where transparency and confidence can only come about if approached in a balanced and comprehensive way .  Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons , while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .  
While welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction , Mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons , which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .  
Instead of uprooting the family from its permanent place of residence , many would-be migrants find it preferable to maintain dual , sometimes triple , residences , and conventional dichotomies of rural / urban , agriculture / industry , proletariat / peasantry are becoming blurred .  
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
In the area of geological map configuration , the combined working methods of remote sensing technology and large-scale multi-picture surveys have reduced the actual costs by one third and the length of field survey routes by about one half compared with conventional methods .  Remote sensing technology has also been applied in archaeology , prospecting , railway and highway construction and marine information services .  
Article 27 , subparagraph ( b ) appeared to have excluded from its scope strictly bilateral treaty obligations in which State C was not bound by any rule contained in a treaty concluded between States A and B . On the other hand , as it currently stood , article 27 covered not only the case of obligations erga omnes but also rules of general international law to which both States were subject , such as rules on diplomatic relations , whether conventional or customary . 
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
It is doubtful whether the distinction , although interesting from the theoretical point of view , affects the scope of draft guideline 1.5.1 : either the treaty will be considered to have two actual parties ( despite the number of those contracting ) , and that situation is covered by draft guideline 1.5.1 , or the statement is made by one constituent of the multiple party and is a conventional reservation within the meaning of draft guideline 1.1 .  
It was agreed to exclude from the study unilateral acts subject to special legal regimes such as , inter alia , those based on conventional law , reservations to treaties and declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
The recommended doctrine confirms India 's craving to be recognized as a global Power - not by acting as a responsible member of the international community but through nuclear and conventional militarization and aggressive actions .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
It is also demonstrated by our vigorous efforts to foster a shared vision to reverse the conventional wisdom of the past , which sacrificed environmental concerns in blind pursuit of that other ideology of economic growth . 
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
Ecuador attaches the utmost importance to the Ottawa Convention , because we are convinced that it strengthens and improves upon the principles of international humanitarian law that are applicable to armed conflict , consolidates respect for disarmament conventions , especially those relating to controls on conventional arms that have especially harmful and indiscriminate effects , and , in particular , fosters and strengthens peace .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
To be sure , global conventional energy resources are adequate to meet the projected growth in energy services for decades to come , provided that technology is developed to exploit and utilize these resources in an efficient manner ; the total energy resource base is expected to be expanded by the development and application of renewable sources .  
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
This is also true for the more general subject of transparency in conventional weapons , where we consider the Conference can and must complete the valuable work accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee established between the years 1992 and 1995 , to define concrete measures likely to increase confidence amongst States and strengthen international security .  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
While weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons , continue to be of primary concern , the international community has expressed increasing concern about the proliferation of conventional weapons , especially small arms and light weapons .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States had dismantled more than 13,000 warheads , a process which included the physical separation of the warheads conventional high explosive from its fissile material .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
At the same time , it was responsible for merging conventional quantitative safeguards and more recent , qualitative safeguards into an integrated safeguards system , one that would be flexible , effective , and above all costefficient . 
These are clear forms of human loss which ( if the act causing them is recognized by the relevant legal system as wrongful ) can be compensated for in monetary terms , even though their assessment will always be a conventional and highly approximate matter .  
The resources devoted to huge arsenals nuclear and conventional take up the funds that could be devoted to economic development and social progress , which is of great importance to the people of developed and developing countries alike .  
Our national and regional security is best enhanced through the development of an international security system and through the removal of the threat to peace posed by weapons of mass destruction and the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
We firmly believe that the Final Document of the General Assemblys special session devoted to disarmament in 1978 rightly stated that the main priority should be granted to nuclear disarmament and weapons of mass destruction , and , afterward , conventional weapons .  
Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction and , in particular , nuclear weapons , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
In implementing its interim programme , the Government thus faces a serious problem of external financing , which is essential in view of the countrys meagre domestic resources and the unresolved problem of its external debt arrears , which stands in the way of conventional official development assistance mechanisms .  
This strategy is designed to be consistent with existing treaties , protocols and resolutions relevant to mine action , including , but not limited to , the anti-personnel mine ban treaty , the Convention on certain conventional weapons and its Protocols , the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols of 1977 , the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the standard rules for the disabled . 6 The strategy is intended to assist Member States to fulfil their international obligations and to support the universalization of relevant international instruments . 
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .  
For months , the officers and men - fighting with the stormy waves , keeping away from hidden reefs and crossing island chains deep down the ocean - had been exploring the way in unfamiliar waters , venturing into " deadly sea areas , " and struggling with Pacific storms .  Deep down the " Dragon King 's palace , " they set a new long voyage record in the history of conventional submarines .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
Their reports and articles were lengthy , full of empty and exaggerated talk and conventional phrases , written in stereotyped writing styles , and involved no fresh and substantial things at all .  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Third , complexity and uncertainty is constantly growing in the international security environment .  Along with economic globalization , the current rapid development of modern information technology , and the deepening of the new military revolution , both conventional and unconventional security problems have come to the front at the same time ; and the security environment of many countries , especially developing countries , has become more severe and more vulnerable .  
The socialist market economic structure is the designated model for the economic structural reform in China , it marks the forsaking of the highly centralized conventional planned economic structure of the past , and it is substantially different from the capitalist market economy .  
On the contrary , the gap between weaponry based on new scientific principles and old-fashioned weaponry can not be readily bridged with tactics .  Examples are the gaps between hot weapons and cold weapons , between mechanized weapons and human power , between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons .  These days developed countries are researching and developing " new concept weapons " such as kinetic energy weapons , directional energy weapons , meteorological weapons , subsonic weapons , and artificial intelligence weapons , which may lead to a breakthrough in the nature of weaponry .  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
It is understood that the development of this large piece of training equipment , which can conduct total-system simulation of real equipment , was tackled as an assault mission and completed in three months by a " shock brigade " made up of 29 experts at the college .  It was over seven times more efficient than conventional development , providing strong technical support for the fast generation of combat capability from new equipment .  
According to the experienced Indian military analyst ( Kapil Kaq ) , " this joint military exercise is multilevel and is also the first time that India has shown that it has already made preparations in pragmatic fashion for fighting a limited conventional war ; India 's conventional military forces remain in a high state of combat readiness and will sternly retaliate on a large scale against an enemy . "  
Under the situation of weakness of comprehensive national strength and being inferior to NATO in conventional forces , nuclear weapons will remain an effective deterrent power of Russia in the future period and the " tower of strength " to support Russia 's desire to be a major military power .  
In our research and explorations , we should be mindful of avoiding and overcoming research methods that are isolated and focus on separate points only , be mindful of avoiding and overcoming the conventional thinking that looks at only a single , specific object , and observe and analyze issues from multiple dimensions and angles , so that our research takes on more characteristics of the times and that the theory and practice of joint operations can better cater to the development of the times .  
Following the reform , the Navy will be reorganized into 8-10 integrated fleets , with each fleet equipped with one nuclear-powered submarine , 8-10 conventional modified submarines , two missile destroyers , 6-8 frigates and missile gunboats , and four auxiliary vessels .  
Ground-to-air missiles , aviation missiles , ship-to-ship missiles , anti-tank missiles , conventional missiles , offensive tactical missiles , strategic nuclear missiles , and continental strategic missiles moved through Tiananmen Square , and almost all the new missile types from China 's guided missile family made their appearances .  
It is said that during the amphibious landing joint military exercise on Dongshan Island , the Chinese Communist once more used large commercial vessels to ship supporting firepower cannons and rockets .  The purpose is nothing more than making up for the severe shortage of conventional amphibious landing vessels .  But this action will only be feasible under the condition of possessing superior naval and air forces .  These vessels are big and weak targets , but not a miraculous cure as they appear to be .  
In order to achieve its strategic intention of building a " US unipolar world , " the United States aims to possess the world 's most advanced conventional and nuclear weapons and to maintain the world 's most powerful conventional and nuclear arsenal and to comprehensively raise its technical superiority , in a bid to ensure its " overwhelmingly superior dominant status in every kind of conflict " and " successfully fight two major theater wars that occur almost simultaneously . "  
The United States has already possessed the world 's most advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and now it is making great efforts to develop NMD . This goes against the trend of the times and is also unfavorable to international arms control and efforts in disarmament .  It will have a serious and negative impact on maintaining a global and regional strategic balance and stability in the 21st century .  
Hoping to Possess Sophisticated Secret WeaponsAccording to the informed source , the meeting emphasized that in view of the ever-changing international situation and the havoc wrought by hegemonism and power politics in the new period , our army must possess high-tech deterrence conventional weapons , high-tech deterrence nuclear weapons and two or three types of high-tech deterrence sophisticated secret weapons to guarantee national security and territorial integrity and ensure that China 's sovereignty will not be violated . 
As for the purchase of submarines from the United States , a naval officer indicated that , if the United States reopens its closed production lines to produce submarines powered by conventional diesel engines , the costs of the submarines [ that Taiwan intended to buy ] would be substantially higher .  He said political factors are also important issues the United States has to consider before it decides whether to sell submarines to Taiwan . He said in the future the United States might assist Taiwan to build its own submarines by providing Taiwan with technical support .  
Shu Huiguo , secretary of the Jiangxi province CPC committee , said : Currently , China 's conventional agriculture is being transformed into modern agriculture and the market of agricultural and sideline products is being transformed from one catering to basic living needs into one catering for things required for living a relatively comfortable life .  Therefore , we will be unable to achieve major development without adjusting the agricultural structure .  
Wang Yunkun said , " In real life , we must take pains to integrate the enthusiasm for accelerated development with the scientific attitude of operating in accordance with objective laws .  We can not stick to the conventional way of doing things , but nor can we rush ahead blindly , kill the goose that lays the golden eggs , or duplicate low-level projects , not to mention merely paying lip service or practicing formalism . "  
To achieve an attractive environment , conventional high-rise office-type development will be replaced by a comprehensively designed commercial ' groundscraper ' with a landscaped deck providing free pedestrian access from Statute Square to the future recreational / tourism - related facilities along the waterfront .  
As to the conventional overseas markets , exports to the United States also rebounded to a strong positive growth , on the back of sustained robust consumer demand in the country and with the negative impact of the earlier currency depreciation of the East Asian economies gradually dissipated .  
FAO and WHO have recommended that safety assessment based upon the concept of substantial equivalence be applied in establishing the safety of GMF , i.e . if a new food or food component is found to be substantially equivalent to an existing food or food component , it can be treated as safe as the conventional food or food component .  
The special fine screen printing method applied on the set issued today is far more refined than conventional printing , making the very exquisite details of these colourful insects visible to the eye of philatelists .  
We have seen internationally competitive research work , both basic and applied , from one of the smallest nanotubes in the world to the breakthrough discovery and use of maternal plasma DNA for the diagnosis of foetal deformities without the need for invasive and therefore dangerous conventional methods .  
Upon the decease of a parent , the mourners first erect a paper tabletas a temporary home for his spirit . Meanwhile a wooden tablet is prepared with the parent 's name and the conventional funerary inscription written on it , all except for the dot on top of the final character chu . This dot must be added by someone well acquainted with the deceased and of impeccable virtue , whereupon the paper tablet is incinerated .  
His strange dress and vulgar language might have sold a million recordings , maintained the critic , but this kind of marketing would certainly shorten his real musical career . The response from the musician was to strip off his conventional dinner suit and black tie during a performance of Bach , revealing a garish purple jacket and shirt . He then accused the critic of making classical music an issue of class and the preserve of the elite .  
There is still much room for discussion about whether zoos should be closed , but those trying to maintain a little conventional dignity must be careful in censuring others as inhumane . Children may not be grateful to us for closing zoos , but if zoos use destroying the natural environment as an excuse to exist , then the next generation will be even less grateful , I 'm afraid !  
" A lot of people in society have something to say , " affirms Liu Ta-chwan , network director for Chiao Tung University 's computer center . What gives the Net a superior edge over the conventional broadcast media is that radio talk shows have inherent time limitations , and they can cut callers off if they do n't like what is being said . The BBS is different . " It is basically very fair , because the capacity is unlimited . "  
Comic books are immediately accessible , because they are direct and have emotional impact . This is one of the special features of the graphic narrative . And they are no different from conventional books - - they can be divided into ones which merely stimulate the senses , and ones which contain deep thought .  
" Although Air Macau has its strong points , we are also increasing our efforts , " comments TransAsia Airway 's public relations office . After passengers reach Macao , in addition to the conventional method of disembarking and boarding a second flight to mainland China , TransAsia also offers a free bus service which takes their customers straight to Guangdong 's Zhuhai City in little more than an hour . From Zhuhai 's newly completed Sanzao International Airport , one can then fly to all the major cities in mainland China .  
Such endings are both happy and tragic , for they never go outside the conventional standards of life in the material world . Even today , many parents are tied to the notion that " in books one will naturally find a face as pretty as jade , " and admonish their children to " study hard-once you pass the exams and get into university , there 'll be plenty of pretty girls ! "  
The Ministry of Education also has plans to establish " community colleges , " but their main goal is to give those students from the technical and vocational educational stream who are unable to squeeze in through the narrow doors of the conventional universities an extra opportunity to gain a university-level qualification ; the aims do not seem very different from those behind the establishment of the old night schools or today 's Open University .  
A few days ago my old friend Hsieh Chun-teh let me have a look at his most recent book , an experimental collection of 50 digital images that he has spent the last five years working on . Comparing it with the works he has published using conventional photographic techniques , I feel that , in terms of both form and content , he has gone beyond his old self , and he has also showed how photographers of the future can make use of digital imaging technology .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
It aims to bring together leading political and other figures who place Taiwan at the center of their thinking . It also claims to be a third force outside the conventional political structure that has established a partnership with the current administration , which shares similar ideals , and to be a " do tank " that gives equal emphasis to planning and to practice .  
At left are pictured conventional ( above ) and " earth bull " ( below ) tops . Though different in shape ( the former are conical and solid , the latter tubular ) , they share one thing in common : it 's not that easy to use them well !  
The growth of alternative medicine reflected " a gnawing dissatisfaction with conventional , or ' allopathic ' medicine . " For all Western medicine 's brilliant achievements , such as vaccines , penicillin and organ transplants , it also had some severe failings , and the one most complained about was the endless waiting for doctors who viewed one as a sore back , an inoperable tumor or a cardiac case , but never as a person .  
Ripple employs a concentric-ring design . The piece is shaped like a conventional water jug , with handles modeled after the curved roof gable ( ma bei ) typical of traditional Fujian-style farmhouse architecture . Yet in spite of its conventional shape , the piece exudes an aura of serenity reminiscent of an era gone by . Chang relates the impetus for this creation : " As a boy I liked to throw rocks into a roadside pond , or the well outside our house , and watch as the ripples spread out .  
To most people , railroad warehouses are nothing but dark and dilapidated buildings , but to artists such spaces exert a primordial attraction not found in conventional art galleries . These surreal art sanctuaries give free rein to the imagination , enable the artistic vanguard to enter the mainstream , and function as alternative spaces for the experimental showcasing of new designs prior to commercial exhibition .  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
Turning to cross-strait matters , President Chen , pointing to the recent enlargement of the European Union , declared that the trend toward regionalization has led to fundamental changes in conventional thinking about national sovereignty and territorial boundaries , and expressed hope that leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait would heed this trend and adopt a fresh new framework to find a way out of the tense cross-strait situation .  
American medical science began to study the human foot after World War II , when a great many American soldiers who had suffered foot injuries required special medical treatment . The manufacture of orthopedic footwear and auxiliary equipment proved to be particularly troublesome for conventional medicine .  
We regret to observe , however , that the spread of conventional arms continues to take on a dangerous magnitude , while at the same time armed conflicts are increasing , causing the tragic loss of numerous innocent human lives .  
Recognition is now emerging that conventional economic analysis methods , as applied to agricultural projects that do not take into account the degradation of the natural resource base , do not provide a suitable measure of longterm sustainability .  
However , the international transfer of conventional arms as well as the increasing illicit and covert arms trafficking , have in recent decades acquired a dimension and qualitative characteristics that give rise to serious and urgent concerns .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of the illicit arms trade ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that the illicit arms traffic is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon , and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of the illicit arms traffic increase .  
High expectations violently oscillated with the doldrums of despair ; the exuberant relief of peoples ridding themselves of totalitarian rule alternated with the miserable anguish of occupation and ethnic cleansing ; rays of hope were paralleled by violent explosions of civil strife ; nuclear non-proliferation was countered by a devastating spread in the traffic in conventional weaponry ; peace for some was matched by wanton slaughter for others .  
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
Another main reason for this failure is that the policies of major arms-producing countries designed to control the spread of weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons are always short-sighted and discriminatory and aim simultaneously at securing the destructive power of their own weaponry and their own military dominance .  
While negotiations on conventional weapons , with a view to restricting the use of land-mines , and on the comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty are moving ahead satisfactorily , we can not ignore the unconditional and indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) , a major , if flawed , disarmament instrument .  
With the support and active cooperation of Committee members , I am certain that the First Committee of the General Assembly , at this historic fiftieth session , will be able to further contribute substantially towards attaining our common objective a world free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and with a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons and of violence in general .  
In short , the practical achievement of that purpose in the present international context entails preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , further strengthening existing conventions in this field , pursuing the process of nuclear disarmament , limiting and reducing existing conventional arsenals and establishing confidence - and security-building measures .  
I fully agree with the view expressed by the representative of Spain that , in all probability , it is on the regional level that increased confidence and greater transparency in military matters have the most significant , positive effects , especially as far as conventional weaponry is concerned .  
Greater transparency in military matters and the nurturing of confidence between States are the key elements required for bringing about the regional and global stability which would contribute to reducing excessive and illegal trade in conventional weapons .  
My delegation believes that all possible measures must be sought to put an end to illicit arms transfers and , in conformity with the Final Document of the tenth special session of the General Assembly , the first devoted to disarmament , all arms suppliers and recipients should coordinate their policies on the limitation of all types of international transfers of conventional weapons for achieving the ultimate goal of complete transparency in this field .  
Despite the achievements of the first half of the Decade in reducing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and also in limiting conventional weapons , the road towards the noble objective of the Third Disarmament Decade remains a long and winding one .  
While the countries with the largest and most sophisticated nuclear and conventional arsenals have concluded some treaties on nuclear disarmament , it must be emphasized , however , that they have a special responsibility for disarmament and should make further efforts to implement those treaties in earnest so as to bring about further drastic cuts in their nuclear armaments .  
This implies the need for the development of creative partnerships among nations and between the public and private sectors , by means of which nations and institutions can establish collaborative ventures for technology transfer ; technology can then be acquired and adapted through conventional programmes , such as training , information exchange and access to patent information .  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
Further areas of concern related to biological weapons , new types of weapons of mass destruction , radiological weapons , limitation and reduction of conventional weapons and international arms transfers , the prevention of an arms race in outer space , curbing the naval arms race , naval armaments and disarmament , and reduction of military budgets .  
Discussion at the United Nations focused on issues such as limitations on conventional weapons ; transparency in international arms transfers and arms production ; curbing the illicit traffic in conventional arms ; transparency in military expenditures ; inhumane weapons and the Convention restricting their use ; and , recently , regulation of the transfer of technology with military applications .  
Analysis of the major factors behind the observed behaviour of commodity prices reveals that conventional factors , such as the prevailing macroeconomic conditions in industrialized countries , are estimated to have contributed in only a limited way to the recent weakness in real commodity prices and that the expansion in the supply of commodities played a fundamental role .  
UNMIH will then gradually expand its presence in each of the operational zones by deploying conventional forces to base camps that will be constructed throughout the country and by actively patrolling from the base camps to ensure that the local governmental , social , and economic institutions can operate unhindered .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
The increased importance of transparency in the transfer and possession of conventional arms and the growing international interest in such transparency are justified by the fact that such weapons are virtually untouched by existing legislation and can cause serious human suffering .  
Support is provided by United Nations specialized agencies to each of these programmes , in which satellite observation and electronic communications systems are employed along with conventional national and regional telecommunications systems for the interpretation and dissemination of early-warning information for participating countries .  
Subsequently , pursuant to that resolution , the Secretary-General submitted a study ( A / 46 / 301 , annex ) , prepared with the assistance of governmental experts , on ways and means of promoting transparency in international transfers of conventional arms on a universal and non-discriminatory basis , taking into consideration the views of Member States and other relevant information , including information on the problem of illicit arms trafficking .  
By its resolution 48 / 75 F of 16 December 1993 , the General Assembly recognized that illicit arms trafficking is a disturbing , dangerous and increasingly common phenomenon and that , with the technical sophistication and destructive capability of conventional weapons , the destabilizing effects of illicit arms trafficking increase .  
While political , regional and ethnic conflicts , civil wars and the menace of armaments both nuclear and conventional are a major concern , Sierra Leone believes that the greatest threat to international peace and security today lies in poverty and in economic and social deprivation .  
We consider that the unanimous opinion that there is in neither customary nor conventional international law any specific authorization of the threat or use of nuclear weapons should become the legal and political foundation for greater progress towards total denuclearization . 
It establishes clearly , among other elements , the link and interdependence that exists between the processes of nuclear and conventional disarmament , conventional disarmament at the global level , the specific features of each region which must be taken into account the need for initiatives and participation by all States of the region concerned in the search for agreements on regional disarmament , and the danger posed by the excessive accumulation of weapons by States over and above their legitimate defence needs .  
The Final Declaration of the summit of Heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , meeting in Cartagena last year , expressed the Movement 's support for the convening of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament as being an opportunity to review , from a perspective more in tune with the current international situation , the most critical aspects of disarmament and to mobilize the international community and public opinion in favour of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and of the control and reduction of conventional weapons .  
Operative paragraph 9 recommends that , pursuant to the adopted three-item phased approach , the Disarmament Commission , at its 1996 organizational session , adopt the following items for consideration at its 1997 substantive session : ( a ) the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; ( b ) the fourth special session of the General devoted to disarmament ; and ( c ) the new agenda item on conventional weapons , to be decided by the Disarmament Commission at this session .  
Where alternative programmes target special population groups , however , their success rate is high , equal to the peer-led programmes and with better results than conventional drug education programmes . 35 The successful programmes are those that have been individualized to meet the needs of each client and those that have included activities to enhance personal competence , such as reading skills and job skills , as well as physical adventure .  
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
Both sides will make efforts and cooperate with other countries for an early conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , value the speedy coming into effect of the Chemical Weapons Convention and call for accelerated progress in further improving the effectiveness of the Biological Weapons Convention . The two sides are ready to step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation on effective and responsible oversight of transfers of conventional weapons , particularly to regions of conflict .  
It is expected that these materials will address , among other subjects : the conclusion of a comprehensive test-ban treaty , further developments in nuclear disarmament , entry into force of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , Production , Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction , substantive preparation for the review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in the year 2000 , preparations for a fourth special session on disarmament , conventional disarmament and transparency , and regional arrangements .  
Many delegations were concerned that subprogramme 1.3 emphasized the micro rather than the macro aspects of disarmament such as nuclear , chemical , bacteriological and conventional weapons .  
Another project , entitled " Interpretation of SAR Data and Preparation of Geologic , Seismic Zonation , and Geohazard Maps for Portions of Luzon , Philippines " , utilized interpretations of conventional aerial photographs , detailed geotechnical investigations and reviews of geologic and geophysical information , and combined them with interpretations of SAR data that had been collected by INTERA .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;

Like other Member States , Israel considered article 20 to be complex and sometimes confusing because it attempted to include all the major conventional sources of international law , irrespective of the extent to which they had been accepted as law by the international community .  
As to allegations that the host country was ignoring legal instruments on diplomatic privileges and immunities and interfering with the functioning of the Cuban Mission , he reiterated the United States Mission 's position that the applicable principles of conventional and customary international law neither prohibited the imposition of travel restrictions nor entitled the affected individuals to unrestricted travel throughout the United States .  
I am certain that the First Committee can make a significant contribution towards the attainment of our common objective : a world free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and a greatly reduced level of conventional weapons .  
The disarmament and international security agenda for the future can be comprehensively addressed with regard to both weapons of mass destruction and conventional weapons through the fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament .  
In considering the allocation of resources to disarmament , the United Nations should not only take into account the priority which this necessitates and the high emphasis given to it by the entire international community ; it should also be focused on the work that is already being done and still needs to be done by the international community on the future agenda to eliminate all weapons of mass destruction and to halt the proliferation of conventional weapons beyond the legitimate requirements of self-defence .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Calls upon the international community , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on those environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Armenia , which has seized 20 per cent of Azerbaijani territory and expelled more than 1-million Azerbaijanis from their homes , and which constantly accuses Azerbaijan of being unwilling to resolve the conflict through peaceful means , has in fact not halted and continues through all illegal means to build up its military potential , which is a gross violation of the provisions of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe , which regulates the admissible levels of conventional weapons for the countries parties to the Treaty .  
All three of these operational programmes are supporting the development of environmentally sound , renewable sources of commercial energy with demonstrated viability and the improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources .  
At the same time , this approach has not prevented Israel from supporting or taking part in the concerted effort of the international community to curb proliferation of either conventional or non _ conventional weapons and ballistic missiles and , where appropriate , to endorse global agreements which could complement those to be established at the regional level .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
Thirdly , it is necessary to prevent a small number of countries taking advantage of their advanced military technology and economic power to seek their absolute security and military superiority over others while they focus the target of disarmament on the developing countries and deprive them of their legitimate right and means of self-defence .  Fourthly , the countries with the largest and most sophisticated conventional and nuclear arsenals should continue to bear special responsibility for disarmament .  
Pakistan believes that we can succeed in realizing peace through a comprehensive and sustained dialogue which would seriously address , and progressively resolve , the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir in conformity with the relevant United Nations resolutions ; achieve mutual and equitable restraint on conventional weapons to ensure equal security to both Pakistan and India ; evolve agreement for mutual and equal restraint in the nuclear field and in ballistic missiles : and conclude and strengthen confidence-building measures .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
As far as transparency in the conventional weapons sphere is concerned , Jordan is of the view that unless the scope of the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms is broadened to encompass military holdings and procurement through national production , as well as stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction , effective operation of the Register can not be expected in the near future .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
At its organizational session , the Commission decided to include three substantive items on its 1997 agenda : item 4 Establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned ; item 5 Fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ; and item 6 Guidelines on conventional arms control / limitation and disarmament , with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 N . Three Working Groups were established to deal with these agenda items . 
As Member States will recall , this paper became a basis for General Assembly resolution 48 / 87 , by which the Assembly , among other things , further adopted a thematic approach to cluster items into 10 broad topics : nuclear weapons ; other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; confidence-building measures , including transparency in armaments ; outer space disarmament aspects ; disarmament machinery ; other disarmament measures ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
In order to rationalize the work of the First Committee , it would be useful to consider issues as groups of items or clusters for instance , nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction ; conventional weapons ; regional disarmament and security ; transparency and confidence-building ; outer space ; reports of multilateral organs ; disarmament machinery and institutional matters ; international security ; and related matters of disarmament and international security .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
With regard to disarmament , Algeria , the country in its geographical area that devotes the smallest percentage of its gross national product to national defence , fully endorses the basic right of security for all States , whose promotion necessarily entails , first , nuclear disarmament , followed by the elimination of other weapons of mass destruction and ending with the progressive and balanced reduction of conventional weapons at both the global and regional levels .  
We are of the view that given the positive global political climate following the end of the cold war , the work of the Conference has assumed even increased significance in that opportunities that did not exist during the period of heightened East _ West tension are now present , both in respect of conventional and , more importantly , nuclear disarmament .  
Policy makers in developing countries are faced with the dilemma of choosing between long-term solutions through technology transfer and capacity-building , including through cooperative arrangements with developed countries , and short-term solutions utilizing conventional methods and improvements of their information and management practices .  9 .  Essential for success in developing capabilities in the safe and sound use and management of biotechnologies appear to be the establishment of relevant research and development programmes , fostering research potential through a steady supply of qualified personnel , making investment capital available and providing private-sector incentives to invest in biotechnology .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
In paragraph 3 of the same resolution , the Assembly also invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with their views on ( a ) effective ways and means of collecting weapons transferred illicitly , in particular in the light of experience gained by the United Nations ; and ( b ) concrete proposals concerning measures at national , regional and international levels to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional arms .  
The nature of the interventions will vary according to the specific context , but the measures outlined below , among others , may be considered in the interest of consolidating national security , preventing further regional proliferation and combating illicit arms trafficking ( understood to cover international trade in conventional arms that is contrary to the law of States and / or international law ) , thereby contributing to conflict prevention in the process of post-conflict peace-building .  
For our part , I can confirm that the United Kingdom would like to see the agenda of the Conference on Disarmament reflect our key priorities on the disarmament agenda , and for the record I confirm that on the nuclear side , our top priority is the urgent negotiation and conclusion of a fissile material cut _ off treaty , and on the conventional side , our top priority is to work towards the global ban on APLs to complement the Ottawa treaty , which we hope will be opened for signature this December . 
Less expensive than major conventional weapons , ready to use without extensive prior training , particularly against civilians , and fit for transport on a person , pack animal or light vehicle , small arms and light weapons are often the weapons of choice in such situations .  
In our view , and as envisaged in the Register 's founding resolution ( General Assembly resolution 46 / 36 L ) , an expanded Register including data on advanced conventional weapons , on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear weapons , and on high technology with military applications would represent a more balanced , more comprehensive and less discriminatory instrument attracting a larger number of regular participants . 
The Middle East region represents a case in point , where the qualitative imbalance in terms of armaments is so striking and where transparency and confidence can only come about if approached in a balanced and comprehensive way .  Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons , while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
However , the increased international attention to , and importance of , transparency of transfers and possession of conventional arms are justified by the fact that these conventional arms cause serious human suffering in international and internal conflicts and are not subject to legal regimes in many parts of the world .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
It is our view that the CD can provide a unique focal point for drawing together these various strands and developing a longer _ term , global approach to meeting the challenge of the licit and illicit trade in conventional weapons and light arms .  
Threats to international peace and security have been posed not only by weapons of mass destruction but also by the excessive build-up of conventional weapons beyond a level considered legitimate for the purpose of self-defence .  
While welcoming also the notable progress made on instruments regarding weapons of mass destruction , Mali is deeply concerned about conventional weapons , which remain an area so far unexplored and not subject to international norms .  
This was noted by the Secretary-General , who stressed in his reform proposals that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance while at the same time the spread of conventional weapons , especially in relation to landmines and small arms , which were being used extensively in regional and subregional conflicts , had become of greater concern to the international community .  
The programme budget for the biennium 19961997 , as approved by the General Assembly , stated that the efforts of the international community were still focused on weapons of mass destruction , particularly nuclear ones , but were becoming increasingly concerned with the growth and proliferation of various types of conventional weapons ( A / 50 / 6 / Rev . 1,3 para .  2.81 ) .  The programme budget for the biennium 19981999 maintains the same approach .  
They pointed specifically to additional tasks and duties in the area of practical disarmament in the conventional field , the implementation of arms agreements regarding weapons of mass destruction , the facilitating of regional agreements and confidence-building measures and the current and future tasks associated with the implementation of international agreements on anti-personnel landmines ( A / 52 / 282 , para .  4 ) .  
Instead of uprooting the family from its permanent place of residence , many would-be migrants find it preferable to maintain dual , sometimes triple , residences , and conventional dichotomies of rural / urban , agriculture / industry , proletariat / peasantry are becoming blurred .  
These negative views were promoted daily and urbi et orbis by the most diverse methods ( scientific literature or simply by word of mouth ) and quickly became part of the conventional wisdom in large sections of the political and academic world , as well as for vast segments of the population at large , in the plurinational societies in which indigenous peoples continue to live today .  
In the area of geological map configuration , the combined working methods of remote sensing technology and large-scale multi-picture surveys have reduced the actual costs by one third and the length of field survey routes by about one half compared with conventional methods .  Remote sensing technology has also been applied in archaeology , prospecting , railway and highway construction and marine information services .  
Article 27 , subparagraph ( b ) appeared to have excluded from its scope strictly bilateral treaty obligations in which State C was not bound by any rule contained in a treaty concluded between States A and B . On the other hand , as it currently stood , article 27 covered not only the case of obligations erga omnes but also rules of general international law to which both States were subject , such as rules on diplomatic relations , whether conventional or customary . 
Following the end of cold war , the United Nations has been called upon to take up new challenges and tasks as a result of the growing threat from the existence of large stockpiles of nuclear weapons , proposals for ballistic missile defences and the weaponization of outer space , the lack of progress in the field of disarmament , the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the development and use of advanced and sophisticated conventional arms ;  
It is doubtful whether the distinction , although interesting from the theoretical point of view , affects the scope of draft guideline 1.5.1 : either the treaty will be considered to have two actual parties ( despite the number of those contracting ) , and that situation is covered by draft guideline 1.5.1 , or the statement is made by one constituent of the multiple party and is a conventional reservation within the meaning of draft guideline 1.1 .  
It was agreed to exclude from the study unilateral acts subject to special legal regimes such as , inter alia , those based on conventional law , reservations to treaties and declarations accepting the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
The recommended doctrine confirms India 's craving to be recognized as a global Power - not by acting as a responsible member of the international community but through nuclear and conventional militarization and aggressive actions .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
It is also demonstrated by our vigorous efforts to foster a shared vision to reverse the conventional wisdom of the past , which sacrificed environmental concerns in blind pursuit of that other ideology of economic growth . 
To this must be added the growing number of hotbeds of tension and conflict between and within States , the growing risk of outbreaks of ethnic , tribal and sectarian conflicts , greater risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , especially nuclear weapons , increased stockpiles of conventional weapons and the growth of terrorism as an international phenomenon that threatens democracy , human rights and international peace and security .  
Ecuador attaches the utmost importance to the Ottawa Convention , because we are convinced that it strengthens and improves upon the principles of international humanitarian law that are applicable to armed conflict , consolidates respect for disarmament conventions , especially those relating to controls on conventional arms that have especially harmful and indiscriminate effects , and , in particular , fosters and strengthens peace .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
To be sure , global conventional energy resources are adequate to meet the projected growth in energy services for decades to come , provided that technology is developed to exploit and utilize these resources in an efficient manner ; the total energy resource base is expected to be expanded by the development and application of renewable sources .  
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
Of course , they would love to see a world free of weapons of mass destruction , stockpiles of fissile material and above all , many fewer conventional weapons , to enable them to live a peaceful life.Are we anywhere near these objectives and aspirations ?  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
This is also true for the more general subject of transparency in conventional weapons , where we consider the Conference can and must complete the valuable work accomplished by the Ad Hoc Committee established between the years 1992 and 1995 , to define concrete measures likely to increase confidence amongst States and strengthen international security .  
Egypt regrets that all the efforts made to expand the scope of the United Nations Register have not yet yielded the required results since the Register remains limited to the annual notification of transfers of seven categories of conventional arms and continues to disregard other sophisticated and lethal types of conventional arms as well as weapons of mass destruction and advanced technologies with military applications .  
Recognizing that an enhanced level of transparency relating to both conventional weapons and weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons , as well as to high technology with military applications , would promote stability , strengthen regional and international peace and security , and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament ,  
While weapons of mass destruction , in particular nuclear weapons , continue to be of primary concern , the international community has expressed increasing concern about the proliferation of conventional weapons , especially small arms and light weapons .  
Since the end of the cold war , the United States had dismantled more than 13,000 warheads , a process which included the physical separation of the warheads conventional high explosive from its fissile material .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
At the same time , it was responsible for merging conventional quantitative safeguards and more recent , qualitative safeguards into an integrated safeguards system , one that would be flexible , effective , and above all costefficient . 
These are clear forms of human loss which ( if the act causing them is recognized by the relevant legal system as wrongful ) can be compensated for in monetary terms , even though their assessment will always be a conventional and highly approximate matter .  
The resources devoted to huge arsenals nuclear and conventional take up the funds that could be devoted to economic development and social progress , which is of great importance to the people of developed and developing countries alike .  
Our national and regional security is best enhanced through the development of an international security system and through the removal of the threat to peace posed by weapons of mass destruction and the excessive accumulation of conventional weapons .  
Given that most of the conflicts on the Security Councils present agenda do not relate to conventional territorial disputes , but rather to ethnic reasons , religious intolerance , abject poverty , control over natural resources or systematic violations of human rights , an opportunity is created for the Economic and Social Council to cooperate with the Security Council through recommendations conducive to conflict prevention , an area which traditionally had seemed to be outside its sphere of competence .  
In order to address the question of interpretation and the applicable rules , a distinction must first be drawn between conventional acts and unilateral acts , from both the formal and material points of view , [ 104 ] since this will enable us to consider whether the Vienna rules can be transposed to the regime of unilateral acts , or give proper consideration to these rules , based on a flexible parallel approach .  
We firmly believe that the Final Document of the General Assemblys special session devoted to disarmament in 1978 rightly stated that the main priority should be granted to nuclear disarmament and weapons of mass destruction , and , afterward , conventional weapons .  
Applying transparency in the Middle East region to seven categories of conventional weapons while ignoring more advanced , more sophisticated or more lethal armaments , such as weapons of mass destruction and , in particular , nuclear weapons , is an approach that is neither balanced nor comprehensive .  
In implementing its interim programme , the Government thus faces a serious problem of external financing , which is essential in view of the countrys meagre domestic resources and the unresolved problem of its external debt arrears , which stands in the way of conventional official development assistance mechanisms .  
This strategy is designed to be consistent with existing treaties , protocols and resolutions relevant to mine action , including , but not limited to , the anti-personnel mine ban treaty , the Convention on certain conventional weapons and its Protocols , the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols of 1977 , the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the standard rules for the disabled . 6 The strategy is intended to assist Member States to fulfil their international obligations and to support the universalization of relevant international instruments . 
The widening gap in technological capabilities encompassed by the so-called revolution in military affairs and in the disparity of size of military budgets between the rich and the poor , the big and the smaller nations is increasing the imbalance in conventional force capabilities at the international and regional levels .
