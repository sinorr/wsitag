He said that Henan Province possessed not only the hardware required for foreign investment , but also integrated the reality of this province to formulate a preferential policy to encourage foreign investors to invest and develop foreign economic , trade and technological cooperation on the basis of national policies .  
Among them , natural gas companies in Sichuan and Chongqi regions have respectively signed with US companies such as Texaco , Enron , Mobil , etc . for risk exploration contracts in the Ya'an and Leshan areas ; contracts for improving recovery ratios in the central north of Sichuan , and feasibility joint research agreements on natural gas up and downstream integrated projects in the area of Wenhuangduo in east Sichuan .  
The funds raised by " Shenye Holding Company " this time will primarily be invested in developing intercity bus service , national car rental network , and in the existing real estate projects , to build up an integrated enterprise with Hong Kong as a base and Shenzhen as a business focus .  
the vanguard zones of the socialist market economic structure ; and the demonstration zones of sustainable development , which will take the lead in achieving modernization characterized by basically prosperous economy , optimum structure , perfect facilities , beautiful environment , integrated urban and rural areas , sound legal system , and civilized society .  
Along with the popularization and application of computer networks , the operation between different customs and between customs and relevant departments has been integrated into one .  So , customs and departments may exchange information through electronic records and may simultaneously read real information .  In this way , unlawful activities of cheating with false certificates will immediately be exposed .  
First , it is necessary to study and decide on building state-level strategic bases for knowledge innovations and carry out " extensive integrated reforms " across different institutions , different branches of learning , and different geographical areas in cities or areas with strong scientific and technological forces according to the needs in the state 's plan for developing the knowledge economy and high-tech industries .  Such bases should be used to foster and train high-level scientists and technologists and promote the development of high-tech industries .  
The most commendable thing about Xu Zhigong , who is both a theoretical worker and a high-ranking cadre , is that he " has made thoroughgoing studies , developed a firm faith in , and put into practice " Marxism in real terms .  He has all along maintained a highly developed sense of political responsibility and a firm ideological resolve that are required of a theoretical worker ; closely integrated scientific theories with the practice of reform and construction ;  
The department has carried out rectification and reform at a deeper level , strengthened investigation and study , closely integrated " looking back " with " looking forward , " thought of , discussed and grasped big things , paid greater attention to future work , and further enhanced its political sensitiveness and ability to distinguish political matters .  
As the majority of our products are of intermediate or low standard , we have had to import core key products from abroad ( such as CPU , DSP for mobile telecommunications , and so on ) .  Moreover , our country 's integrated circuits industry has also lagged far behind the international standard in terms of its seal and package technology .  
Learning and studying successful experiences of developed countries and neighboring regions in developing an integrated circuits industry and summing up our country 's experiences and lessons in developing an integrated circuits industry has become undoubtedly and extremely vital to our country 's development in future .  We should map out industrial policies ; build a development environment ;  
At present , China 's civilian networks are widely distributed , and the web sites and net points are scattering everywhere .  To enable these scattered strengths to really form an integrated joint force for attack and defense during the war , we must establish a highly authoritative , centralized and united network people 's war organizational organ .  
Over a long period of time , our military academies have integrated basic education with professional training .  As a result , our military academies have been vacillating between building a solid foundation for their students and meeting the need of students ' first job after their graduation .  This practice has made it difficult to enhance students ' quality and achieve economic performance of scale .  
From this , our army 's development , based on support , has proceeded only on a shrunken scale , weakening the military 's function in managing society ; the larger development trend has already gradually realized self-support capabilities integrated with socialized support .  
scientific , technological , and cultural quality ; and physical and mental quality .  All these also reflected an important trend in the implementation of the conference spirit by all units : The units closely integrated theory with practice , and always focused on major issues such as direction and strategy , so as to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work , and actively promote military modernization .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
The integrated system , which is composed of the direct-and-dispatch command , satellite - positioning , imagery-transmission , radio honeycomb communication , internal communication , display-and-control , and other sub-systems , and gave flexible and highly efficient direct-and-dispatch commands to and conducted whole-course monitoring and control on the units .  
After being formed into an armored infantry array , " Special Contribution Company No . 5 " equipped itself with new equipment , and its training content has also been changed from a unitary infantry profession into a comprehensive training which integrated armored training with communications and crew training .  
During integrated barrier-breaking drills on shores and beachheads , with the support of sea and aerial long-range striking firepower and with fire cover provided by new-type ship-borne air-defense missiles and anti-tank missiles , underwater and surface demolition teams serving ship-carried rocket vehicles , motor boats , high speed boats , and armored transport vehicles successively broke barriers by various means .  
This combat drill has not only expedited the conversion of achievements of scientific and technological troops training into combat strength , but it has also integrated individual achievements into a more solid system , and helped perfect initial achievements , expedite the application of theoretical achievements , and extensively popularize results of pilot projects .  In this way the combat drill has strongly promoted the development in breadth and depth of troops training through science and technology .  
During the Gulf War , with their indomitable information superiority and firepower superiority , the multinational force headed by the United States carried out integrated strikes of soft interference and suppression and hard , substantive destruction against Iraq that were compound , consecutive and highly intensive .  This opened people 's eyes to not only the " remnants " of mechanized war but also the new features of informationized war .  
The regiment successively built a comprehensive military tactics training ground which integrated the strategy of railway loading and unloading tactics , shooting with light weapons , and positional defense training , and a military officer training center with all functions , built a language teaching room and a simulation training room , introduced a simulation training system with electronic countermeasures and provided a good service guarantee and technical support for reforming the training methods and studying operational methods .  
In the meantime , our army 's telecommunications equipment has also grown from simulated telecommunications equipment into digital telecommunications equipment , from unitary-function telecommunications equipment into comprehensive telecommunications equipment , from varied telecommunications equipment into systematic telecommunications equipment , from separate telecommunications equipment for different arms systems into integrated telecommunications equipment for various arms systems , from stationary telecommunications equipment into mobile telecommunications equipment , from ground telecommunications equipment into underground ( underwater ) and air telecommunications equipment , and so on .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
After the end of the Korean War , northeast China integrated civil air defense building with urban capital construction , focused on organizing and starting civil air defense project building , which consisted mostly of building underground bomb shelters .  
A number of large and medium cities seized the opportunity of the rapid development of capital construction , quickly building new large and medium leading projects to make products for both peacetime and wartime use , and building underground bomb shelters integrated with civilian buildings , for a simultaneous growth of war readiness , social , and economic efficiency .  
Our alarms have an integrated notification order such as wired and wireless , radio and TV , and fixed and vehicle-mounted , with all national priority cities having achieved wholly or partially centralized control of the issuing function .  We have established a test alarm system that uses holidays and commemoration days , converting our air raid situation plotting form from manual to automatic computer operation .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
In guiding the scientific and technological military training of troop units , the Guangzhou Military Region has closely integrated learning new knowledge with studying and mastering new equipment , new skills and new tactics , incorporated them into specific technical and tactical subjects , and turn them into applied training courses which combine knowledge with skill .  In this way , it has had feasible training methods and appraisal criteria and made battlefield application of high-tech knowledge a required course which must be tested .  
People have paid increasingly greater attention to such a harsh reality : With the process of economic globalization gathering pace and the scope of opening to the outside world expanding , national boundaries have been broken by fierce market competition , and the two markets , domestic and international , are gradually integrated .  
This division proceeded from the reality of its capacity for anti-air-raids with existing equipment , and comprehensively deployed all kinds of radar and optical observation instruments it had to form a well-conceived antiaircraft reconnaissance system with multiple reconnaissance networks and an " integrated multi-network early warning " system , thus enabling " all units were informed about the information obtained by any unit . "  
[ Dai ] According to the major tasks and work plans set by our party and country for the new century , our initial plan is that the party 's external work at the beginning of the new century should become an important component of the integrated strategy of safeguarding the country 's comprehensive security , promoting its total democracy , and realizing a complete national reunification .  
Within a very short period of 20 years , Chinese economy made huge progress , the people 's living standards rose to a new height , and the integrated national strength made an enormous step forward .  
The emergence of key and difficult problems makes some new demands on the organizational structure , the internal division of effort , the means and methods , and the scope of application of ideological and political work , and in the mutual relationships among these things .  How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
Lin Chong-pin stated : Beijing 's Taiwan policy has been obviously integrated with its strategy , and the basic framework of this policy has not changed and remains to be the " one country , two systems " and " peaceful reunification . "  In the tactical aspect , however , Beijing has constantly readjusted the forms of this policy .  Since July 1999 , Beijing has applied four operational tactics toward Taiwan .  
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
Upholding the four cardinal principles and persisting in reform and opening up are closely integrated and mutually stimulating , and they can not be separated or set against each other ; we must unify into the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics the combination of regarding economic construction as the central task with the four cardinal principles and with reform and opening up .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
What integrated strategic operations basically means is the overall , multidimensional use in the air , ground , sea , space , and electromagnetic realms of the information warfare capabilities , long-range precision strike capabilities , and mobility of integrated units , creating a decisive posture involving complete space-time control of the battlefield and focused directly at the enemy 's center of gravity .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
The " Plan and Program " points out that by the year 2010 , the whole Army will establish an integrated auditing system in keeping with the joint logistics guarantee system and equipment guarantee system .  The auditing duties and functions will be explicitly defined .  The supervisory mechanisms will be set to work effectively .  The auditing regulations will be improved according to the requirements of military economic reforms .  
In the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , marked results were achieved in the archive work of our army : In the whole army , an integrated military archive system with full categories , reasonable structure , scientific management , good facilities , and efficient services was set up basically .  Corresponding rules and regulations for archive building and management were also formulated and improved .  A batch of high-quality archive management software was developed .  
Deputy Chief of General Staff Wu Quanxu , who instructed the drill , claimed that to protect the people 's personal and property safety and to minimize the loss from the possible nuclear accidents , the PLA has established and perfected the rescue and commanding system , whereby the servicemen are combined with the people , the peacetime need is combined with the wartime need , and the three armed services are integrated , and has already possessed the capabilities of providing rapid rescue to all sorts of nuclear accidents .  
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
During his inspection tour , Wu Bangguo expressed admiration for the way Shanghai implemented the " 3-2-1 " industrial development policy and organically integrated the urban layout readjustment and its functional improvement with the industrial readjustment in accordance with the plan for economic and social development and the general urban plan .  
What stable supply and maintenance support links refers to is the integrated use of various support means , with pre-combat support deployment serving as the base , to form a multidimensional logistical support network for the entire in-depth joint combat battlefield , including supply and support links in which the replenishment of ammunition is a key point , technical support links in which the maintenance of new and high-tech equipment is a key point , and knowledge support links in which troops with special skills are the key points .  
The " Russian Weapons and Equipment Development Plan for 2010 " , approved by President Putin early this year , has specifically defined the direction of priority development of weapons and equipment for the Russian military .  The Russian military will adhere to the general principle of " reducing quantity and increasing quality " in the development of weapons .  It will give priority to developing integrated weapon systems with higher capabilities and greater precision that combine reconnaissance , forewarning , command , positioning , attack , and communications .  
He pointed out that the fundamental reason why the CPC has been able during its 80-year career to unite and lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to win victory after victory and overcome one danger and obstacle after another is that we have consistently integrated the basic principles of Marxism with China 's specific reality , and have continually explored and upheld the correct road for advance suited to China 's realities in every historical period of revolution , construction , and reform .  
Therefore , our party is required to deeply understand and acutely grasp the requirement for developing China 's advanced productive forces , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the direction for the advancement of China 's advanced culture , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people in China , to treat the three as an integrated whole , and to genuinely , effectively , and systematically represent them through a set of correct of line , principles , and policies and effective forms .  
The " Speech " has integrated theory with practice , and the ideal with reality ; and has expounded the dialectical relations between the maximum program and the minimum program of the party .  While unfolding before us the bright future of a communist society , he has also stressed that the realization of communism is a very long historical process of struggle , and has urged the whole party to devote continued efforts to a successful fulfillment of both the basic program and the historical tasks of the party at the present stage .  
Being an integrated concept , " three represents " has a distinguished advanced feature , and embodies a scientific spirit of innovation , a broad worldwide vision , a firm principle for the development of the party .  This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
Following the reform , the Navy will be reorganized into 8-10 integrated fleets , with each fleet equipped with one nuclear-powered submarine , 8-10 conventional modified submarines , two missile destroyers , 6-8 frigates and missile gunboats , and four auxiliary vessels .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
The most distinctive characteristic of socialized labor wherein large-scale production differentiates itself from individualized labor engaged in small-scale production lies in the close interrelationship between each of the procedures and links in production , and the fact that laborers are integrated into an inseparable , indivisible whole in the production process .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
We must actively support the development of agricultural product processing industries , taking a path of integrated trade , industrial , and agricultural industrialization .  We must bolster qualified enterprises in their development of agricultural production , processing , and export bases , enhancing the motivating power on farmers by the market competition forces , and raising the level of agricultural production organization and the international competitive power of China 's agriculture .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
The army is trying to raise its field air defense and mobile assault capability , the navy is forming a combat equipment system for sea-borne mobile and land-based defense of coastal waters , and the air force is forming a system that will be equipped for both attack and defense , a high - , medium - , and low-altitude , long - , medium - , and short-range integrated system of disposition combined with an antiaircraft intelligence network that can defend our national territory .  
In line with the overall plan of building three trans-regional integrated power grids in the northern , central and southern parts of China , during the " 10th Five-Year " plan period and based on the trans-regional power supply and integrated power grid project construction plan , we will build 2,500 kilometers of alternating current lines and 4,345 kilometers of direct current lines of 500 kilovolts .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
The integrated logistics support system 's overall function of coordination , highly efficient sectional function , and powerful regulatory function can make the entire system and all of the various sub-systems train their focus on the objective of support , playing a sustained and highly efficient role to ensure the best result of integration .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
With the pace of opening to the outside world further accelerated , China 's economy will merge into the world economy in a still positive attitude , and the domestic market will be integrated with the international market with each passing day , which will contribute to better utilizing the domestic and foreign resources and provide economic growth with even greater room for maneuver .

We should , laying stress on youngsters and " high-risk groups , " go down to universities as well as middle and primary schools ; to public security lockups , reeducation-through-labor centers , detention centers , and rehabilitation centers ; and to residential districts , rural areas , enterprises , and public institutions to properly conduct preventive education on narcotics through various integrated measures to make every family and individual aware of the matter .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .

During this period , it was the " spring of science , " in which science and technology , as the primary productive forces , were more and more closely integrated with the economic construction .  In particular , with the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and technology being defined as the basic national policy , acceleration of scientific and technological progress was placed in an important position of economic and social development .  
Due to the limitations of the country 's structure and mechanisms , the problem of regional barriers and departmental protectionism does exist , to a certain extent , with the use of the country 's urban cultural resources ; and there is no an authoritative and integrated leading organ to exercise an effective management , and there lacks an overall planning in its real sense .  
Starting with reform of the structure , mechanism , and system and taking into account the deeper-level factors that produce negative phenomenon and corruption , the " Implementation Methods " drawn up by various departments ( units ) , have closely integrated with reality , identified crucial issues , defined the focus of the work of fighting corruption by grasping at the source at present and in the next few years , and put forward practicable measures and methods .  
For this reason , the important objective of this year 's economic and trade plans should be supporting the development of high and new technology industries , represented by electronics and information technology industries , and at the same time using high and new technology and advanced applicable technology to upgrade the traditional industry so that information infrastructure and industrialization can be integrated and can promote each other to achieve common development .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
Effectively stopping channels for the infiltrative influence of various wrong ideas , enlivening the cultural life in the barracks , and creating a positive and progressive ideological and political environment .

Students with moderate to profound hearing impairment and having acquired sufficient language skills are integrated in ordinary classes .  Inspectors of ED visit schools regularly to advise teachers and social workers on how best to support these students .  
For the delivery of health care service , we shall strengthen preventive care , re-organise primary medical care , develop a community-focused , patient centred and knowledge based integrated health care service , and improve public / private interface .  
In 1962 , the City Hall Art Gallery and Museum was established in the Hong Kong City Hall , marking a rejuvenation of modern museum services in the territory .  Since then , the museum services have developed and expanded progressively with museums of different themes set up one by one , forming an integrated network in preserving local history , art and cultural heritage .  
The Council coordinates our technological development and explores ways to capitalize on innovation and technology in enhancing economic growth .  It has examined our advantages in respect to tertiary education , scientific research , commerce and industry , infrastructure , etc . and the global prospects on the technological front .  Four niches which Hong Kong has the potential and strength to excel were identified , namely biomedical research , integrated chips design , nanotechnology and service automation .  
In the coming years , our elderly services will aim at providing better support to elders in need and co-ordinating community and institutional care services .  For example , public rental estates with a high concentration of older people will be provided with integrated care services .  We will also organise more intergenerational activities in communities to help our elders enjoy healthy and active ageing .  
Also included among the many events being staged across London are exhibitions of photography depicting the brilliant skyline and ground-level developments ; contemporary Chinese ink paintings reflecting traditional techniques in its versatility ; and an architectural exhibition examining the way architecture , communications and the economy integrated to make Hong Kong Asia 's world city .  
Noting that the existing outline zoning plan ( OZP ) for the site envisages several commercial and residential lots for piecemeal development as well as open space and land for Government facilities and roads , the spokesman said the existing zoning is incompatible with the concept of inviting proposals from the private sector for a fully integrated development mixing cultural and commercial facilities and other diverse uses . 
Thus , subjects of academic , practical , vocational and integrated nature will be included in the curriculum to meet the different personal and vocational needs of students as well as the social , economic and technological demands of Hong Kong 's development .  
Thus , the three major government planning departments should use an integrated method for a long-term plan and not only use economic planning to cope with future social change . Only then can there be a " social miracle " to create a true People 's Livelihood " welfare state . " ( 2 ) A planning law should be established and interchange between planning personnel and line agencies strengthened .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
Science and the fruits of science will be harmoniously integrated with human life . The modernity and completeness of its public facilities will actively promote a well-rounded existence which is pluralistic in both inspiration and application . The result will not only enhance our international image , but it will also turn us into a model of what modern living should be like . .  
These plans were produced by first of all bringing together a group of top-notch scientists , who would perform deep investigations , hold discussions and perform analysis and research before collectively coming up with worldwide development trends . Then related industrial departments would be mobilized to describe their scientific development needs . Finally , in accordance with the special strengths of Chinese research personnel , the three aspects would be integrated , and a most beneficial development plan would be proposed .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
In the advisory report issued in 1998 by the Executive Yuan 's Education Reform Committee , there is no sign of the words " integrated curriculum . " However , the committee members agreed that existing subject divisions were too narrow , and that children mostly studied fragmentary , disjointed knowledge completely divorced from their life experience . Thus " course integration " was an obvious orientation for change .  
However , an even greater breakthrough is the way the integrated curriculum redefines the " textbook . " In future both the approved textbooks now used in elementary schools , and the standard textbooks used in junior high , may be relegated from their leading classroom role to a supporting role , for " diverse teaching materials " and " school-developed courses " are another big change introduced by the new curriculum .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
Lu Hsiu-na , head of the social studies textbook group at KST , reports : " Everyone at KST is busy compiling textbooks for the fourth and seventh grades to support the integrated curriculum schedule . We have to leave third , fifth , and sixth grade textbooks for later . " In Lu 's opinion , learning is a process of cognitive development , and textbooks ought to be compiled sequentially , tracing the path of that development .  
From the very start , Yung'an has served as an experimental school for the nine-year integrated curriculum . Taiwan 's textbook publishers are now hard at work compiling textbooks for the integrated curriculum , but they have only finished with the first grade so far . The teachers at Yung'an , however , started working long ago to create an integrated curriculum of their own . Using existing textbooks as reference , they have already developed several integrated textbooks for the second and third grades .  
" The approach adopted now at chinatimes.com is to integrate a number of e-papers and mail these out to members . Although no fees are collected from members , the profit lies in the hidden vertical-depth e-commerce represented by each member , " says Michael Chang , chief operations officer . By working with businesses , treating the e-paper platform as a giant shopping center , and using integrated operations , not only can a news-oriented e-paper survive , its professional reputation can be a guarantee of reliability to consumers .  
Fortunately , when the integrated nine-year curriculum goes into effect , there will be more time devoted to sex education in junior high and elementary school classrooms . The education will provide the kids with a more complete understanding of sexual issues , including discussions about ethics , behavioral changes , and self-protection . These classes are not just going to focus on sensationalistic aspects of sex .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago . Although it reduced ten subjects to seven major disciplines , the core subjects of mathematics , Chinese and English remained clearly delineated in the classroom .  
Teachers are also very concerned about the possibility of lowered academic competence on the part of their students , given the fact that the increasingly diversified subject matter of the new integrated curriculum takes away from time spent on basic subjects .  
Chou takes the nine-year integrated curriculum as an example . Neither the idea of a system integrating the content to be studied in Grades 1-9 , nor that of academic " fields , " are new . In fact , these things had been spelled out in previous curricular standards . In past decades , however , one saw the prevalent use of " contracting out " specialized tasks within Taiwan 's education system , so much so that now that things have been opened up , people can not imagine doing otherwise .  
" This type of flexible class would have been impossible before the nine-year integrated curriculum , " says Li . Of course , she also does as is required and teaches three formal biology classes . While these classes may be rigid , she says , they must be attended to , since " if test scores are n't good , students will feel frustrated , and parents will protest . "  
the settlement of the question of population must always be closely integrated with the promotion of all round social and economic development for developing countries , the primary task is to eliminate poverty , improve education , health care , living conditions , enhance women 's status and strengthen environmental protection  
They should be addressed in a balanced and integrated manner and protected and promoted with due regard for specific cultural , social , economic and political circumstances .  
With its limited financial and human resources , it is trying to control the problem at the national level , and to contribute at a regional and international level in an integrated and comprehensive manner .  
Hence , it can not be solved by isolated and fragmented strategies but must be addressed in a coordinated , comprehensive and integrated way , employing resources at all levels of the national and international community .  
Governments were requested to rationalize urban growth and improve the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of integrated rural development programmes with economic , social and environmental dimensions .  
The development of an integrated mining system that would be operational in an actual deep seabed environment on a sustained basis is demanding both in terms of time and effort and requires substantial financial inputs .  
The Fund also supported a wide range of activities to further integrate family planning into primary healthcare networks , improve the quality of existing services and extend integrated MCH / FP services to poor and remote areas .  
It bases its findings on the emergence of new strategies and structures at the firm level which , in the aggregate , suggest that a more integrated international production system is emerging and may influence the future pattern of global economic relations .  
We recognize that all human rights , including the right to development , are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that as such are of equal importance and should be addressed in a balanced and integrated manner .  
Such efforts should bring together those responsible for economic , financial and social policy and provide an integrated framework for guiding national and international policies aimed at meeting the current challenges of the world economy .  
The Assembly should focus on the development of norms , standards and rules of the game required to manage global interdependence in a rapidly changing international environment and promote an integrated approach to economic and social development .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Let us suppose , then , that the world of the future will have to be shaped according to regions , or large integrated groups or communities , regional or otherwise , that have a common cultural origin and wish to be identified with the others , because of the particular characteristics of their culture , such as tradition , language , religion and even mixed blood . 
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
When the founding fathers of the 1945 Charter forged close structural links between the Court and the United Nations , they obviously intended that the Court should be fully integrated into the new system for the peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been devised , but they did not in any way wish to deprive the Court of the autonomy indispensable to the sound administration of justice .  
The globalization of socio-economic activities calls for an integrated and universal approach , for if the development of the world economy is not accompanied by regulations and corrective mechanisms , it runs the risk of increasing destabilization and of breeding social and ecological imbalances . 
Jamaica 's national youth policy was therefore designed to redress all these deficiencies , but first of all to bring an integrated approach to the activities of youth organizations nation wide and to equip all youth with the necessary academic , technical and life-coping skills to foster their personal development .  
As is recalled in resolution 48 / 162 , the General Assembly is the main forum where Governments pursue the development dialogue in a political context , oriented towards taking an integrated view of matters pertaining to the economic , social and related fields in order to build and deepen the political understanding required for enhanced international development cooperation . 
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Here I would like to echo the proposal made by President Ben Ali , Chairman of the OAU last year , for a global economic and social plan aimed at ensuring the development of Africa on a sound and lasting basis , helping our continent overcome its shortcomings and become integrated into the world economy and ensuring dignified conditions of life for all the peoples of the continent .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .  
Nationally determined policies for integrated and multifaceted programmes , with special attention to women , to the poorest people living in critical areas and to other vulnerable groups should be implemented , ensuring the involvement of groups with a special potential to act as agents for change and sustainable development .  
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .  
Stressing also that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance provided in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking humanitarian assistance with economic aid for national reconstruction and development ,  
Aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace in Central America , and bearing in mind that the Central American Integration System constitutes the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development can be promoted in an effective , orderly and coherent manner ,  
At the international level priority should be given to the development of a holistic and integrated framework to put in place social and economic conditions which will facilitate optimum matching of land resources with needs , in terms of production , sustainability , and conservation of biodiversity , together with the necessary technical and infrastructural support , which can be applied in any country with appropriate modifications , according to local needs and conditions .  Proposal 2 .  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
At the Paris ceremony , AfDB committed itself to play an active part in implementing the Convention , in line with the important role assigned to it under the provisions of the Convention , particularly in terms of integrated activities in key areas such as improving national economic environments , the sustainable use of natural resources , efficient energy use , capacity-building and sensitization .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
As in previous thematic discussions , there was recognition of the urgent importance of gathering information and gender-disaggregated data , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels , with a view to assessing the prevailing reality affecting girls , identifying persisting problems and challenging the prevalence of invisibility , which in turn allows for the perpetuation of vulnerability .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
Aware that the voluntary repatriation of large numbers of Somali refugees in neighbouring countries and elsewhere , as well as the return of internally displaced persons to their original homes , will still require a planned and integrated international assistance programme designed to cover their basic needs , ensure adequate reception arrangements and facilitate their smooth integration into their respective communities ,  
The three political , military or humanitarian functions can be carried out in integrated and unified operations , provided that there are clearly established modalities of cooperation , including information sharing , transparency , joint planning and logistics ;  
To facilitate their effective implementation , it may be necessary to assemble , with full participation of all concerned entities of the United Nations system , all the pieces in a single , integrated operational framework with clear-cut priorities , time-bound targets in line with those set by the World Summit for Social Development in the most crucial areas , and well-defined responsibilities for national and international efforts .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
The purpose of integrated plans and strategies is to develop a consensual vision for the future and to identify common priority issues and key activities within a framework that provides for consensus-building and planning and the creation of the institutional support required for sustainable development .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based upon sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
As stated in the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Seminar ( A / AC . 109 / 1107 ) , its primary objective was to review economic and social conditions in the Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean region and identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in programmes of assistance and development and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the viable and sustainable development of the Territories concerned .  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
The subprogramme , in collaboration with United Nations organizations and international and national research institutions , aims at promoting the further development and application integrated environmental and economic analysis instruments , as well as national , regional and international programmes and policies for sound environmental management and sustainable development .  
The programme comprises four interrelated and mutually supportive functions : ( a ) developing statistical concepts and methods for use by Member States ; ( b ) collecting , processing and disseminating integrated statistics ; ( c ) promoting the coordination of international statistical activities ; and ( d ) supporting technical cooperation in statistics and statistical data processing , including informatics .  
These activities include basic statistical and methodological work in national accounts , international merchandise trade , commodity production , energy , population and human settlements , the environment , prices , the role of women , social indicators and special population groups , and general integrated databases .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
The Commission noted the importance of developing , among the organizations of the United Nations system , a common or compatible system of access to their respective databases , in order to share data fully , to streamline the collection and interpretation of data and to identify data gaps , for the purpose of providing more comprehensive and integrated data to decision makers at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .  
For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
Particularly in recommendation 9 , it has stressed the urgent need to gather data and disaggregated information on a gender basis , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels with a view to assessing the current reality of women , identifying persistent problems and challenging the invisibility of women 's human rights .  
" human resources development is a broad concept . . . requiring integrated and concerted strategies , policies , plans and programmes to ensure the development of the full potential of human beings . . . so that they may , individually and collectively , be capable of improving their standard of living " .  
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
It was agreed that the forging of an integrated United Nations system approach in post-conflict situations could be greatly assisted by the development of a strategic framework combining political , humanitarian , economic and social areas of intervention .  
Those results will then need to be integrated into a clear set of conclusions and policy recommendations for advancing international understanding and consensus on forest issues : on that basis , the Panel is expected to propose coherent approaches to addressing the problem of the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests .  
Through its normative and field programmes at the global , regional , national and local levels in assessment and monitoring of land resources , policy and planning assistance , development and transfer of technologies , capacity building and demonstration in agriculture , livestock , forestry , fisheries and rural development .  FAO continues to contribute actively to desertification control , drought preparedness and mitigation and integrated dry land development in affected countries .  
The feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national crime prevention and criminal justice legislation and its implementation was to be determined , with a view to encouraging appropriate alignment in international cooperation through such means as extradition and other modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Department staff held meetings with the senior representatives of the League to discuss joint actions to organize a regional seminar on a new integrated approach for sustainable human development : spatial / sectoral development strategy for Arab countries .  
In his report on the mission he undertook to the United States of America ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 78 / Add . 1 ) , " The Special Rapporteur found sociological inertia , structural obstacles and individual resistance hindering the emergence of an integrated society based on the equal dignity of the members of the American nation and willing to accept ethnic and cultural pluralism " ( para .  NULL  
In addition , it promotes assessment , integrated development and management of water resources ; and addresses the need for planned mineral resources exploration and development and responsible land use , through training , exchange of information , technical advice and the strengthening of relevant national and regional institutions .  
In the end , the design concept involved the elements of a vertical city in the park ( a tall rectangular slab ) and an integrated civic centre ( composed of the slab , a low General Assembly building and a horizontal link , the Conference building ) .  
The Commission for Social Development would play a central role , in particular from the perspective of social integration ; the Secretariat would report to the Council on the activities and findings of other relevant functional commissions ; in deciding , the year before , on the contents of its review the Council would take into account the related choice of theme ( s ) for the integrated consideration of the follow-up of major conferences .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
At the level of the United Nations and its agencies , the strengthening of the capacity of the system to support an integrated , effective follow-up to the Fourth World Conference as part of the overall effort to ensure the coordinated implementation of the results of the series of recent global conferences should be a key objective in pursuing further the ongoing reform process .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .  
that connection , her delegation supported the new multi-dimensional international strategy adopted by the General Assembly in 1993 which was based on a balanced effort to reduce supply and demand and on the promotion of comprehensive national drug control plans integrated in economic and social planning .  
Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
The Agenda for Development will be of no practical value to the developing countries if it limits itself to an analysis of the world economic outlook while failing to put forward specific action-oriented measures for implementation in an integrated and coordinated manner .  
In order to effect such an integrated scheme of cooperation along the lines I have just outlined , my delegation believes that the institution of inter-agency task forces , as established by the Administrative Committee on Coordination , can be a major channel through which participating agencies can engage in constructive dialogue for the purpose of ensuring close cooperation in effectively implementing the Programme of Action . Intensified efforts for coordination and cooperation are very much desired .

We also urge that an integrated initiative be agreed upon at that meeting on providing the least developed countries with coordinated and substantially increased technical cooperation in trade and trade-related areas with a view to strengthening their supply capacity of exportable goods and services , in line with the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on Measures in Favour of the Least Developed Countries .  
In this connection , we express our appreciation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development for his initiative , in cooperation and coordination with the relevant international organizations , to assist the least developed countries to formulate integrated country programmes for strengthening the supply capacity of exportable goods and services , pursuant to the relevant decision of the Trade and Development Board at its annual session last year .  
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
The integrated global system that has been established for the monitoring and warning of hydrometeorlogical hazards through the coordinated activities of national services is dependent on the free and unrestricted exchange of data and the communication of information .

A typical user terminal , operating at an uplink bit rate of between 128 and 768 Kbps , would employ a small-aperture antenna with a diameter of 66 cm and a solid-state power amplifier ( SSPA ) of 1-3 W . All radio frequency components ( SSPA , low noise amplifier , and up / down-converters ) would be integrated into a small outdoor unit mounted on the reflector . 
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
In order to put an end to this distressing situation , Africa 's development partners should envisage a comprehensive and integrated mechanism for flexible , operational and effective financing , free of bureaucratic impediments and red tape , with the aim of establishing a centralized funding entity to receive resources from all sources to be devoted to economic and social development .  
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .

It is also natural for Algeria to plead for a global and integrated approach to the security and development of the Mediterranean , convinced as it is that there can be no genuine security for all as long as serious and intolerable imbalances persist between the northern and southern shores of the Mediterranean .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
Globalization refers to the integrated cross-border organization of economic activity , led by transnational economic actors , including transnational corporations from both developed and developing countries and institutional investors , achieved by the rapid expansion of international trade , capital flows and technology transfers , and facilitated by the revolutions in telecommunications and information technology .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in East and South-East Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .

If undertaken on the basis of an integrated and participatory approach - with the Governments as the formulators and enforcers of economic and legal policies , non-governmental organizations and the scientific community as the environmental agencies that know the most about the resilience and carrying capacity of the Earth , and the private sector as the prime mover for technological development , transfer and diffusion - TNAs can contribute to policy integration by making both public and private decision makers more aware of the environmental consequences of their actions .  
The authorities of the National Committee for Aid to Refugees , Returnees and Displaced Persons ( CEAR ) have said that the working strategies in the area concerned the management of the process of return : consolidation of reintegration ; land-use planning in conjunction with agro _ ecological studies and definition of the population base ; consolidation of return : socio _ economic reintegration process to promote integrated community development , legal security of land , legal and moral responsibility in paying for property , and planning strategies .  
Participating States agreed that effective development and implementation of national programmes of action should focus on sustainable , pragmatic and integrated environmental management , harmonized , as appropriate , with ocean basin management and land-use plans .  
Those trends are reflective of the deepening economic ties between developed and developing countries , and of the growing importance of integrated international production networks , which hold the promise of contributing to environmental objectives insofar as the integration of economies through such networks encourages the transfer and harmonization of environmentally friendly technologies across borders .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;

Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
Many lack the capacity to articulate a long-term vision , an integrated policy framework and coherent programming or lack the capacity for policy reconciliation between sustained economic growth and sustainable development or between structural adjustment and social stability .  
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .

Although the world economy was becoming more integrated through trade and other financial flows , and offers mutual benefits and growing opportunities for economic expansion to participating countries , it also generated social dislocation and demands difficult policy adjustments .  
Reaffirms the Declaration on the Right to Development , as proclaimed by the General Assembly in resolution 41 / 128 of 4 December 1986 , where stress is laid on the multidimensional , integrated and dynamic character of this right which promotes partnership for development and constitutes a relevant framework for international cooperation and national action aimed at universal and effective observance of all human rights in their universality , indivisibility and interdependence ;  
The General Assembly has recognized the importance of the collaboration of IOM in those activities by inviting it to participate on a regular basis in the Inter-Agency Standing Committee , a group responsible for the formulation of system-wide humanitarian policy and for ensuring that complex emergencies are dealt with through an integrated strategic approach . 
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
The States of the Rio Group had reaffirmed that an integrated strategy to combat drugs should take into account the social and economic aspects of the phenomenon ; it was thus essential to implement social and regional development and substitution programmes designed to improve the living conditions of the rural families concerned . 
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .

Our interdependence is increasing through international legally binding commitments , the adoption of policies reaching across national borders , enhanced trade and financial flows , and markets which have become fully integrated on a global scale .  
Another area of greatest need is the development of small satellite technology , which has strong potential for offering a larger number of countries affordable access to space through the rapid development of fully integrated national space programmes .  
An integrated approach to the efficient and equitable development and allocation of water resources requires the use of economic and regulatory instruments designed to maximize social net benefits .  
Thanks to that integrated approach , the vast national programmes and the regional and international cooperation existing among the members of ASEAN , the peoples of the region had seen a considerable improvement in their quality of life .  
A comprehensive , integrated yet flexible approach is required in order to explore the developmental opportunities of ageing , as they combine with the technological and cultural transitions of our time .

In the Caribbean , in collaboration with selected regional institutions , OAS is currently providing technical assistance for the execution of three major projects : assessment of coastal and marine problems ; assessment of the current state of effluent disposal in the region ; and comprehensive review of integrated coastal zone management legislative systems .  
Since sectoral approaches to coastal development have not proven effective in arresting its deterioration , the concept of integrated coastal area management ( ICAM ) has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive , ecosystem-based approach to sustainable development and environmental conservation .  
To be most effective in achieving sustainable forest management , economic instruments should be designed with a specific policy objective in mind ; they should also be well integrated into the broader macroeconomic and multisectoral policy context .  
Such issues as trade , market access and transparency , and economic , environmental and social policies which directly or indirectly affect the forest sector , as well as governance and corruption , private investment , financial resources and transfer of technology , need to be addressed in an integrated manner to achieve efficiency and effective results .

Discussions of land management at the eighth session might focus on the integrated management and planning of agricultural and non-agricultural land , including forests , watersheds , protected eco-systems and settlements , so as to meet the growing needs of rural and urban populations for food , water and forest products , while protecting essential ecosystems and ecological services .  
As stressed by the Harare expert group , integrated water resource management is therefore essential for integrating and reconciling interests in the river basin whether national or international with regard to water quality , quantity and the aquatic ecosystems .  
At the national level , this entails improving regulatory mechanisms and legislative frameworks , medium - and long-term integrated planning and strategy development , the use of economic instruments for sustainable consumption and production patterns and general awareness-raising and educational activities relating to sustainable development .  
Enhanced national capacity for integrating environmental considerations into economic and social policies ; improvement of energy efficiency and conservation potentials ; wider application of renewable energy technologies ; formulation and implementation of integrated development and management policies in the water , mineral and marine resources sectors ; natural disaster preparedness and mitigation ; and application of space technology through human resources development activities ;

The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
Preliminary reviews of the 1998 resident coordinator annual reports and UNDAF pilot exercises shows that thematic groups work more effectively when linked to or the result of combined efforts of major / key stakeholders to develop a framework for a coordinated and integrated country-level response to cross-cutting themes derived from major international conferences .  
The work of the various thematic groups , organized around specific cross-cutting themes emerging from the international programmes , should now be further integrated to ensure a more comprehensive approach to conference follow-up , facilitating the development of a corresponding integrated follow-up at the national level .  
In particular , the introduction and implementation of common country assessments and UNDAFs , by providing a framework for a consistent and coordinated interaction among national priorities and international objectives as identified by global conferences and possible United Nations system response , is expected to contribute to more integrated United Nations system support for conference follow-up and to redefine and enhance the work of thematic groups accordingly .

How to draw new boundaries and achieve new standardization of these things , and make them form up an integrated whole which is full of vitality , is an important aspect of strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new situation .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
The process of economic globalization is speeding up and has been breaking up the barriers that hinder the movement of capital , technology , information , and labor force across national boundaries .  This process is also turning the world economy into an integrated entity , making the international division of work and international cooperation closer , providing conditions for various nations to more extensively participate in international competition , and also bringing about rare opportunities for the economic and cultural developments in developing countries .  
We must uphold the policy of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , use various macro-control means in an integrated manner , and strengthen and develop the excellent economic growth situation .  
However , we are also faced with an unreasonable economic structure , which is conspicuously seen in the unreasonable production structure , imbalance between different regions in the degree of economic development , low urbanization standards , poor integrated quality of the national economy , and lack of international competition power .  
Lin Chong-pin stated : Beijing 's Taiwan policy has been obviously integrated with its strategy , and the basic framework of this policy has not changed and remains to be the " one country , two systems " and " peaceful reunification . "  In the tactical aspect , however , Beijing has constantly readjusted the forms of this policy .  Since July 1999 , Beijing has applied four operational tactics toward Taiwan .  
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
Upholding the four cardinal principles and persisting in reform and opening up are closely integrated and mutually stimulating , and they can not be separated or set against each other ; we must unify into the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics the combination of regarding economic construction as the central task with the four cardinal principles and with reform and opening up .  
As the foremost principle in joint operations , " unified action " requires that all actions be focused on achieving a common goal .  At the national level it requires the integrated use of political , diplomatic , economic , intelligence , and military power to achieve the strategic goals of the state , as well as specific strategic goals which result from that .  
What integrated strategic operations basically means is the overall , multidimensional use in the air , ground , sea , space , and electromagnetic realms of the information warfare capabilities , long-range precision strike capabilities , and mobility of integrated units , creating a decisive posture involving complete space-time control of the battlefield and focused directly at the enemy 's center of gravity .  
If this posture is insufficient to achieve the strategic scheme , then full-dimensional protection will be used to keep one 's own losses to an absolute minimum , maintaining military action freedom and , at the same time , bringing to bear the operational might of integrated C4ISR systems and strike systems to carry out controlled strikes against the enemy 's center of gravity to achieve a decisive victory quickly .  
The " Plan and Program " points out that by the year 2010 , the whole Army will establish an integrated auditing system in keeping with the joint logistics guarantee system and equipment guarantee system .  The auditing duties and functions will be explicitly defined .  The supervisory mechanisms will be set to work effectively .  The auditing regulations will be improved according to the requirements of military economic reforms .  
In the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , marked results were achieved in the archive work of our army : In the whole army , an integrated military archive system with full categories , reasonable structure , scientific management , good facilities , and efficient services was set up basically .  Corresponding rules and regulations for archive building and management were also formulated and improved .  A batch of high-quality archive management software was developed .  
Deputy Chief of General Staff Wu Quanxu , who instructed the drill , claimed that to protect the people 's personal and property safety and to minimize the loss from the possible nuclear accidents , the PLA has established and perfected the rescue and commanding system , whereby the servicemen are combined with the people , the peacetime need is combined with the wartime need , and the three armed services are integrated , and has already possessed the capabilities of providing rapid rescue to all sorts of nuclear accidents .  
After the European Union began to function as an integrated regional economic entity , and after the United States pursued trade policies to strengthen the Free Trade Area of the Americas , a new , noteworthy trend has emerged in the Asia-Pacific region since last year , with bilateral and small multilateral interaction in the region taking the place of economic globalization as a primary phenomenon in the Asian-Pacific region .  In some countries and regions , there has been a great upsurge in signing bilateral and small multilateral free trade agreements .  
During his inspection tour , Wu Bangguo expressed admiration for the way Shanghai implemented the " 3-2-1 " industrial development policy and organically integrated the urban layout readjustment and its functional improvement with the industrial readjustment in accordance with the plan for economic and social development and the general urban plan .  
What stable supply and maintenance support links refers to is the integrated use of various support means , with pre-combat support deployment serving as the base , to form a multidimensional logistical support network for the entire in-depth joint combat battlefield , including supply and support links in which the replenishment of ammunition is a key point , technical support links in which the maintenance of new and high-tech equipment is a key point , and knowledge support links in which troops with special skills are the key points .  
The " Russian Weapons and Equipment Development Plan for 2010 " , approved by President Putin early this year , has specifically defined the direction of priority development of weapons and equipment for the Russian military .  The Russian military will adhere to the general principle of " reducing quantity and increasing quality " in the development of weapons .  It will give priority to developing integrated weapon systems with higher capabilities and greater precision that combine reconnaissance , forewarning , command , positioning , attack , and communications .  
He pointed out that the fundamental reason why the CPC has been able during its 80-year career to unite and lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to win victory after victory and overcome one danger and obstacle after another is that we have consistently integrated the basic principles of Marxism with China 's specific reality , and have continually explored and upheld the correct road for advance suited to China 's realities in every historical period of revolution , construction , and reform .  
Therefore , our party is required to deeply understand and acutely grasp the requirement for developing China 's advanced productive forces , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the direction for the advancement of China 's advanced culture , to deeply understand and acutely grasp the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people in China , to treat the three as an integrated whole , and to genuinely , effectively , and systematically represent them through a set of correct of line , principles , and policies and effective forms .  
The " Speech " has integrated theory with practice , and the ideal with reality ; and has expounded the dialectical relations between the maximum program and the minimum program of the party .  While unfolding before us the bright future of a communist society , he has also stressed that the realization of communism is a very long historical process of struggle , and has urged the whole party to devote continued efforts to a successful fulfillment of both the basic program and the historical tasks of the party at the present stage .  
Being an integrated concept , " three represents " has a distinguished advanced feature , and embodies a scientific spirit of innovation , a broad worldwide vision , a firm principle for the development of the party .  This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
Following the reform , the Navy will be reorganized into 8-10 integrated fleets , with each fleet equipped with one nuclear-powered submarine , 8-10 conventional modified submarines , two missile destroyers , 6-8 frigates and missile gunboats , and four auxiliary vessels .  
In the course of leading the whole party and the people of the entire country to continuously advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics , the party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , has persistently integrated the basic tenets of Marxism with the practice of the modernization drive in the contemporary China and has constantly deepened the understanding of party building of the ruling party and the law governing the socialist modernization drive .  
The most distinctive characteristic of socialized labor wherein large-scale production differentiates itself from individualized labor engaged in small-scale production lies in the close interrelationship between each of the procedures and links in production , and the fact that laborers are integrated into an inseparable , indivisible whole in the production process .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
We must actively support the development of agricultural product processing industries , taking a path of integrated trade , industrial , and agricultural industrialization .  We must bolster qualified enterprises in their development of agricultural production , processing , and export bases , enhancing the motivating power on farmers by the market competition forces , and raising the level of agricultural production organization and the international competitive power of China 's agriculture .  
Although the " technical aspect " of their election cooperation , which external circles are most concerned about , might not seem effective , the " strategic aspect " of their alliance is rather strong .  Their overall integrated strength can be said to be " developing steadily . "  
The army is trying to raise its field air defense and mobile assault capability , the navy is forming a combat equipment system for sea-borne mobile and land-based defense of coastal waters , and the air force is forming a system that will be equipped for both attack and defense , a high - , medium - , and low-altitude , long - , medium - , and short-range integrated system of disposition combined with an antiaircraft intelligence network that can defend our national territory .  
In line with the overall plan of building three trans-regional integrated power grids in the northern , central and southern parts of China , during the " 10th Five-Year " plan period and based on the trans-regional power supply and integrated power grid project construction plan , we will build 2,500 kilometers of alternating current lines and 4,345 kilometers of direct current lines of 500 kilovolts .  
and resolve a number of problems currently facing our economic development , including an irrational industrial structure , a low industrialization level of new and high technologies , and poor market competitiveness .  We should stress launching a batch of engineering projects using new and high technologies , which include high-performance computers , photoelectronic materials and apparatus , the design and manufacturing of submicroscopic and deep-submicroscopic integrated circuits , biological technologies and their industrialization , biochips , and agro-biological projects .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
The integrated logistics support system 's overall function of coordination , highly efficient sectional function , and powerful regulatory function can make the entire system and all of the various sub-systems train their focus on the objective of support , playing a sustained and highly efficient role to ensure the best result of integration .  
The integrated logistics support system is independent organizationally and unitary task-wise .  The joint operational logistic support system alone is responsible for all general-purpose supplies and services and special-purpose supplies and services .  This will effectively remedy the drawback of the existing system in which general-purpose support and special-purpose support are " two separate lines " vertically and " detached " horizontally .  
To break out of the ideological deadlock and be free of the mode of " management by vertical lines of division , " the crucial thing to do is to proceed from the actual need of an integrated battlefield , firmly establish the mentality of the whole and , in light of the uniqueness of the essence of joint operation of various arms and services , build an organizational system that adapts to the blending of various support forces , to the release of various support capabilities and to the optimized allocation of various support resources .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
With the pace of opening to the outside world further accelerated , China 's economy will merge into the world economy in a still positive attitude , and the domestic market will be integrated with the international market with each passing day , which will contribute to better utilizing the domestic and foreign resources and provide economic growth with even greater room for maneuver .  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .

They have made resolute efforts to stop the inflow of drugs .  Officers and soldiers of the regiment working on the second line have integrated routine investigations at the checkpoints with patrol inspections and random inspections .  They have strengthened the control of both sides of bordering rivers and ports .  They have cut off drug inflow channels .  Personnel at border police stations are familiar with local people and places .  
We should , laying stress on youngsters and " high-risk groups , " go down to universities as well as middle and primary schools ; to public security lockups , reeducation-through-labor centers , detention centers , and rehabilitation centers ; and to residential districts , rural areas , enterprises , and public institutions to properly conduct preventive education on narcotics through various integrated measures to make every family and individual aware of the matter .  
The Chinese people have generally practiced pacifism and have the thinking and natural instincts of assuming the defensive .  These are integrated with their strong traditional ideology of blood relationship and their special social crowd structure .  One of the results of this humane culture is that hegemonism which is aimed at invading other countries will be difficult to develop .  
In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .  
integrated reform efforts , development speed , and social capacity for acceptance ; and formulated a series of principles and policies on developing the productive forces .  We should seize opportunities and advance in an enterprising spirit so as to secure a new great victory in reform , opening up , and socialist modernization .  
The following policies have been formulated to promote the development of the software and integrated circuit [ IC ] industries in our country ; strengthen the information technology [ IT ] industry 's capacity for innovation and international competitiveness ; spur on the transformation of traditional industries and promote product upgrading and new-generation products ; and further promote sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy :  
Soon afterwards , Luo Gan went to the BMPSB 's police affairs center to watch the development of the Beijing municipal integrated public security information network and non-native population information system as well as a demonstration of the satellite positioning system for financial institution alarms and to hear reports on the state of the BMPSB 's science and technological planning for the 10th Five-Year Plan period and planning for the " Golden Shield Project . "  
Judging from these reports , the " double thinking " educational activities in the previous stage went on smoothly and achieved initial successes because the leaders attached importance to them and because they were integrated with the reality and were conducted in numerous forms .  
Experts maintained that at the beginning of the next century , digitalization will become the new impetus for the development of information technology , the development of integrated circuit will enter a new stage of development of integrated system , the transmission capacity of the communications system of intensive channel distribution for repeated use [ mi ji bo fen fu yong tong xin xi tong ] will be greatly enhanced , and the technology and capacity of mobile telecommunications for individuals and the Internet will be improved several times over .

Raidi introduced new Tibet 's economic and social situation that emerged after the elimination of feudal serfdom that integrated religion with politics and the implementation of regional national autonomy .  He added that Tibet 's outstandingly traditional culture is a component of the culture of the Chinese nation .  China has always paid full attention to scientifically inheriting , protecting , and developing the outstandingly traditional culture of Tibet .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
set up a satellite ground application system combining sky and earth as a whole ; form a complete and independent sky-earth integrated network system capable of long-term and stable operations - - a sky-based comprehensive information system ;  
During this period , it was the " spring of science , " in which science and technology , as the primary productive forces , were more and more closely integrated with the economic construction .  In particular , with the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and technology being defined as the basic national policy , acceleration of scientific and technological progress was placed in an important position of economic and social development .  
Due to the limitations of the country 's structure and mechanisms , the problem of regional barriers and departmental protectionism does exist , to a certain extent , with the use of the country 's urban cultural resources ; and there is no an authoritative and integrated leading organ to exercise an effective management , and there lacks an overall planning in its real sense .  
Starting with reform of the structure , mechanism , and system and taking into account the deeper-level factors that produce negative phenomenon and corruption , the " Implementation Methods " drawn up by various departments ( units ) , have closely integrated with reality , identified crucial issues , defined the focus of the work of fighting corruption by grasping at the source at present and in the next few years , and put forward practicable measures and methods .  
For this reason , the important objective of this year 's economic and trade plans should be supporting the development of high and new technology industries , represented by electronics and information technology industries , and at the same time using high and new technology and advanced applicable technology to upgrade the traditional industry so that information infrastructure and industrialization can be integrated and can promote each other to achieve common development .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
Effectively stopping channels for the infiltrative influence of various wrong ideas , enlivening the cultural life in the barracks , and creating a positive and progressive ideological and political environment .  All units persistently integrated ideological education with the strict enforcement of discipline and with strict troop management .  
After the initial excitement subsided upon hearing Premier Zhu Rongji 's report on the outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , which lists " new carrier rocket models , " " high-speed , broad-band information networks , " and " key integrated circuits " as three major high-tech projects that China will give priority to supporting over the next five years , he has been pondering these questions : New carrier rocket models seem to have very little to do with the lives of ordinary people .  Why are we paying so much attention to them ?  
The 10th Five-Year Plan period will be an important period for improving the socialist market economic system , and one of the important tasks will be to further open the market and develop a national integrated market system that is standardized , encourages fair competition , and operates in an orderly way and to continuously increase the marketization of the national economy .  
The spokesman stressed that the scheme is not another type of care and attention home for the elderly but a specific housing initiative with integrated domestic and supportive components to enable the elderly to ' age in place ' and enjoy ' healthy ageing . ' "

Students with moderate to profound hearing impairment and having acquired sufficient language skills are integrated in ordinary classes .  Inspectors of ED visit schools regularly to advise teachers and social workers on how best to support these students .  
For the delivery of health care service , we shall strengthen preventive care , re-organise primary medical care , develop a community-focused , patient centred and knowledge based integrated health care service , and improve public / private interface .  
In 1962 , the City Hall Art Gallery and Museum was established in the Hong Kong City Hall , marking a rejuvenation of modern museum services in the territory .  Since then , the museum services have developed and expanded progressively with museums of different themes set up one by one , forming an integrated network in preserving local history , art and cultural heritage .  
The Council coordinates our technological development and explores ways to capitalize on innovation and technology in enhancing economic growth .  It has examined our advantages in respect to tertiary education , scientific research , commerce and industry , infrastructure , etc . and the global prospects on the technological front .  Four niches which Hong Kong has the potential and strength to excel were identified , namely biomedical research , integrated chips design , nanotechnology and service automation .  
In the coming years , our elderly services will aim at providing better support to elders in need and co-ordinating community and institutional care services .  For example , public rental estates with a high concentration of older people will be provided with integrated care services .

Also included among the many events being staged across London are exhibitions of photography depicting the brilliant skyline and ground-level developments ; contemporary Chinese ink paintings reflecting traditional techniques in its versatility ; and an architectural exhibition examining the way architecture , communications and the economy integrated to make Hong Kong Asia 's world city .  
Noting that the existing outline zoning plan ( OZP ) for the site envisages several commercial and residential lots for piecemeal development as well as open space and land for Government facilities and roads , the spokesman said the existing zoning is incompatible with the concept of inviting proposals from the private sector for a fully integrated development mixing cultural and commercial facilities and other diverse uses . 
Thus , subjects of academic , practical , vocational and integrated nature will be included in the curriculum to meet the different personal and vocational needs of students as well as the social , economic and technological demands of Hong Kong 's development .  
Thus , the three major government planning departments should use an integrated method for a long-term plan and not only use economic planning to cope with future social change . Only then can there be a " social miracle " to create a true People 's Livelihood " welfare state . " ( 2 ) A planning law should be established and interchange between planning personnel and line agencies strengthened .  
For just this reason , Stan Shih suggested in his presidential report that the government set up four new high-tech industrial parks in northern , central , southern , and eastern Taiwan that would be integrated with neighboring universities , research organizations , and satellite high-tech industrial parks to transform Taiwan into a high-tech island .  
Science and the fruits of science will be harmoniously integrated with human life . The modernity and completeness of its public facilities will actively promote a well-rounded existence which is pluralistic in both inspiration and application . The result will not only enhance our international image , but it will also turn us into a model of what modern living should be like . .  
These plans were produced by first of all bringing together a group of top-notch scientists , who would perform deep investigations , hold discussions and perform analysis and research before collectively coming up with worldwide development trends . Then related industrial departments would be mobilized to describe their scientific development needs . Finally , in accordance with the special strengths of Chinese research personnel , the three aspects would be integrated , and a most beneficial development plan would be proposed .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
Liu explains , " China 's court music was the music and dance extolled by Confucianists . Confucius combined rites , music , dance , poetry , and song into a coherent whole , creating a single integrated set of rules for proper ritual and decorum . " For instance , there were rules stipulating what dance the emperor was to use when worshipping Heaven , or what music was to be played for an imperial inspection tour . The fundamental principle was to create a harmonious society through cultivation of character and delineation of status .  
However , simple watch display chips can not meet the needs of Taiwan 's information industry companies , and Taiwan spends enormous amounts of foreign exchange on dynamic random access memory ( DRAM ) , static random access memory ( SRAM ) , central processing units ( CPUs ) and all kinds of other integrated circuits , which are assembled into computers and motherboards for export .  
It began in 1958 , when the first integrated circuit ( IC ) in the world was invented in the Dallas laboratory of the US firm Texas Instruments . Since then , the tiny semiconductor-whose " binary " structure of on and off , conducting ( allowing electricity to pass ) and non-conducting allows electric current to flow along specially-designed maze-like pathways-has become a focus of global manufacturing .  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
Of course , different countries are in different situations , and the external threats faced by these countries are not comparable to the cross-strait situation . PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although the idea of taking a war beyond Taiwan is worth consideration , it would only be really useful if it could be adopted into the national security structure and done in an integrated and comprehensive way .  
Today , multinational enterprises are no longer based on simple subsidiary or manufacturing relationships . Today they are highly planned and integrated transnational organizations . An important test for Taiwan firms as they internationalize in the future will be their ability to make plans for and integrate multinational resources .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
In the advisory report issued in 1998 by the Executive Yuan 's Education Reform Committee , there is no sign of the words " integrated curriculum . " However , the committee members agreed that existing subject divisions were too narrow , and that children mostly studied fragmentary , disjointed knowledge completely divorced from their life experience . Thus " course integration " was an obvious orientation for change .  
However , an even greater breakthrough is the way the integrated curriculum redefines the " textbook . " In future both the approved textbooks now used in elementary schools , and the standard textbooks used in junior high , may be relegated from their leading classroom role to a supporting role , for " diverse teaching materials " and " school-developed courses " are another big change introduced by the new curriculum .  
Also , in line with the general trend in education reform toward diversification of teaching materials , the integrated curriculum not only abolishes the current requirement for junior high schools to use the standard textbooks published by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation , allowing them to use any approved textbook instead , but it also allows county and city governments , schools , and teachers to produce their own teaching materials , and particularly encourages schools to form " curriculum development committees " to devise course content .  
" The integrated curriculum should not be too disruptive for elementary schools , " says Ou Yung-sheng , because the subject divisions in elementary schools were already very broad , and their teaching arrangements are generally close to a single " class teacher " system , with one teacher teaching several different subjects . Therefore integrating the subjects should not be too difficult .  
Logically speaking , it might seem reasonable to expect that the nine-year integrated curriculum would have to be built from the ground floor up , starting with first grade and advancing one year at a time all the way until ninth grade ( i.e . the third year of junior high ) , with the entire process of its implementation taking nine years .  
Lu Hsiu-na , head of the social studies textbook group at KST , reports : " Everyone at KST is busy compiling textbooks for the fourth and seventh grades to support the integrated curriculum schedule . We have to leave third , fifth , and sixth grade textbooks for later . " In Lu 's opinion , learning is a process of cognitive development , and textbooks ought to be compiled sequentially , tracing the path of that development .  
From the very start , Yung'an has served as an experimental school for the nine-year integrated curriculum . Taiwan 's textbook publishers are now hard at work compiling textbooks for the integrated curriculum , but they have only finished with the first grade so far . The teachers at Yung'an , however , started working long ago to create an integrated curriculum of their own . Using existing textbooks as reference , they have already developed several integrated textbooks for the second and third grades .  
" The approach adopted now at chinatimes.com is to integrate a number of e-papers and mail these out to members . Although no fees are collected from members , the profit lies in the hidden vertical-depth e-commerce represented by each member , " says Michael Chang , chief operations officer . By working with businesses , treating the e-paper platform as a giant shopping center , and using integrated operations , not only can a news-oriented e-paper survive , its professional reputation can be a guarantee of reliability to consumers .  
Fortunately , when the integrated nine-year curriculum goes into effect , there will be more time devoted to sex education in junior high and elementary school classrooms . The education will provide the kids with a more complete understanding of sexual issues , including discussions about ethics , behavioral changes , and self-protection . These classes are not just going to focus on sensationalistic aspects of sex .  
At that time the MOE had just launched its new " nine-year integrated curriculum , " which reset the first year of English-language study at the fifth grade effective in 2001 . In order to fill the spaces created by the expansion , the MOE sent out a call for qualified English teachers , ultimately resulting in the recruiting of 3500 trainees . However , just two years later more than 1500 teachers , nearly half of the group intended to be the color guard of the new primary English-language instruction , had fallen by the wayside .  
To break the " teaching by subject " mold that had characterized teaching at the primary and middle school levels for more than ten years , the " integrated curriculum " for grades 1 to 9 was introduced four years ago . Although it reduced ten subjects to seven major disciplines , the core subjects of mathematics , Chinese and English remained clearly delineated in the classroom .  
Teachers are also very concerned about the possibility of lowered academic competence on the part of their students , given the fact that the increasingly diversified subject matter of the new integrated curriculum takes away from time spent on basic subjects .  
Chou takes the nine-year integrated curriculum as an example . Neither the idea of a system integrating the content to be studied in Grades 1-9 , nor that of academic " fields , " are new . In fact , these things had been spelled out in previous curricular standards . In past decades , however , one saw the prevalent use of " contracting out " specialized tasks within Taiwan 's education system , so much so that now that things have been opened up , people can not imagine doing otherwise .  
" This type of flexible class would have been impossible before the nine-year integrated curriculum , " says Li . Of course , she also does as is required and teaches three formal biology classes . While these classes may be rigid , she says , they must be attended to , since " if test scores are n't good , students will feel frustrated , and parents will protest . "  
the settlement of the question of population must always be closely integrated with the promotion of all round social and economic development for developing countries , the primary task is to eliminate poverty , improve education , health care , living conditions , enhance women 's status and strengthen environmental protection  
They should be addressed in a balanced and integrated manner and protected and promoted with due regard for specific cultural , social , economic and political circumstances .  
With its limited financial and human resources , it is trying to control the problem at the national level , and to contribute at a regional and international level in an integrated and comprehensive manner .  
Hence , it can not be solved by isolated and fragmented strategies but must be addressed in a coordinated , comprehensive and integrated way , employing resources at all levels of the national and international community .  
Governments were requested to rationalize urban growth and improve the quality of life in rural areas through the promotion of integrated rural development programmes with economic , social and environmental dimensions .  
The development of an integrated mining system that would be operational in an actual deep seabed environment on a sustained basis is demanding both in terms of time and effort and requires substantial financial inputs .  
The Fund also supported a wide range of activities to further integrate family planning into primary healthcare networks , improve the quality of existing services and extend integrated MCH / FP services to poor and remote areas .  
It bases its findings on the emergence of new strategies and structures at the firm level which , in the aggregate , suggest that a more integrated international production system is emerging and may influence the future pattern of global economic relations .  
We recognize that all human rights , including the right to development , are universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated and that as such are of equal importance and should be addressed in a balanced and integrated manner .  
Such efforts should bring together those responsible for economic , financial and social policy and provide an integrated framework for guiding national and international policies aimed at meeting the current challenges of the world economy .  
The Assembly should focus on the development of norms , standards and rules of the game required to manage global interdependence in a rapidly changing international environment and promote an integrated approach to economic and social development .  
With renewed waves of human rights violations occurring worldwide , mostly in internal conflicts or ethnic strife , our Organization has to step up its early-warning and preventive capacities , develop an integrated response mechanism encompassing field visits and monitors , a closer integration of the human rights element in peace-keeping activities and ensuring effective interaction in the implementation of political , peace-keeping , human rights and humanitarian mandates .  
Let us suppose , then , that the world of the future will have to be shaped according to regions , or large integrated groups or communities , regional or otherwise , that have a common cultural origin and wish to be identified with the others , because of the particular characteristics of their culture , such as tradition , language , religion and even mixed blood . 
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
When the founding fathers of the 1945 Charter forged close structural links between the Court and the United Nations , they obviously intended that the Court should be fully integrated into the new system for the peaceful settlement of disputes that had just been devised , but they did not in any way wish to deprive the Court of the autonomy indispensable to the sound administration of justice .  
The globalization of socio-economic activities calls for an integrated and universal approach , for if the development of the world economy is not accompanied by regulations and corrective mechanisms , it runs the risk of increasing destabilization and of breeding social and ecological imbalances . 
Jamaica 's national youth policy was therefore designed to redress all these deficiencies , but first of all to bring an integrated approach to the activities of youth organizations nation wide and to equip all youth with the necessary academic , technical and life-coping skills to foster their personal development .  
As is recalled in resolution 48 / 162 , the General Assembly is the main forum where Governments pursue the development dialogue in a political context , oriented towards taking an integrated view of matters pertaining to the economic , social and related fields in order to build and deepen the political understanding required for enhanced international development cooperation . 
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Here I would like to echo the proposal made by President Ben Ali , Chairman of the OAU last year , for a global economic and social plan aimed at ensuring the development of Africa on a sound and lasting basis , helping our continent overcome its shortcomings and become integrated into the world economy and ensuring dignified conditions of life for all the peoples of the continent .  
States Members of the United Nations are invited to develop and implement an integrated national action programme for the development of and transition to an energy system that allows socio-economic development to fulfil basic human needs and improve the quality of life , takes care of environmental concerns , guarantees security of supply and uses finite resources sparingly , in the interest of present and future generations .  
Nationally determined policies for integrated and multifaceted programmes , with special attention to women , to the poorest people living in critical areas and to other vulnerable groups should be implemented , ensuring the involvement of groups with a special potential to act as agents for change and sustainable development .  
Adopting integrated management systems , particularly for the management of natural resources ; traditional or indigenous methods should be studied and considered wherever they have proved effective ; women 's traditional roles should not be marginalized as a result of the introduction of new management systems ;  
Develop and disseminate to farming households integrated farm management technologies , such as crop rotation , organic manuring and other techniques involving reduced use of agricultural chemicals , multiple techniques for sources of nutrients and the efficient utilization of external inputs , while enhancing techniques for waste and by-product utilization and prevention of pre - and post-harvest losses , taking particular note of the role of women ;  
The comprehensive and integrated approach to human rights means that those rights are understood to be universal , indivisible , interdependent and interrelated , which enables all civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights , as well as the right to development , to be dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair and even-handed manner .  
Stressing also that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance provided in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking humanitarian assistance with economic aid for national reconstruction and development ,  
Aware of the importance of supporting the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace in Central America , and bearing in mind that the Central American Integration System constitutes the institutional framework for subregional integration through which integrated development can be promoted in an effective , orderly and coherent manner ,  
At the international level priority should be given to the development of a holistic and integrated framework to put in place social and economic conditions which will facilitate optimum matching of land resources with needs , in terms of production , sustainability , and conservation of biodiversity , together with the necessary technical and infrastructural support , which can be applied in any country with appropriate modifications , according to local needs and conditions .  Proposal 2 .  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
At the Paris ceremony , AfDB committed itself to play an active part in implementing the Convention , in line with the important role assigned to it under the provisions of the Convention , particularly in terms of integrated activities in key areas such as improving national economic environments , the sustainable use of natural resources , efficient energy use , capacity-building and sensitization .  
Activities under chapter 15 and related chapters of Agenda 21 , together with measures contained in the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant legal instruments and agreements , thus need to be integrated into political , social and economic policy-making at every level .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
In this context , my Government wishes to emphasize the need for the quick deployment of UNAVEM III , because it alone as we all know will bear responsibility for the quartering , disarming and selection of UNITA troops that are to be integrated into the unified national army of Angola and for the demobilization of the excess military personnel that will be reintegrated into civilian life after receiving vocational training .  
The main issue in increasing productivity and sustainability in rain-dependent areas is how to maximize conservation and utilization of the natural rainfall , coupled with the development and adoption of technologies to promote integrated soil , water , crop and livestock management consistent with environmental sustainability at the farm household level .  
As in previous thematic discussions , there was recognition of the urgent importance of gathering information and gender-disaggregated data , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels , with a view to assessing the prevailing reality affecting girls , identifying persisting problems and challenging the prevalence of invisibility , which in turn allows for the perpetuation of vulnerability .  
The Secretary-General , in his peacemaking initiative and in close consultation with the Security Council , sent to Tajikistan a small integrated United Nations unit of political , military and humanitarian officers to monitor the situation on the ground , provide liaison services and constitute a ground core for any possible more extensive United Nations participation in the regional efforts in Tajikistan in the future .  
In view of the challenging international context marked by countries in transition , ethnic conflicts , increase in refugees , acute complex developmental need and humanitarian assistance , the role of the resident coordinator - to lead a strong , integrated , effective team at the country level - has become even more crucial .  
Aware that the voluntary repatriation of large numbers of Somali refugees in neighbouring countries and elsewhere , as well as the return of internally displaced persons to their original homes , will still require a planned and integrated international assistance programme designed to cover their basic needs , ensure adequate reception arrangements and facilitate their smooth integration into their respective communities ,  
The three political , military or humanitarian functions can be carried out in integrated and unified operations , provided that there are clearly established modalities of cooperation , including information sharing , transparency , joint planning and logistics ;  
To facilitate their effective implementation , it may be necessary to assemble , with full participation of all concerned entities of the United Nations system , all the pieces in a single , integrated operational framework with clear-cut priorities , time-bound targets in line with those set by the World Summit for Social Development in the most crucial areas , and well-defined responsibilities for national and international efforts .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
The purpose of integrated plans and strategies is to develop a consensual vision for the future and to identify common priority issues and key activities within a framework that provides for consensus-building and planning and the creation of the institutional support required for sustainable development .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based upon sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
As stated in the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Seminar ( A / AC . 109 / 1107 ) , its primary objective was to review economic and social conditions in the Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean region and identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in programmes of assistance and development and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the viable and sustainable development of the Territories concerned .  
Taking into account the main development objectives established by the Territory 's Executive Council , namely , the improved management of the economy through a more efficient public sector , the strategic development of human resources through the reform of the educational and training systems , and the development of integrated policies of physical infrastructural improvements , as well as the preservation of the natural environment ,  
Field projects . ( i ) Establishment of four port reception facilities in the Mediterranean ; ( ii ) two field projects on the assessment of threats to marine mammals ; ( iii ) one marine biodiversity assessment ; ( iv ) strengthening of four institutional arrangements for integrated coastal zone planning and management ; and ( v ) 10 projects to assist Mediterranean countries to set up their legislation concerning specially protected areas .  
The subprogramme , in collaboration with United Nations organizations and international and national research institutions , aims at promoting the further development and application integrated environmental and economic analysis instruments , as well as national , regional and international programmes and policies for sound environmental management and sustainable development .  
The programme comprises four interrelated and mutually supportive functions : ( a ) developing statistical concepts and methods for use by Member States ; ( b ) collecting , processing and disseminating integrated statistics ; ( c ) promoting the coordination of international statistical activities ; and ( d ) supporting technical cooperation in statistics and statistical data processing , including informatics .  
These activities include basic statistical and methodological work in national accounts , international merchandise trade , commodity production , energy , population and human settlements , the environment , prices , the role of women , social indicators and special population groups , and general integrated databases .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
The Commission noted the importance of developing , among the organizations of the United Nations system , a common or compatible system of access to their respective databases , in order to share data fully , to streamline the collection and interpretation of data and to identify data gaps , for the purpose of providing more comprehensive and integrated data to decision makers at the national , regional and international levels .  
The Commission requests the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to organize , within existing resources , regional workshops to explore , discuss and further develop methodological approaches to integration based upon , for example , work being done in environmental economics , valuation , natural resource accounting and integrated economic and environmental accounting .  
Their needs for coordinated information and advice will be addressed through the development and operation of a centralized system of integrated databases , inter alia , on marine legislation and marine policy , as well as by intensifying general legal advice and other advisory services and by focusing dissemination of information on national , regional and international developments in the law of the sea and ocean affairs .  
For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
Particularly in recommendation 9 , it has stressed the urgent need to gather data and disaggregated information on a gender basis , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels with a view to assessing the current reality of women , identifying persistent problems and challenging the invisibility of women 's human rights .  
" human resources development is a broad concept . . . requiring integrated and concerted strategies , policies , plans and programmes to ensure the development of the full potential of human beings . . . so that they may , individually and collectively , be capable of improving their standard of living " .  
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
UNIDO offers a demand-oriented , integrated human resource development programme in three primary areas interlocking at three levels of support intervention : ( a ) policy advice based on analysis and assessment of requirements ; ( b ) institutional capacity-building and catalytic learning systems , including training , at subsector levels and in specialized fields ; and ( c ) communication networks to facilitate coordination and synergy of efforts .  
It was agreed that the forging of an integrated United Nations system approach in post-conflict situations could be greatly assisted by the development of a strategic framework combining political , humanitarian , economic and social areas of intervention .  
Those results will then need to be integrated into a clear set of conclusions and policy recommendations for advancing international understanding and consensus on forest issues : on that basis , the Panel is expected to propose coherent approaches to addressing the problem of the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests .  
Through its normative and field programmes at the global , regional , national and local levels in assessment and monitoring of land resources , policy and planning assistance , development and transfer of technologies , capacity building and demonstration in agriculture , livestock , forestry , fisheries and rural development .  FAO continues to contribute actively to desertification control , drought preparedness and mitigation and integrated dry land development in affected countries .  
The feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national crime prevention and criminal justice legislation and its implementation was to be determined , with a view to encouraging appropriate alignment in international cooperation through such means as extradition and other modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Department staff held meetings with the senior representatives of the League to discuss joint actions to organize a regional seminar on a new integrated approach for sustainable human development : spatial / sectoral development strategy for Arab countries .  
In his report on the mission he undertook to the United States of America ( E / CN . 4 / 1995 / 78 / Add . 1 ) , " The Special Rapporteur found sociological inertia , structural obstacles and individual resistance hindering the emergence of an integrated society based on the equal dignity of the members of the American nation and willing to accept ethnic and cultural pluralism " ( para .  NULL  
In addition , it promotes assessment , integrated development and management of water resources ; and addresses the need for planned mineral resources exploration and development and responsible land use , through training , exchange of information , technical advice and the strengthening of relevant national and regional institutions .  
In the end , the design concept involved the elements of a vertical city in the park ( a tall rectangular slab ) and an integrated civic centre ( composed of the slab , a low General Assembly building and a horizontal link , the Conference building ) .  
The Commission for Social Development would play a central role , in particular from the perspective of social integration ; the Secretariat would report to the Council on the activities and findings of other relevant functional commissions ; in deciding , the year before , on the contents of its review the Council would take into account the related choice of theme ( s ) for the integrated consideration of the follow-up of major conferences .  
For example , a cooperative program was undertaken examining commercial cotton fields in the San Joaquin Valley of California , aimed at developing integrated tools to produce crops that maximize economic return , support efficient use of natural resources , and minimize detrimental impacts on the environment .  
At the level of the United Nations and its agencies , the strengthening of the capacity of the system to support an integrated , effective follow-up to the Fourth World Conference as part of the overall effort to ensure the coordinated implementation of the results of the series of recent global conferences should be a key objective in pursuing further the ongoing reform process .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .

The series of major world conferences set to conclude next November with the World Food Summit a positive initiative welcomed by my country is an encouraging sign of the international community 's resolve to meet these challenges in the best interests of the peoples of the world , on the basis of a comprehensive , integrated approach to human development .  
My Government has set itself specific goals including balanced and integrated sectoral growth , a relevant and adaptive education system , health for all , and strategic human resource planning and development .  
The Agenda for Development will be of no practical value to the developing countries if it limits itself to an analysis of the world economic outlook while failing to put forward specific action-oriented measures for implementation in an integrated and coordinated manner .  
In order to effect such an integrated scheme of cooperation along the lines I have just outlined , my delegation believes that the institution of inter-agency task forces , as established by the Administrative Committee on Coordination , can be a major channel through which participating agencies can engage in constructive dialogue for the purpose of ensuring close cooperation in effectively implementing the Programme of Action . Intensified efforts for coordination and cooperation are very much desired .  
His treatment of the subject of a fourth special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament ( SSOD IV ) integrated well the range of positions held by delegations , further spelt out in thoughtful papers put forward by delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement and of the European Union , and by New Zealand .  
Endorses the need for a global knowledge base on mineral resource potential , in terms of potential source areas , to be developed so that it can be integrated with other land-use information as an essential part of an integrated approach to the planning and management of natural resources ;  
This has served ( a ) as a driving force for a better division of system-wide efforts , as evidenced by the subject-matter focus of the three task forces ; ( b ) as an enabling mechanism for integrated country-level action ; and ( c ) as a vehicle for critical new input on complex development issues , as evidenced by the Secretary-General 's Africa regional-level initiative on agreed development objectives and the United Nations system-wide approach to the HIV / AIDS pandemic . 
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
It was currently preparing an integrated plan of action to combat the so-called " paramilitary " groups that had sown death and terror in rural areas , and planned to reactivate a special armed group capable of tackling those groups successfully .  
To support standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
Promote the active participation of all stakeholders , including those in isolated and remote communities , in ensuring the integrated consideration of the environmental , social and economic objectives of rural development efforts ;  
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
To strengthen their support for actions at the national level and to enhance their contributions to an integrated and coordinated follow-up by the United Nations , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system should identify the specific actions they will undertake to meet the priorities identified in the Global Plan of Action .  
The Executive Director of UNDCP has encouraged resident coordinators and resident representatives , as well as the directors of UNDCP regional and country offices , to pursue closely all channels to enhance an integrated approach to problems touching on the mandates of several agencies , thus consolidating scarce resources in an effective manner by eliminating overlap and proliferation of parallel interventions .  
Experience has served to design a comprehensive project for the dissemination of and education in human and indigenous rights , through integrated mass public information campaigns that use media and messages tailored to the population 's socio-economic and cultural context and give particular importance to the multi-ethnic nature of Guatemala .  
Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
The policies and measures in support of these objectives set out in the Programme of Action revolve around the following major areas : establishment of a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to sustained economic growth and long-term development ; development and mobilization of human resources ; development , expansion and modernization of the productive base ; reversing the trend towards environmental degradation ; promotion of an integrated policy of rural development aimed at increasing food production , enhancing rural income and enhancing non-agricultural sector activities ; and the provision of adequate external support .  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
To integrate environment and development in the policies and practices of each country effectively , it is necessary to develop and implement integrated , enforceable and effective laws and regulations that are based on sound social , ecological , economic and scientific principles .  
As the Mission approaches full deployment and with the operations of the logistic support service contract , emphasis was given to the strengthening of selected areas of administration and integrated support services to ensure optimum efficiency in the utilization of human resources and the timely provision of services to military and civilian personnel .  
This responsibility is reflected in the adoption of an integrated approach at the local and national levels in order to ensure access to affordable and reliable services for the children and dependants ( particularly those who are elderly and disabled ) of women and men who are working , undergoing training , studying or seeking employment .  
The Governing Council of UNDP , at its thirty-eighth session ( 1991 ) , adopted comprehensive legislation , in keeping with General Assembly resolution 44 / 211 on the comprehensive triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , that put forth new initiatives relating to the national execution of technical cooperation activities , and the development of projects according to an integrated and prioritized national programme , and placed renewed emphasis on human development and capacity-building in development activities .  
In its resolution 1995 / 27 , section II , the Council requested the Secretary-General to consider the feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national legislation in crime prevention and criminal justice and its implementation , taking into account the current and planned capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network and the activities of other United Nations entities and relevant intergovernmental organizations .  
47 The central theme in all the information provided by States on this subject is the need to further enhance international cooperation which , if integrated with national efforts , will form a comprehensive strategy against organized transnational crime .  
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
Decisions on questions affecting the marine environment must be the result of an integrated approach , taking into account all relevant environmental , social and economic factors , including the special requirements of developing countries , as well as the best available scientific evidence .  
The Working Group also stressed the need for increased support for training and capacity-building in the field of integrated management of coastal areas , and stressed the need for taking action to protect all critical habitats of marine living resources in the coastal zone , including coral reefs , mangroves , mudflats and estuaries .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
However , the Working Group considered that the existing coordinating structures , at least at the international level , were sufficient to ensure the treatment of the atmosphere protection issues in an integrated manner , and the establishment of new intergovernmental bodies could not therefore be justified .  
To that end , the concerned national institutions in the countries most affected will be strengthened , enabling them to elaborate , implement , monitor and evaluate integrated national programmes designed to eliminate illicit crops through alternative development and other modalities .  
Urgent action of a new type is needed to ensure that water 's deep involvement in both environment and development issues can be properly addressed , action that will demand an integrated approach to land use , water-supply and waste management , with due attention to all water 's parallel functions in nature and society , as well as to the evident linkages between upstream land and water use and downstream opportunities . 
To approach the crisis as merely a technical water management issue , in the conventional fragmented way would actually aggravate the situation ; regional political involvement at the highest level of government will be needed to articulate a national water resources strategy that is fully integrated into national planning .  
The evolution of an integrated land / water-oriented action plan to achieve a balanced development of the river system , taking into account all relevant factors ( demographic changes , ecological , socio-economic , hydrologic and hydraulic factors , and spatial and agronomic potentials of the basin ) and ensuring proper attention to urban / rural and upstream / downstream competition for water ;

Educational institutions will be assisted in designing and implementing preventive education and health promotion programmes to be integrated into a comprehensive health education context covering both physical and psycho-social health , addressing cognitive factors , attitudes and skills , emphasizing the individual and group behaviours that put a person at risk , both as concerns drug abuse and other health-related problems . 
The objective is to contribute towards a better understanding of the conditions and trends in human settlements in the region and to support countries in establishing balanced and integrated human settlement systems , improving housing , infrastructure and services and instituting proper management of the urban process .  
The Organization will be a central actor in this respect for the foreseeable future , not simply because of its role within the international community , but also because Africa 's problems encompass political , economic , social and environmental dimensions that require the integrated approach that only the United Nations can provide .

The Ministers reaffirmed the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by an integrated and balanced application of national , regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for , production of and trafficking in drugs .  
Moreover , the special combination of inputs technical assistance and emergency supplies on the one hand and materials for construction and water equipment on the other ( benefiting approximately 110,000 people ) has made possible the implementation of an integrated emergency and rehabilitation programme whose overall objective is to facilitate a smooth and sustainable transition from emergency to development , through effective and direct involvement of the beneficiaries themselves . 
As the principal forum of the United Nations for the integrated treatment of development and interrelated issues in the areas of trade , finance , investment , technology and sustainable development , UNCTAD is expected to make a substantial contribution to the pursuit of the international communitys common development objectives .  
Through these multifaceted but integrated activities , UNCTAD should contribute to ensuring the overall coherence of the global economic system and to making it more conducive to fighting poverty , reducing inequality within and among nations , protecting the right of present and future generations to the preservation of the environment , integrating women on an equal basis , generating employment and integrating the marginalized fully into the global economy .  
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration . 
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
Thirdly , financial and exchange rate instability were closely related and in fact fueled one another , with the result that an integrated treatment of trade and finance was essential for designing consistent national and global policies .

Calls for effective governance of globalization through democratization of international economic policy decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and developmental issues by the relevant international institutions ; and reform of the international financial architecture and , in this context , calls for close cooperation and coordination between the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization ;  
Further improvement of the international debt strategy should be in line with the once and for all approach designed to reduce the overall stock of debt of the indebted countries and should include the adoption of an integrated approach to all types of indebtedness , including multilateral , bilateral and commercial debt .  
Yet , as world trade , investment and financial flows continue to expand at a remarkable pace , so has the need for establishing integrated , flexible , fast , cost-effective and environmentally sound national and international transport and communications become more pronounced .  
The Governing Council session had given concrete support to the integrated work programme of UNEP , which was based on five areas of concentration environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning , enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environmental policy instruments ; freshwater ; technology transfer in industry ; and support to Africa and had endorsed its new functional organizational structure .  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of national and local initiatives in Norway , a preparatory process to implement Agenda 21 in local communities was already under way and of a holistic , cross-sectoral approach that integrated environmental , economic and social concerns .  
It was working throughout the developing world to fight land degradation and poverty ; in Asia , it had initiated a programme targeting very poor rural households in upland areas , which integrated natural resource management , economic diversification and the creation of local employment . 
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
The administrative and technical structure of primary health care has been developed at the central and local levels in such a way as to constitute an integrated system conducive to the promotion of development through collaboration among all the sectors concerned with health and development .  
To achieve the objective of promoting , on a horizontal and integrated perspective , equality among men and women in measures and actions , in work , employment and at the professional training level , the measures for affirmative action must be considered implicit in the first three pillars referred to above .  
Her delegation had always stressed the need to classify ethnic groups in order to facilitate national policies on the rights of national minorities and indigenous people , and believed that the draft declaration should make a distinction between two categories of indigenous groups , those leading a tribal way of life on isolated reservations and those integrated with the rest of society .  
Globalization should therefore be re-examined from four broad perspectives : democratization of international economic decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues by international institutions ; reform of the international financial architecture ; and effective action against the marginalization of developing countries .  
The solution lay in a globalization of development , and Pakistan therefore proposed the consideration of the following issues : creation of an enabling international economic environment ; reform of the global financial architecture ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues ; a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem ; and fulfilment by the developed countries of their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of their GNP to ODA .  
Notes , in particular , Governing Council decision 20 / 31 of 4 February 1999 , entitled Proposed programme budget of the United Nations Environment Programme : revised requirements for the biennium 1998-1999 and proposed requirements for the biennium 2000-2001 , which gives concrete support to the integrated work programme of the Programme and endorsement of its new functional organizational structure , and anticipates an increased level of funding to the Environment Fund for the biennium 2000-2001 ;  
The positions identified for the three mutually reinforcing and complementary ( integrated ) pillars of justice , police and human rights , as well as for the Office of the Representative of the Secretary-General , exclusive of the Administration , are considered the minimum necessary for the satisfactory performance of the Mission .  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
The matter of displaced persons and refugees could be settled only with the participation of the international community as a whole in establishing plans for integrated economic and social development through increased financial and technical cooperation .  
The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .  
The Department is responsible for the management and direction of peacekeeping operations ; the provision of comprehensive administrative and logistic support to all field missions ; the development , maintenance and enhancement of a ready , flexible capacity to undertake peacekeeping and other field operations ; and for acting as the focal point in the coordination , monitoring and development of integrated mine-action programmes .  
In addition , the programme , through greater international cooperation and coordination and increased effectiveness of the United Nations human rights machinery , focuses on improving respect for human rights at the national level , the adoption of a comprehensive and integrated United Nations approach to the promotion and protection of human rights and on more efficient methods to prevent human rights violations and remove obstacles to the full realization of human rights . 
The main issues they addressed include adult education , legal and social security , integrated systems of welfare and health actions and services , with a focus on Alzheimer ' s patients some half a-million persons in Italy are afflicted in old age by this illness active ageing , empowerment , ageing and gender , and social security .  
Special mention should be made of our Bolivar 2000 plan , an initiative of the Presidency of the Republic to provide resources and professional and logistical capabilities from the armed forces to the population in order to establish an integrated social-service programme aimed , inter alia , at the provision of timely assistance to meet the peoples basic needs and at rehabilitating the social infrastructure .  
In our view , the only worthwhile approach to this problem encompasses human rights in a comprehensive , integrated and indivisible way : all human rights , which is to say the basic economic , cultural and social needs of every individual , along with civil and political rights .  
Their successful conclusion on the basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions will benefit the peoples of the region including the people of Cyprus , who live with the vision of a free , united and peaceful island , without foreign troops and barbed wire and with its people integrated and cooperating as they did for centuries in the past . 
The Commission was convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach was required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at the intergovernmental and inter-agency level .  
However we address the issues , emphasizing the economic , social and cultural aspects of population and development as integrated into various sectors , my Government strongly believes that the Programme of Action can be achieved only if we can accept the standard rules and procedures in principle but are able , when it comes to the implementation of programmes and activities , to be flexible to allow for adjustments based on every country ' s specific needs .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
We believe that the Barbados Programme of Action , which calls for actions to be implemented at the national , regional and international levels , provides for an integrated and comprehensive basis for the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
Further urges Governments , with the assistance of relevant United Nations agencies , funds and programmes , to adopt a long-term , timely , coherent and integrated AIDS prevention policy , with public information and education programmes specifically tailored to the needs of women and girls within their sociocultural contexts and sensitivities and specific needs in their life cycle ;  
The Commission is therefore convinced that , building on existing arrangements , a more integrated approach is required to all legal , economic , social and environmental aspects of the oceans and seas , both at intergovernmental and inter-agency levels .  
To create the appropriate institutional , legal , economic , social and environmental framework by developing and applying a mix of instruments , as appropriate , such as integrated land-use planning and coastal zone management , economic instruments , social and environmental impact assessment for tourist facilities , including gender aspects , and voluntary initiatives and agreements ;  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Participants agreed that the Commission on Sustainable Development should facilitate funding from international agencies such as the World Bank and from national Governments for integrated environmental , social and economic research on best management practices in regard to design , development and management of tourism projects in coastal regions .  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
As stressed by the Harare expert group , integrated water resource management is therefore essential for integrating and reconciling interests in the river basin whether national or international with regard to water quality , quantity and the aquatic ecosystems .  
The Committee noted that barriers to the integration of economic , social and environmental objectives persist in current approaches to water management , but that solutions can only be found if clear integrated development frameworks are agreed at all levels of society and a long-term commitment given to the development of public health and natural resource policy , strategic planning and the mobilization of resources .  
The Committee took note of the Harare expert group meeting in January 1998 , which concluded that integrated water resources management is essential for reconciling the interests of all actors in the river basin whether national or international regarding water quantity , quality and ecosystem protection .  
In the light of the immense potential of space remote sensing in providing vital input for soil conservation , water resources , management , forest monitoring , land management , coastal and river basin protection , agriculture and drought management , and flood mapping and sustainable integrated development , action must be initiated to promote intensive cooperation among various countries within the region to enable them to benefit from each others expertise .  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
Most efforts on integrated coastal area management , though technically innovative and successful in various cases , have evolved at the local level , leaving them isolated from the mainstream of national development planning ; furthermore , such efforts have not attracted substantial funding , making the initiatives less effective than they could be ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
Efforts directed at the elimination of all inferior treatment and discrimination of which women are victims should be continued until they achieve equal opportunities with men and are fully integrated into the process of socio _ economic , cultural and political development of the country ;  
All Governments shall formulate integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels .  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
Losses in biodiversity and economic growth due to unplanned activities related to dredging , lack of clear property rights and control on natural resources , the low level of investments , and lack of participation in decision-making are conditions that have brought integrated coastal zone management onto the political agenda , and programmes are gradually being developed .  
For instance , problems of water supply in terms of both quantity and quality , environmentally sound management of solid and liquid wastes , adaptation to climate change and sea level rise , integrated management of coastal zones , prevention or minimization of natural and environmental disasters among others , all call for specific skills , without which small island developing States even with the highest level of political will can not hope to solve them .  
The laudable initiative of convening a special session on the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits should be continued on an annual basis ; debates should focus on themes agreed in the substantive session , taking into account the need to balance action and experience at the national level with the results and requirements of international cooperation .  
During the session of the Council on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , held in May 1998 , the Council had proved that it was playing an important role in the guidance and oversight of its subsidiary bodies ; it had identified , inter alia , poverty eradication as the overriding objective of its efforts and had recognized the need to address the problem of declining resources for the implementation of conferences .  
Provision of technical cooperation services , upon request , to countries of the region in connection with public-sector programming ; economic development and local management ; management of public territorial policies ; national public investment systems ; and integrated management of investment projects ; ( ii ) Group training .  
The structure described above on a preliminary basis represents , in my judgement , the optimum for an effective and integrated international civil presence in Kosovo , which can fulfil the provisions of Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) with the assistance of relevant international organizations , under the leadership of the United Nations . Consultations are being undertaken with the organizations concerned to refine this concept further . 
The Commissions achievements had contributed to a better understanding of the issues at hand and to a greater awareness of the integrated and coherent policies that needed to be pursued at the national and international level and of the need for supportive international mechanisms and actions .  
An integrated , collaborative and coordinated approach to facilities policy , administrative and budgetary information exchange is being formulated to promote effective and efficient planning , management , maintenance and operation for all Headquarters and overseas physical facilities of the Organization .  
Respect for human rights required an integrated vision of rights , under which social and economic rights would be placed on an equal footing with civil and political rights .  
Calls for effective governance of globalization through democratization of international economic policy decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and developmental issues by the relevant international institutions ; and reform of the international financial architecture and , in this context , calls for close cooperation and coordination between the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization ;

Indeed , today more than ever , conflictprevention must become a global and integrated strategy to ensure in the long term not only the absence of armed conflict , but that conditions remain conducive to political , economic , social and cultural peace .  
It shared the view that the successful implementation of the integrated programmes was dependent on substantial voluntary funding and supported UNIDOs intention to attract financial resources from , inter alia , UNDP and the private sector .  
An international cooperative programme on integrated landuse planning and management should begin by taking stock of existing knowledge and local , national and international experience in a more systematic and detailed manner .  
Parallel to the understanding of the indivisible nature of human rights is an understanding of the integrated political , economic , social , cultural and environmental nature of development .  
Such a system must also include the principles of diversity and holistic and integrated development , based not only on economic but also on political , social , gender , cultural and environmental dimensions .  
This new framework is a holistic and integrated approach to development strategies and programs that highlights the interdependence of all aspects of development strategy : social , human , institutional , environmental , economic and financial .  
At the national level , poverty eradication was the official objective of the ninth fiveyear plan , which included decentralization , agricultural development and integrated agroforestry development .  
In only a few developing countries , mostly in Asia and Latin America , have domestic companies joined the integrated networks of transnational corporations and , in some cases , forged strategic alliances to exploit dynamic trade and investment interlinkages .  
The new functional organizational structure , which was considered and endorsed by the special session of the Governing Council held in May 1998 , indicates that UNEP is addressing all environmental issues in a holistic and integrated manner .  
It was imperative that all governmental , public and private organizations concerned with human , social and economic development recognized community safety as a fundamental right , and that they integrated crime prevention into their mandates and activities .  
By stressing the crosscutting nature of human rights , UNDP country programmes pursue an integrated approach that recognizes the mutual dependency and complementarity of social , economic , cultural , civil and political rights .  
At the same time , it was responsible for merging conventional quantitative safeguards and more recent , qualitative safeguards into an integrated safeguards system , one that would be flexible , effective , and above all costefficient . 
Some have forged ahead and developed integrated , multisectoral approaches to sustainable development which necessitated the establishment of national focal points or coordinating bodies for the implementation of the outcomes of global conferences / summits .  
It was imperative that all governmental , public and private organizations concerned with human , social and economic development recognized community safety as a fundamental right , and that they integrated crime prevention into their mandates and activities .  
Considering ways in which early warning systems for extreme weather events might be strengthened or established in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to help address the climatechange related requirements of particularly vulnerable countries ;  
Strengthening existing [ and , where needed , establishing ] early warning systems for extreme weather events in an integrated and interdisciplinary manner to assist developing country Parties , in particular those most vulnerable to climate change ;  
In the absence of a worldwide integrated human resources database ( programmed with IMIS Release 5 ) , the tables contained in the annex to the present report are based on data derived from a primary source and two supplementary sources .  
Fourthly , he recognized that local ownership , which required not only a strategy but also effective control over the allocation of aid funds in a coherent and integrated budgetary process , was imperative for the design of adequate policies .  
In the light of the vital importance of effective and coordinated implementation of international human rights instruments , the efforts of various treaty bodies to attain an integrated and balanced administration of rights was particularly welcome .  
But its main task was to promote technical cooperation and implement integrated programmes , always bearing in mind the current technological revolution and the profound changes taking place in industrial organizations , especially transnational corporations .  
The existing local community offices will be fully integrated into the municipalities and their administrative structures to ensure the continuous provision of equal access to public services at the municipal level and the protection of community rights .  
The focus of this dialogue will be aligned with the issues that are on the agenda of this meeting , that is , need for a global partnership to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , reconfirming the need for an integrated and strategically focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 and addressing the main challenges and opportunities faced by the international community in this regard .  
In conclusion , we hope that todays very broad discussion with the family of United Nations organs and agencies , relevant institutions and Member States will be a step forward to the successful implementation of a fully integrated and broad-based subregional approach aimed at addressing the multifaceted problems confronting the region and promoting durable peace and sustainable development in West Africa .  
Thus , the sanctions , the search for a political solution , and the humanitarian and economic efforts all need to be taken as a whole and pursued as parts of an integrated strategy leading to a broad based and responsible government in Afghanistan .  
They concluded that the most promising form of prevention was to elaborate integrated , long-term strategies combining a broad range of political , economic , social and other measures to reduce or suppress the causes of conflict .  
The Council can act with a view to monitoring and ensuring compliance with current Council resolutions ; improving communication and coordination with other United Nations organs and authoritative bodies involved in the protection of civilians , particularly children ; ensuring that the post-conflict environment nurtures the rights and needs of children , including rehabilitation , which is integral to future stability and development ; and ensuring that the it takes an integrated and interdisciplinary approach and gives due consideration to the rights of children when considering peacekeeping operations .  
It refers to the realization of all the rights and freedoms recognized as human rights - civil and political rights and economic and social and cultural rights - in their totality as an integrated whole , as all these rights are interrelated and interdependent .  
In its agreed conclusions 2000 / 2 of 27 July 2000 , on the integrated and coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences , the Council invited its relevant functional commissions to consider a number of options listed in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General ( E / 2000 / 57 ) for enhancing the reviews of the major United Nations conferences and summits and to inform the Council for its consideration at its substantive session in 2001 of the outcome of their discussion .  
Accordingly , the European Union had decided to support the reforms undertaken in UNIDO since the adoption of the Business Plan at the 1997 General Conference , involving , inter alia , implementation of integrated programmes in the beneficiary countries , strengthening its field offices , and the coordination effort undertaken to enhance cohesion between United Nations agencies as well as coherent action at local level by public and private agents involved in joint projects .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
Fourthly , he recognized that local ownership , which required not only a strategy but also effective control over the allocation of aid funds in a coherent and integrated budgetary process , was imperative for the design of adequate policies .  
In his view , the most interesting aspect of the Report was the diagnosis which he summarized in three main points : the poor implementation of some policy prescriptions reflected the impossibility of religiously enforcing conditionality ; social policies in favour of the poor needed to be integrated with macroeconomic policies ; and thirdly , aid effectiveness could be enhanced by improving coordination between the Bretton Woods institutions and bilateral donors .  
The Logistics Unit intends to carry out the Secretariats intention to develop and progressively deploy additional logistics support systems to create an integrated , online field mission logistics system , providing global visibility for United Nations-owned and contingent-owned equipment as well as United Nations-owned expendable supplies and ensuring the growth , quality and security of the systems in line with the expanding needs of administrative and logistic activities in the field .  
These efforts will be pursued in an integrated manner , supported by the three global programmes against transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings and corruption , and in close coordination with the global programme against money laundering of the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention .  
They also consider that it is essential to elaborate an integrated scenario for an Arab position in the light of the agreements that will be reached at the meetings of the Arab , African and Islamic environment ministers to be held before the Rio plus 10 conference , given that the unified positions adopted by these ministerial gatherings will have a major impact at the international level .  
Pakistan believed that in years to come the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee should devote special attention to the following issues : matters relating to remote sensing , use of nuclear power sources in outer space , means of and mechanisms for strengthening inter-agency cooperation and increasing the use of space applications and services within and among entities of the United Nations system , implementation of an integrated , space-based global natural disaster management system and the physical nature and technical attributes of the geostationary orbit and of its utilization and applications .

Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
Governments recognize that the cooperative movement is highly democratic , locally autonomous but internationally integrated , and a form of organization of associations and enterprises whereby citizens themselves rely on self-help and their own responsibility to meet goals that include not only economic but social and environmental objectives , such as overcoming poverty , securing productive employment and encouraging social integration . 
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
In designing the orientation of its future work on globalization , ACC recognized the crucial role that the system , collectively , should play to build the knowledge and evidence base required to help develop effective , integrated responses capable of positively influencing globalization processes and their social impact , and of bringing real benefits to the poor .
