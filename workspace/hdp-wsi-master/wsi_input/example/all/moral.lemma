" This week , the entire world was shocked and angry , and the position of America 's moral leadership was damaged because of the terrible pictures of a small number of our US military personal abusing Iraqi prisoners , " Clark said , responding on behalf of the Democrats to Bush 's weekly radio address .  
Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .  
Falungong came into being and spread .  Li Hongzhi 's crooked reasoning and heretical ideas were believed by many people .  This is because Falungong and Li Hongzhi took advantage of the moral vacuum , knowing that some of us led a life devoid of meaning and our ideals and beliefs wavered .  
Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of youths and juveniles to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China .  
and put the ideological and political education in the primary position of quality education .  It is imperative to promote the integration of the students ' moral , intellectual , physical , aesthetic , and labor technical education with social practice ;  
The ministry points out that with the focus on improving teachers ' moral characters and work styles , we should realistically strengthen the construction of the contingent of teachers and make ceaseless efforts to improve teachers ' ideological and political quality and professional ability .  
In view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
It has put forward the three anti-corruption work patterns of cadres ' honest self-governing , investigation and handling of cases of discipline violation and broken law , and redressing unhealthy tendencies in government and industry .  It has upheld the establishment of the two lines of defense of moral thinking and Party discipline and law , based on education and focused on keeping a lookout over the majority of Party members and cadres , and using strong legal standards for the small number of corrupt elements .  
In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out : " Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of young people to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China . "  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
Still more sinister , Li Hongzhi took advantage of the masses ' concern , hatred , and worry over corruption in society to pin the blame for " the great catastrophe for mankind " onto universal moral turpitude , in a bid to thus strengthen the power of his fallacious reasoning in confusing and misleading people .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
It also means and is most crucial to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party , comprehensively implement both the Party 's guiding principle on education and the Central Military Commission 's requirements on running military schools , and maintain the original nature of these schools . " producing skilled students " means to foster high-quality military professionals with a comprehensive training in moral , academic , military and physical aspects and with superior qualities in all other aspects .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
The entire process of Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration has told us that although many factors led to his reduction from a high-ranking leading cadre to a typical corrupt element , it can not be denied that a major reason for Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration was our failure to stress education , our failure to maintain tight control , and our failure to exercise close supervision .  
The Cheng Kejie case has exposed the weak links in our work , yet it has also given us a profound warning concerning our work : It is necessary to severely punish corrupt elements ; yet viewing from the angle of resisting corruption and guarding against moral degeneration , it is of a greater importance to impose strict education , strict control , and strict supervision on party-member leading cadres .  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
We must carefully formulate and seriously carry out a guiding plan for ethical building , blend the basic moral concept demands into the relevant laws and regulations and the various specific policies , and into the various items of social management , and continually promote the formation and perfection of the system of socialist ideology and ethics .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
Their twisted and fallacious theories create great psychological pressure on many people , not only driving their followers to the path of death , making their wives and children walk out on them , breaking up the families , and ruining lives , but also seriously undermining public order , violating the law and normal moral standards , infringing on basic human rights and freedom , and lead to anti-humanity , anti-social , and anti-science crimes .  
What stirred Peng Qin deeply at a later time was the moral lessons given by two former " Falungong " practitioners on the basis of their own experiences , whom the provincial reeducation-through-labor center had released before the due date .  Ever since then , Peng Qin started to calm down and do some serious thinking .  Little by little , she recalled the path that she had covered over the previous three years ;  
They should spend more time on studying than entertaining for social purposes , and should pay more attention to making contributions than considering their personal gains .  Each of them should strive to be a person who is pure , lofty , moral , free from vulgar interests and beneficial to the people .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .  
Let us put it in another way .  Man 's various imaginations about the afterlife are actually based on this life ; therefore , if an afterlife theory totally negates the value and meaning of this life , totally runs counter to man 's essential common sense in this life , and totally violates man 's moral principles in this life , then it can easily fall into a ridiculous and weird circle , and can easily be used for conducting all kinds of activities that bring harm to man .  
Nevertheless , all orthodox religions have , during the process of their missionary work , gradually blended man 's rationality with his common sense ; and by blending the two , these religions have been able to make their religious propositions more rational and more humane , and have thus played an increasingly important role in man 's this life and even become the source of cultures and moral principles of certain nations .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
can we crush the arrogance of criminal elements and boost the moral of the masses ; can we implement the various measures for comprehensive management of public security in real earnest ; and can we effectively ensure the healthy economic and social development .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .  
While instituting and developing a socialist legal system suited to the socialist market economy , we need to institute a moral system commensurate with it , and be good at merging the basic , important moral requirements into relevant laws and regulations and into various kinds of management in society , so as to ceaselessly promote the formation and perfection of the socialist ideological and ethical system .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's lofty thinking and character of selflessly dedicating himself , devoting himself to his assignment , not being concerned for personal gains and losses , and not being moved by fame and money ; and to self-consciously subject themselves to and serve the general interests of reform and construction , nurture good morality and sentiment , establish lofty goals , and maintain the steadfastness , faithfulness , and moral integrity of a revolutionary soldier .  
the spirit of pressing forward in the face of difficulties indomitably and relentlessly , the spirit of working hard and seeking solid results , and the spirit of being indifferent to fame and fortune and making selfless contributions ; continuously enhance their moral and ideological quality and their scientific , cultural , and technological quality ; and strive to become workers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin also expressed ardent hopes on college students throughout the country .  He hoped that they will become people with a lofty ideal and people loving the motherland , will become people seeking the truth and daring to make innovations , and will become people with both moral integrity and ability , people being healthily developed in all aspects , people with a broad vision and also being broad-minded , and people who can integrate what they have learned with what they will do and can work in a down-to-earth manner .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
The General Principles of the Education Law also explicitly require that " the state conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for those who receive education , and conduct ideal , moral , discipline , legal , national defense , and ethnic unity education . "  
They should stick to a lofty moral standard and the revolutionary spirit , keep the masses firmly in mind , struggle with painstaking efforts , align their personal interests with public interests , be concerned about and protect the interests of officers and soldiers and make great efforts to realize the Party 's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
and how to implement General Secretary Jiang 's principle of dunning the country by virtue , satisfactorily unify efforts to run the army according to law with efforts to step up ideological and moral education among officers and men and , while enhancing the legal system concept and moral quality of officers and men , enhance the management level of army units , raise the consciousness of officers and men in loving the army , learning military skills , and strictly observing discipline , and so on .  
Leaders and political institutions at all levels should , in accordance with the criteria , select promising soldiers with outstanding moral and military integrity and excellent and crucial soldiers , heroic models and exemplary figures in preparing for war , performing their duty and carrying out significant tasks , so as to allow this policy to be an award and a guide in further arousing enthusiasm in loving the military and learning military skills among the majority of soldiers .  
On several occasions , Comrade Jiang Zemin has also exhorted the whole party that party cadres , especially leading and senior cadres , should pass on their fine thinking , moral character , and personnel experiences in working hard for the party and people to their children and should strive to train the latter into people with a noble ethos and rich knowledge and that they should not take advantage of their positions and powers to seek illegitimate gain for their children .  
He further hoped that the quality education base for youths and the science and technology hall will extend the quality education of schools and allow every middle and elementary school student to be trained and nurtured in creative thinking , willpower and moral character , physical health , environmental protection sense , and capability in practical living .  
It is necessary to deeply study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , conduct more intensive education on the correct world and life outlook and correct values among law enforcement and police officers and judicial personnel , and make greater effort to build a high-quality law enforcement contingent with firm political stand , profession proficiency , good work style , and noble moral standards of being honest and uncorrupt  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
Liu Yunshan stressed : Over the past 80 years , our party has united with and rallied millions upon millions of people not only with scientific theories , correct line and magnificent goals , but also with the dynamic ethical character and moral integrity of the Communists . Since reform and opening up , and the convocation of the 14th CPC National Congress in particular , the CPC Central Committee has persisted in taking economic construction as the center .  
Over the past few years , thanks to the joint efforts exerted by the entire party and the whole society , the essential aspect of the style of thinking and moral qualities of the whole society is active , healthy and progressive .  Gratifying changes have taken place in the mental outlook of our people .  
The fine tradition of the Chinese nation and our revolutionary tradition have been carried forward under the new historical conditions .  Patriotism , collectivism , socialist concepts and socialist moral practice have become the essential aspect of our people 's mental world .  This conforms to the moral standardization of the development of our socialist economy and the common pursuit of all members of our society .  
New interpersonal relationships and healthy , scientific and civilized way of life are taking shape .  The strengthening of our ideological and moral building has become our powerful political advantage that enables our party to lead the people to overcome various kinds of difficulties and dangers .  It has become an important spiritual force that enables us to seize the opportunities , speed up development and promote all-round progress of the society .  
The fundamental task for developing the socialist culture lies in cultivating citizens from generation to generation who have lofty ideals , moral integrity , a better education and a good sense of discipline .  We should persevere in arming the people with scientific theories , guiding the people with correct public opinions , molding the people with noble minds , and inspiring the people with superior works .

More importantly , they should make unremitting efforts in a down-to-earth manner to realize the party 's basic program for the current stage and put their heart into each single piece of work now .  
To practice the requirement of representing the orientation of the development of China 's advanced culture , we must enhance the building of socialist spiritual civilization , persistently educate the people with Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , effectively implement the strategy of relying on science and education for national regeneration , promote the enhancement of the ideological and moral integrity and scientific and cultural attainments of the whole nation .

The " Declaration " calls on developed countries to consider their moral obligation and duty to bridge the growing " digital divide " and to play a positive role in promoting international cooperation , mutual understanding , and peace .  
Modern human society is made up of numerous rules , and wars , as a normal human activity , have always been constrained by these rules ; certain kinds of warfare have always been prohibited .  The reason human beings have evolved from their primitive state to create nations and societies is that they have this kind of moral and compelling laws and rules and regulations .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
All party-member leading cadres , especially high and middle-level cadres , should draw a profound lesson from Cheng Kejie 's case on discipline and law breaches , persist in paying attention to study , politics , and healthy trends , and firmly foster a correct world outlook , outlook on life , and the concept of value .  They must be able to stand the test of temptation and maintain forever the ideal , conviction and moral virtue of communist party members .

Even if we believe that his theory is overly simplistic and has moral relativistic or moral equivalent tendencies if applied to the real world , we must still acknowledge that there is some truth to it and that it serves as a valuable theoretical reference as we ponder today 's international politics .  
With regard to the work contents , priority should be given to grasping the ideological and moral education and the training to foster their ability in practice and , through launching healthy , useful , lively , and specific activities , strive to let the patriotic , collective , and socialist ideas be deeply rooted in their young hearts so as to gradually form fine morality and lofty sentiments in their daily conduct , and to constantly enhance their ability in mental and physical work and skills in adapting themselves to society .

We must actively launch legal system education and universal legal work to protect the old people 's legal rights and vigorously amplify the Chinese nation 's traditional virtue of respecting , providing for , and assist the old , and we must work hard to further increase every citizen 's legal awareness and moral quality toward protecting the old .  
We resolutely oppose bureaucracy and formalism .  We should persist in raising the quality of residents and the level of civilization in communities as our main objective , strive to build modern urban communities marked by fine environments , good order , quality service , and successful management .  We should also form a moral standard in communities that respects the advanced , helps each other in the spirit of solidarity , upholds the good , suppresses the bad , and aggressively makes progress so as to achieve coordinate development in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
The " Suite of Songs on the Morals of Military Men , " which was organized and created by the General Political Department , has rapidly become popular in military camps north and south of the great river , the frontiers , and islands , and officers and men have received education on our military 's fine traditions and the moral standards of military personnel in the art forms that they love .  
Under this situation filled with opportunities , competition , and challenges , if our judges fail to pay attention to improving their study and enhancing their level and fail to pay attention to updating their knowledge in order to heighten their political , legal , moral , and professional quality as quickly as possible , they will not be able to meet the requirements for the development of judicial work and will be eliminated in the end .  
While carrying out ideological and political work , the people 's courts at various levels should ceaselessly strengthen education in communist ideals .

We must hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism , combine the advanced and extensive requirements , and strive to give play to the united front 's positive role in advancing cultural construction ; at the same time , we must strengthen ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural construction within the united front , and promote the firm establishment of common ideals and moral pillars in society as a whole and the improvement of the whole nation 's scientific and cultural qualities .  
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
We must uphold economic development as the center , and integrate spiritual civilization construction work with city and rural development work , as well as with business work for all industries and trades .  We must put efforts into raising the ideological and moral quality of people , and also their science and cultural quality , thus providing spiritual motivation and ideological assurance for modernization construction .  
In the training and management of the athletes , serious attention should be paid to scientifically training their abilities in physique and athletic contests , and heightening their cultural level , mental quality , and moral standard ;  
Along with the development of the socialist market economy , the law governing the exchange of commodities will easily produce corrosive influences in social political life and people 's spiritual realm , give rise to the disregard of moral principles in pursuit of profits and the exchange of power for money , and lead to the weakening of the state and collective awareness and the spirit of mutual assistance and dedication .  
enlarge the coverage of education and pay special attention to the ideological and moral education and guidance for the adolescent ; have the education aim at more definite objectives and practical results ; integrate the uniformity of propaganda and education of the Marxist theory and the ideology and morality on building socialism with Chinese characteristics with the plurality of characteristics and demands of different social groups , and integrate the theory of propaganda and education on ideal , faith , ideology , and morality with the practice of the daily work and life of the masses ;  
In a written speech , Luo Guojie , professor at the Chinese People 's University , said : This thinking is an important theoretical development of socialist politics , ethics , and law , and it is bound to practically produce a positive influence on social stability and moral practice in our country and to greatly accelerate our drive for socialist modernization .  
He said : " Running the country with virtue " and instituting an ideological and moral system adapting to the developing socialist market economy are a long-term strategic task and a huge project of systems engineering , and this calls for joint efforts by people in various circles , continuously studying new situations in practice , and summing up fresh experiences .  
He held : In carrying out moral construction , we must persistently guide ourselves with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the important concept of the " three represents " and firmly grasp various important links influencing the formation of people 's thinking and moral ideas ; in addition , we must make and implement concrete guiding plans and integrate the requirements of the basic moral ideas into relevant laws , regulations , and specific policies and into various social controls .  
Through these chats about normal , everyday matters , we found that before becoming obsessed with " Falungong , " many female members had been good employees at work , as well as good mothers , wives and daughters at home ; it was only after being poisoned by Li Hongzhi that they became lost and estranged from their moral sense , sensibilities and affections , and committed some illegal acts .  
Correct ideological theories and high-technology knowledge were used to arm the minds of the troops .  Great efforts were made to promote the spirit of making unswerving efforts for the realization of socialist modernization as advocated by Chairman Jiang Zemin , and prompt the vast number of officers and servicemen to become revolutionary soldiers with a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good education , and a sense of discipline , and make this their noble pursuit and action .  
All social circles should greatly promote and carry forward the fine moral and conduct of helping the weak and disabled , giving relief to those in danger and in difficulty , and respecting the old and cherishing the young , thus making greater contributions to the comprehensive economic and social progress in our country in the 10th Five-Year Plan .  
It is important to vigorously carry forward and develop the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation ; launch a society-wide moral education on the need to respect , provide for , and assist the old ; and to give form to a sound common practice of respecting , caring for , and helping the elderly in the entire society in combination with the activity of creating civilized communities , civilized villages and towns , and civilized families .  
As 80 percent of the people going online are under the age of 35 , the network is exerting a vigorous influence on the adolescents .  Therefore , it seems particularly important to establish moral standards , advocate moral integrity and self-discipline , and create a healthy , civilized , and honest cultural environment in the network space through positive guidance .  
They pointed out : The key to building a contingent of highly qualified personnel for political and legal work lies in personnel .  We must firmly control entry and ensure smooth exit and must work hard to build a contingent of clean and honest personnel known for a firm political stand , professional proficiency , a fine style , and moral integrity .  
The advanced character of the party should be eventually reflected from each party member 's specific words and deeds .  Only when each party member and cadre are strict with themselves , always place themselves under the supervision of party organizations and the masses , keep tempering and cultivating themselves in party spirit , raise their political consciousness and moral standards , and maintain strict standards in work , daily life , and social intercourse will they be able to ward off the corrosive influence and never become corrupt .  
The rules of the market economy can not be established without a complete legal system , nor can they be established without effective moral support and constraints ; this is because the law and morality regulate people 's orientation of conduct and value and imperceptibly become social order and the self-discipline norm acknowledged by most people in society ; the law and morality interact , promote each other , and play an important role in ensuring the normal operation of the market .  
* To be a person who has deep love of our mother country and is committed to the development of the mainland as well as Hong Kong ; * To be biliterate and trilingual ; * To be a person with immense and extensive knowledge , independent thinking , creativity and enthusiasm ; and * To be a teacher who is caring and eager to serve our community and a person with lofty ideal and high moral standards , who is ready to shoulder the onus in the education of our younger generation . "  
( d ) The BA , with most of its members drawn from a wide cross section of the community , is already responsible for monitoring the electronic media .  It also has the statutory powers to ensure that the television and radio programmes comply with the moral standard generally accepted by the community , hence , there is no need to set up a separate monitoring committee .  
The Bill provides for the membership of the Council to be drawn from a wide cross-section of the community , including medical practitioners , social workers , lawyers and persons who are associated with religion .  This is to enable the Council to consider wholly the medical , social , moral , ethical and legal issues arising from reproductive technology .  
To lead a healthy and balanced life-style , students should have an all-round education , encompassing moral , intellectual , physical , social and aesthetic aspects , the Director of Education , Mrs Fanny Law , said .  
Notable amongst the approved projects for youths-at-risk are the $ 2.5 million proposal to be organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups featuring preventive education and guidance for 2 500 high-risk youths from primary and secondary schools , as well as from youth centres in Tsuen Wan and Kwai Tsing districts ; and the $ 2.3 million project by the Hong Kong Christian Service targeting at 3 000 youths-at-risk , including school drop-outs and unemployed young people , with a view to minimising their exposure to social and moral danger which could lead to substance abuse .  
In Hong Kong , the policy objective of enhancing workplace safety and health is to help business and the duty holders meet their legal , moral and social obligations in reducing work-related injuries and diseases .  The strategy used is preventive rather than curative , promotional and educational rather than prosecution-oriented .  
In this connection , will the Government inform this Council whether it has considered including civic education in the core curricula of secondary and primary schools , so as to foster good virtues and positive values among students , thereby developing Hong Kong into a community that attaches equal importance to moral and intellectual development ; if so , of the specific timetable for the implementation of such a plan ; if not , the reasons for that ?  
" As we hail the internet as a powerful communication tool , the insidious infiltration of unwanted propaganda and pornography into the family , and the controversy surrounding the free circulation of intellectual properties have raised ethical , moral and legal issues .  
" As RT is a complex and sensitive subject involving wide-ranging medical , social , moral , ethical and legal implications , it is no easy task but with efforts coming from all concerned parties , the PCRT is able to moving closer to putting in place the proposed regulatory framework .  
Under such circumstances , it is too difficult and too demanding to follow the set of high moral standards of Confucianism and be " filial , respectful to the elders , loyal and truthful " .  
Under such circumstances , it is too difficult and too demanding to follow the set of high moral standards of Confucianism and be ' filial , respectful to the elders , loyal and truthful ' .  
" The Government has expressed grave concern over this incident .  We consider that such an act has damaged our social and moral values .  This is not acceptable and should be condemned by the society and subject to legal sanction .  
Organised by the Curriculum Development Institute ( CDI ) of the Education Department , the Knowledge Fair covered such main themes as development of critical thinking and creativity through learning activities , assessment for learning to improve learning and teaching , and school-based curriculum development .  The four key tasks , namely project learning , reading to learn , moral and civic education , and information technology for interactive learning were also included .  
" We have attached great importance to the moral and healthy development of our students .  Through a variety of learning activities , students are provided with amble opportunities to develop positive values and attitudes , healthy lifestyles and critical thinking skills to handle the problems arising from their daily encounters and social issues , " an EMB spokesman said .  
It stressed that both leaders were gratified by the continuous development in political , economic and technical relations between their countries . They shared identical ideals and aspirations , the communique stated , believing as they did that the foundation of traditional friendship , based on high moral principles and fraternal solidarity , was both firm and enduring . The king and the president reaffirmed the common cause of their countries and peoples in upholding peace , freedom and human rights and opposing all forms of aggression , oppression and prejudice .  
This great tradition is seen in the annual increase in the number of overseas Chinese visitors , their augmented investment in productive enterprises here , their insistent and courageous resistance to Chinese Communist united front temptations , and especially in their active moral and physical support of the government in their motherland during the last two months . "  
This sums up events in the past century when millions of Chinese suffered under the experiments of various political systems , including constitutional monarchy , socialism and Communism . During the past 30 years , detente and power politics have dominated the world arena . As a result , justice , truth and moral courage have been obscured , and adverse tides have continued to buffet the nation . With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
The motive force behind progress is the pursuit of wealth . But even if people are well off , if they lack viable moral standards , then unrest and criminal behavior may arise . So we must set up a stable , ethical , harmonious society in which wealth is evenly distributed .  
In the first of the two pictures titled " Late to School , " we see a pupil standing in front of the blackboard as punishment , his twisted , piqued expression contrasting interestingly with the stiff , upright characters of the moral injunctions written on the board behind him .  
The result has been a change from unitary to pluralistic values , from closed ways of thinking to open ones , from moral and ethical considerations as a prime determinant of human relations to utilitarian and materialistic interests , from a simple and impoverished way of life to more prosperous and complex lifestyles .  
His words illustrate the type of thinking that lay behind the art of embroidery in ancient times . The use of celestial bodies and aspects of nature as designs for clothing reflects the harmony and fusion of man and nature . The flowery fowl is the brightly colored pheasant , the aquatic grasses express cleanliness , fire stands for illumination , and rice represents nourishment . Together the patterns are a symbol of the moral ideal of government , of concern over the destiny of mankind and compassion for the people .  
A : I only focus on how to do the job that I am doing at the current time . I have never considered the problem of future office . Because I personally believe that the Kuomintang has many talented people , the Kuomintang should select someone of accomplishment and moral fortitude to serve as the president 's main assistant .  
If textbooks can be diversified and a certain standard of quality maintained , so that people have more choice , then education will be more lively and multifarious , and that will be of greater assistance in a child 's mental and moral growth .  
This Chinese Hamlet is a story of emotional entanglements and moral dilemmas , because Chinese drama is strong on narrative , weak on emotional outpourings , and depends more on beautiful literary language than on philosophical content .  
For example , the Tun Hwa Radio fleet , the first to make use of radio communication , was established three years ago as a pilot project of the Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications . It upholds a policy of hiring only drivers of outstanding moral character and of employing not a single driver with a bad record so that passengers can feel at ease about riding a cab at any hour .  
Finally , let me speak of the moral character of roosters . The Han-shih wai-chuan ( Han Ying 's Illustrations of the Didactic Application of the Classic of Songs ) points to the five characteristics of the cock : " Wearing a hat like a scholar , it is scholarly ; with claws that pierce the flesh , it is martial ; attacking when confronted by an enemy , it is bold ; calling out when it finds food , it is benevolent ; standing guard at night without fail , it is trustworthy . "  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
The Old Confucian is aroused and makes frequent passes at the girl . They dance and dance , but all of a sudden , the slender maiden turns into a black mist and then into a black serpent , scaring the old man away . Maybe the story has a profound moral : Do n't linger over the transitory beauty in front of your eyes , because it may very well be a serpent in disguise .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
Examples are Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi in the Han dynasty story The Peacocks Fly Southeast ; the Song dynasty patriotic poet Lu You and Tang Wan ; or Shen Sanbai and Yunniang in the Qing-dynasty Six Chapters of a Floating Life . The path of love for people in olden times was often rocky and strewn with pitfalls , and hedged about by an ossified social order and moral code . When the poet Lu You was 20 years old he married his cousin Tang Wan , his mother 's niece .  
People are often bedazzled by the earth-shaking " sacrifices " of romantic love , but Ko believes that classical love , which " succeeds " by day-to-day effort , morning and night , is even more special . This is the deep and subtle spirit of " joy without excess . " Perhaps this is why in the West there is the saying , " marriage is the tomb of love , " whereas the Chinese , in a society built on the Confucian moral code , feel that " marriage is the beginning of love . "  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
" The only purpose of financial operations is to turn a profit . There 's no such thing as moral or immoral , and no such thing as it being fair or unfair to hardworking individual countries or firms , " says Ding Kung-wha , highlighting the pragmatic and unsentimental nature of the financial world .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
Huang feels that stories designed to make a moral point are oversimplified , and real life is much more complicated . What he likes is to capture human nature , as in the Chinese opera classic The Fourth Son Visiting His Mother , which retains its emotional impact today because the son is torn between family and country , wife and mother .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
" For fear of children getting ill , one ca n't simply deny the existence of germs , " says Wu Wu-tien . In his view , only by " immunizing " children-presenting them with a realistic view with both positive and negative examples , and so training their capacity for moral discernment and judgement-can one give them a mental rock to hold fast to when faced with all kinds of temptations , so that they are not easily led astray .  
Such questions are ignored , as are the intangible emotional aspects of morality , such as self-esteem , self-respect , caring for others , and even a sense of shame , a sense of guilt , moral courage and so on . Thus morality can easily become superficial or even a complete sham , adopted for show but not practiced in reality . In other words , under these circumstances moral actions never advance beyond the stage of " heteronomous morality " [ imposed by outside authority ] , and are unlikely to come from the heart .  
Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
The Taipei District Court ruled that although the topic of Ho Ya-wei 's report-about how Huang Chao-fu had spent NT $ 20 million in his first campaign as a KMT nominee for the legislature but received only 200 votes-could be described as " fair game . . . its sarcasm virtually dripped from the page . . . Because this affected the reputation of the plaintiff 's private moral character , the defendant was clearly acting maliciously . "  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
In great universities , all the various ideas co-exist : the philosophic schools of materialism and idealism , the aesthetic schools of realism and romanticism , the economic schools of mercantilism and laissez-faire , the ethical schools of moral purpose and utilitarianism , and the cosmological schools of optimism and negativism . That is why universities are ' universal , ' " declared Tsai .  
Laozi and Confucius both emerged late in the Spring and Autumn period , in a time of frequent warfare when the system of moral education through ritual and music of the Zhou dynasty ( 11th century-256 BC ) had collapsed , and the nobility had abandoned themselves to a life of wanton extravagance supported by ruthless exploitation of the common people .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
Lee has been steeped all his life in traditional Chinese morality , and has always sought to inject his personal ideas into his movies , " teaching a moral lesson in a fun way , " as the old Chinese saying goes . Many commentators have criticized Lee for being preachy , doctrinaire , and relying too much on stage techniques in his movies . Some even accuse him of sensationalism . Lee answers with a disarming , " That 's me , alright !  
Ko 's own attitude towards the Song dynasty is a mixture of love and hate . Those deeply introspective literary types with their lofty moral standards produced artistic achievements of the highest order . Yet they also seemed " over-civilized , " devoid of any streak of wildness , as if lacking part of what makes us human .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
In Christian culture the mother is a sacred figure , symbolizing purity , charity , and tolerance . In traditional Chinese culture , by contrast , mothers not only were supposed to have certain moral virtues , but were also bearers of heavy burdens of pain and suffering . A mother was fated to cry endless tears and submit to countless indignities .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
These ideas affected the ways in which writers chose to present knights-errant in their novels . Says Lin , " At the most fundamental level , knights-errant are supposed to embody moral virtue . So while a writer might allow his hero to be less than perfect in some small ways , he will always stand fast when faced with an issue or choice of consequence . "  
Courageously facing marriage As a sociologist well aware of the rising divorce rate and the unwillingness of young people to even get hitched because they have seen too many unhappy couples , Hsueh gives some practical advice . While people should make as serious a commitment to marriage as they do to a career , as in a career one can change course or start again . When a marriage really can not be xxxxsustained , divorce should be a socially acceptable alternative , and does not symbolize personal failure or moral bankruptcy .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
Will the evolution of food serve as a metaphor for the whole relationship ? Recently all the major political parties in Taiwan have been at war over the issue of public referenda , amidst dark hints from the United States and overt threats from the PRC . One can not help but sigh . When we were small , " recovering the mainland " was the unquestionable mission of the nation , and " pacifism " was a betrayal of the country and an evasion of moral responsibility .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
It strongly urged the international community to continue its moral and material assistance to South Africans in order to help create stable conditions for the rapid and peaceful attainment of a new democratic and nonracial South Africa .  
The investigation of human rights violations in the world and the moral sanctioning of regimes responsible for grave and systematic violations was a great achievement by the United Nations human rights system and should be maintained and improved .  
Requests once again the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all humanitarian , material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly independent and emerging States so as to enable them to consolidate their political independence and achieve genuine economic independence ;  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .  
It is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed universal human rights rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law .  
A decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity ; in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man 's historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit .  
But what would it have been like had the United Nations not existed to channel activities for peace , to oversee the post-war period and the cold war , to give its moral sanction to the emancipation of peoples , to coordinate assistance for economic and social development and to set a moral standard and order relations among nations and human beings ?  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
The generation that enters the year 2000 faced with a perceptible crisis of ethical and moral values must renew with more vigour than ever its commitment to society , guided always by its convictions and never by considerations of convenience , respecting human rights and struggling with all its force for the perennial principles of justice , freedom and equality for all .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
It is therefore essential that the international community defend the peace process , give it political , economic and moral support and encourage the parties concerned to work for a genuine peace based on mutual understanding , cooperation , security , dignity and respect for the legitimate rights of all .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies . 
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles that deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , etc . focusing on scientific literacy , human moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic societies and pluri-cultural societies .  
Broad parliamentary support would be required to change the legal situation , especially in view of strong opposition from the Catholic Church , whose moral authority had been enhanced by its defence of human rights under the military dictatorship .

Because of their narrow education values , lopsided views on quality , and outmoded notions on talent , the education department and parents tend to one-sidedly pursue enrollment quotas and overlook students ' psychological quality and moral character and their disciplinary and legal education , thus placing the value of course grades above human values and replacing the objective of education with the goal of human and social development .

Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of youths and juveniles to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China .  
and put the ideological and political education in the primary position of quality education .  It is imperative to promote the integration of the students ' moral , intellectual , physical , aesthetic , and labor technical education with social practice ;  
The ministry points out that with the focus on improving teachers ' moral characters and work styles , we should realistically strengthen the construction of the contingent of teachers and make ceaseless efforts to improve teachers ' ideological and political quality and professional ability .  
In view of the development of the objective situation and the change in the ranks of workers and staff members , we should do in-depth and meticulous ideological and political work among them and keep improving their ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities .  
We must solidly and deeply launch the mass campaign of the exploration and construction of spiritual civilization and comprehensively conduct promotion and education , among all of the people , on scientific perspective on the world and methodology .  We must form a healthy atmosphere , in the entire society , which opposes superstition and ignorance and resists various false reasoning and heretical ideas .  We must continuously improve the masses ' ideological and moral levels and establish good spiritual habits .  
Therefore , with Marxism as the guide and the training of people who have lofty ideas , moral integrity , education , and a sense of discipline as the goal , we must develop a national , scientific , and popular culture , which is oriented to modernization , the world , and the future , and concentrate efforts on improving the ideological and ethical quality as well as scientific and cultural quality of the entire Chinese nation .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
It has put forward the three anti-corruption work patterns of cadres ' honest self-governing , investigation and handling of cases of discipline violation and broken law , and redressing unhealthy tendencies in government and industry .

In his speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out : " Correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of young people to enable them to achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in China . "  
Deng Xiaoping also called for fostering new people with " a lofty ideal , moral integrity , good educational background , and a strong sense of discipline " and took this as the fundamental objective of developing socialist spiritual civilization .  He also stressed that ideals and the sense of discipline are the most important among all the four criteria .  
In the subjective aspect , a small number of communists and party cadres became corrupt and degenerated because they did not study , did not stress politics , and then began to vacillate in their ideal and belief .  Therefore , to effectively stop corruption , in addition to improving the legal system and the supervision mechanisms , it is also necessary to enhance political , ideological , and moral education .  
As we have deepened the educational structural reform and promoted the quality education in a comprehensive way , distinctive features are formed in moral education , foreign language , computer science , special education , and advanced vocational education .  
At the UN human rights meetings , the United States provoked confrontation and disputes on many occasions out of certain domestic political needs and also its stubborn mentality of " moral imperialism " and the so-called international strategy of national egoism .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
Since our army is an important force for building the socialist spiritual civilization and an advanced group composed of outstanding young people from all walks of life , it must conscientiously uphold the requirement for the advanced quality in ideological , moral , and cultural construction .  
The corrosive effects of decadent thinking and culture have particularly impeded the forming and establishment of a correct world outlook among officers and men , distorted some people 's outlook on life and concept of values as well as led to problems and deviation in moral quality and life pursuits among them .  
Still more sinister , Li Hongzhi took advantage of the masses ' concern , hatred , and worry over corruption in society to pin the blame for " the great catastrophe for mankind " onto universal moral turpitude , in a bid to thus strengthen the power of his fallacious reasoning in confusing and misleading people .  
The " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " firmly takes hold of this critical topic , retells in artistic form that officials and soldiers like to hear and see the brilliant history in which the people 's military united to struggle under the Party 's leadership , reflects the fundamental moral requirements for revolutionary military professionals in the new phase and displays the vigorous and progressive spiritual outlook of modern military professionals , having developed a new thinking on reforming the military 's ideological and political education .  
Adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military , improving the competitiveness of winning high-tech wars in the future , loving and devoting oneself to the motherland , making painstaking efforts , officials and soldiers being friendly and loving each other , and maintaining the revolutionary moral integrity and so on are all critical issues that Chairman Jiang has been paying close attention to and has repeatedly laid stress on in recent years .  
By learning and singing these songs , we aim to strengthen the spiritual backbone of revolutionary military professionals , to improve the moral quality of the broad number of officials and soldiers , and to enable them to receive education , to purify their spiritual world , mold their attitude and improve their conscientiousness through aesthetic educational activities conducted in a way that influences their environment .  
Under the conditions of promoting reform and opening up and being in the ruling position , our party must constantly resist all kinds of corrosive influence and culture .  Therefore , to the broad masses of party members and cadres , it is particularly important to strengthen the building of spiritual civilization and continuously raise their ideological , moral , scientific and cultural qualities .  
We must persist in " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each " and firmly promote the building of spiritual civilization while grasping the building of material civilization .  We should use Marxism to firmly occupy the ideological and cultural front , vigorously strengthen education on developing a fine party style and building a clean and honest government , and construct an ideological and moral defensive line to repel the corrupting influence and guard against degeneration .  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
Each region must pay thorough attention to developing spiritual and cultural products and healthy entertainment activities that have the ability to imperceptibly influence people 's ideological views and moral sentiments so as to allow the masses to achieve enlightenment and mold their sentiments in a relaxed and happy atmosphere .  
It also means and is most crucial to hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party , comprehensively implement both the Party 's guiding principle on education and the Central Military Commission 's requirements on running military schools , and maintain the original nature of these schools . " producing skilled students " means to foster high-quality military professionals with a comprehensive training in moral , academic , military and physical aspects and with superior qualities in all other aspects .  
Through military training , students have enhanced concept of national defense and sense of organization and discipline , raised their ideological and political consciousness , received education on patriotism and collectivism , promoted their all-round development of morality , intelligence , and physique , and laid down a firm ideological and political foundation for becoming a generation of new people with lofty ideals , moral integrity , education and a sense of discipline .  Military training of students has cultivated high quality reserve people for national defense .  
The entire process of Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration has told us that although many factors led to his reduction from a high-ranking leading cadre to a typical corrupt element , it can not be denied that a major reason for Cheng Kejie 's moral degeneration was our failure to stress education , our failure to maintain tight control , and our failure to exercise close supervision .  
The Cheng Kejie case has exposed the weak links in our work , yet it has also given us a profound warning concerning our work : It is necessary to severely punish corrupt elements ; yet viewing from the angle of resisting corruption and guarding against moral degeneration , it is of a greater importance to impose strict education , strict control , and strict supervision on party-member leading cadres .  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
Selecting officers from the grassroots with both working abilities , moral integrity and outstanding political achievements and placing them in correct posts is an important guide in stimulating the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres in making achievements and strengthening the ideological stability of grassroots units .  Stimulating their enthusiasm merely by promotion and position transfer is not only unrealistic , however , but also can not root out problems .  If the right cadre as the proper exemplary figure is promoted , this promotion will stimulate the enthusiasm of a large number of cadres .  
These spirits are the centralized embodiment of the proletarian ideals and conviction , moral values , heroic mettle and strong wills .  They derive from the great ideal of communism , arming with Marxist and Leninist theories and the fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  They are also important components of our excellent traditions and political advantages .  
We must carefully formulate and seriously carry out a guiding plan for ethical building , blend the basic moral concept demands into the relevant laws and regulations and the various specific policies , and into the various items of social management , and continually promote the formation and perfection of the system of socialist ideology and ethics .  
The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission was rich in substance .  Take the question of honesty and self-discipline for example .  While upholding the existing regulations , the session put forward , in line with the basic rules of the socialist market economy , six moral requirements on leading cadres to ensure that they are honest in performing official duties .  
Their twisted and fallacious theories create great psychological pressure on many people , not only driving their followers to the path of death , making their wives and children walk out on them , breaking up the families , and ruining lives , but also seriously undermining public order , violating the law and normal moral standards , infringing on basic human rights and freedom , and lead to anti-humanity , anti-social , and anti-science crimes .  
What stirred Peng Qin deeply at a later time was the moral lessons given by two former " Falungong " practitioners on the basis of their own experiences , whom the provincial reeducation-through-labor center had released before the due date .  Ever since then , Peng Qin started to calm down and do some serious thinking .  Little by little , she recalled the path that she had covered over the previous three years ;  
They should spend more time on studying than entertaining for social purposes , and should pay more attention to making contributions than considering their personal gains .  Each of them should strive to be a person who is pure , lofty , moral , free from vulgar interests and beneficial to the people .  
With good moral qualities , people will be able to consciously uphold justice and eliminate evil and carry forward the good and punish the bad .  All this is conducive to establishing a good social practice of pursuing the lofty and encouraging the advanced , ensuring a sound progress of socialist market economy , and giving a push to the improvement of the overall national quality .  
On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine compositions of the thought of " rule by virtue " in ancient China and discarding the bad portions of the thought , the new type of " rule by virtue " takes serving the people as its core and collectivism as its principle , attaches importance to the functions of moral education and transformation with moral education , stresses the importance of selecting and promoting cadres with political integrity and professional ability , and enables leading cadres and state functionaries to play an exemplary role .  
Let us put it in another way .  Man 's various imaginations about the afterlife are actually based on this life ; therefore , if an afterlife theory totally negates the value and meaning of this life , totally runs counter to man 's essential common sense in this life , and totally violates man 's moral principles in this life , then it can easily fall into a ridiculous and weird circle , and can easily be used for conducting all kinds of activities that bring harm to man .  
Nevertheless , all orthodox religions have , during the process of their missionary work , gradually blended man 's rationality with his common sense ; and by blending the two , these religions have been able to make their religious propositions more rational and more humane , and have thus played an increasingly important role in man 's this life and even become the source of cultures and moral principles of certain nations .  
To implement the Tenth Five-Year Plan , we must work hard to improve the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the entire population in the forward direction of an advanced culture , adhere to the idea of " tackling with both hands , both hands hard , " combine the rule of law with the rule of morality , and vigorously push ahead with the building of a socialist spiritual civilization . 
We must uphold the guideline of grasping things with both hands , with both hands firm , combine ruling the country according to law with ruling the country with ethics , follow the orientation for progress of advanced culture , and make efforts to enhance the ideological and moral standard and scientific and cultural qualities of the whole nation .  
can we crush the arrogance of criminal elements and boost the moral of the masses ; can we implement the various measures for comprehensive management of public security in real earnest ; and can we effectively ensure the healthy economic and social development .  
Overseas Chinese leaders expressed indignation at the hegemonic act of the U.S . spy plane 's collision with a Chinese military aircraft and the illegal invasion by the American plane of Chinese territorial air space and territory .  They reproached the United States one after another , saying that overseas Chinese and the Chinese people commonly consider this incident to wholly be the legal and moral responsibility of the United States , that the attitude of the United States is unreasonable , and its way of handling the situation inferior .  
However , we maintain that the United States should assume moral responsibility .  So the United States should be the first to take the next step , show as much goodwill as it possibly can , and make diplomatic mediation in a sustained manner .  If the United States confines itself , exerts verbal pressure , and even hints that trade sanctions may possibly be imposed and that several punitive measures may be applied with regard to the arms sales to Taiwan , no benefit will be brought to the current stalemate .  
At present , the mutual stirring of various cultural and ideological trends on a worldwide scale , the mingling of progressive and backward concepts , the increasing diversification of people 's orientations of value , moral concepts , and cultural choices and , in particular , the infiltration and offensives of the Western hostile forces against us , such as " Westernization " and " disintegration , " have made the contradiction and struggle in the ideological field more and more acute and complicated .  
Observers believe that the Chinese government carried out a reasonable , beneficial , and moral struggle in the process of handling this matter , and forced the downright hegemonic United States government to capitulate and admit that the American spy plane had encroached upon Chinese air space leading to the collision with a Chinese fighter plane and subsequent loss of its pilot .  The US government was compelled to make multiple expressions of regret , sadness , and apology , thereby strongly protecting China 's national dignity and the country 's sovereignty .

Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
The General Principles of the Education Law also explicitly require that " the state conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for those who receive education , and conduct ideal , moral , discipline , legal , national defense , and ethnic unity education . "  
They should stick to a lofty moral standard and the revolutionary spirit , keep the masses firmly in mind , struggle with painstaking efforts , align their personal interests with public interests , be concerned about and protect the interests of officers and soldiers and make great efforts to realize the Party 's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
and how to implement General Secretary Jiang 's principle of dunning the country by virtue , satisfactorily unify efforts to run the army according to law with efforts to step up ideological and moral education among officers and men and , while enhancing the legal system concept and moral quality of officers and men , enhance the management level of army units , raise the consciousness of officers and men in loving the army , learning military skills , and strictly observing discipline , and so on .  
Leaders and political institutions at all levels should , in accordance with the criteria , select promising soldiers with outstanding moral and military integrity and excellent and crucial soldiers , heroic models and exemplary figures in preparing for war , performing their duty and carrying out significant tasks , so as to allow this policy to be an award and a guide in further arousing enthusiasm in loving the military and learning military skills among the majority of soldiers .  
On several occasions , Comrade Jiang Zemin has also exhorted the whole party that party cadres , especially leading and senior cadres , should pass on their fine thinking , moral character , and personnel experiences in working hard for the party and people to their children and should strive to train the latter into people with a noble ethos and rich knowledge and that they should not take advantage of their positions and powers to seek illegitimate gain for their children .

During the past 30 years , detente and power politics have dominated the world arena . As a result , justice , truth and moral courage have been obscured , and adverse tides have continued to buffet the nation . With their unfounded prejudices , some unfriendly westerners have tried to distort the image of the Republic of China .  
What we are concerned about today is how , during the process of our society 's transformation and while our citizens pursue their economic lives , we can uphold our traditional ethical , spiritual , and moral concepts and fuse this into a harmonious and modern industrial society .  
The motive force behind progress is the pursuit of wealth . But even if people are well off , if they lack viable moral standards , then unrest and criminal behavior may arise . So we must set up a stable , ethical , harmonious society in which wealth is evenly distributed .  
In the first of the two pictures titled " Late to School , " we see a pupil standing in front of the blackboard as punishment , his twisted , piqued expression contrasting interestingly with the stiff , upright characters of the moral injunctions written on the board behind him .  
The result has been a change from unitary to pluralistic values , from closed ways of thinking to open ones , from moral and ethical considerations as a prime determinant of human relations to utilitarian and materialistic interests , from a simple and impoverished way of life to more prosperous and complex lifestyles .  
His words illustrate the type of thinking that lay behind the art of embroidery in ancient times . The use of celestial bodies and aspects of nature as designs for clothing reflects the harmony and fusion of man and nature . The flowery fowl is the brightly colored pheasant , the aquatic grasses express cleanliness , fire stands for illumination , and rice represents nourishment . Together the patterns are a symbol of the moral ideal of government , of concern over the destiny of mankind and compassion for the people .  
A : I only focus on how to do the job that I am doing at the current time . I have never considered the problem of future office . Because I personally believe that the Kuomintang has many talented people , the Kuomintang should select someone of accomplishment and moral fortitude to serve as the president 's main assistant .  
If textbooks can be diversified and a certain standard of quality maintained , so that people have more choice , then education will be more lively and multifarious , and that will be of greater assistance in a child 's mental and moral growth .  
This Chinese Hamlet is a story of emotional entanglements and moral dilemmas , because Chinese drama is strong on narrative , weak on emotional outpourings , and depends more on beautiful literary language than on philosophical content .  
For example , the Tun Hwa Radio fleet , the first to make use of radio communication , was established three years ago as a pilot project of the Institute of Transportation of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications . It upholds a policy of hiring only drivers of outstanding moral character and of employing not a single driver with a bad record so that passengers can feel at ease about riding a cab at any hour .  
Finally , let me speak of the moral character of roosters . The Han-shih wai-chuan ( Han Ying 's Illustrations of the Didactic Application of the Classic of Songs ) points to the five characteristics of the cock : " Wearing a hat like a scholar , it is scholarly ; with claws that pierce the flesh , it is martial ; attacking when confronted by an enemy , it is bold ; calling out when it finds food , it is benevolent ; standing guard at night without fail , it is trustworthy . "  
Many public officials are a step ahead of these laws , publicly declaring their assets before they go into effect . " Snails without a shell , " those too poor to afford to buy a house , have grabbed the opportunity to show their moral incorruptibility . But under-reporting was common . It seemed as if everyone was deeply afraid of being wealthy , worried that they would be deemed a " gold bull . "  
One has the feeling of getting a complete picture of Taiwan , and the magazine 's simple style makes for absorbing reading . In the past , people did not well understand conditions on the other side of the Taiwan Strait , and with Chinese people 's penchant for extreme views , if it was not seen as poor and backward , corrupt and decadent and with declining moral values , then it was seen as a place where everything was better , an earthly paradise where the streets are paved with gold .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
The Old Confucian is aroused and makes frequent passes at the girl . They dance and dance , but all of a sudden , the slender maiden turns into a black mist and then into a black serpent , scaring the old man away . Maybe the story has a profound moral : Do n't linger over the transitory beauty in front of your eyes , because it may very well be a serpent in disguise .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
Our two sons are five years apart in age , and went to the same Chinese school . Although the school also teaches Malay and English , Mandarin is the medium of instruction . Most importantly , being educated at the Chinese school taught my sons to understand our deep and ancient Chinese culture with its moral and ethical values . At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
Examples are Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi in the Han dynasty story The Peacocks Fly Southeast ; the Song dynasty patriotic poet Lu You and Tang Wan ; or Shen Sanbai and Yunniang in the Qing-dynasty Six Chapters of a Floating Life . The path of love for people in olden times was often rocky and strewn with pitfalls , and hedged about by an ossified social order and moral code . When the poet Lu You was 20 years old he married his cousin Tang Wan , his mother 's niece .  
People are often bedazzled by the earth-shaking " sacrifices " of romantic love , but Ko believes that classical love , which " succeeds " by day-to-day effort , morning and night , is even more special . This is the deep and subtle spirit of " joy without excess . " Perhaps this is why in the West there is the saying , " marriage is the tomb of love , " whereas the Chinese , in a society built on the Confucian moral code , feel that " marriage is the beginning of love . "  
Why should n't physical abilities also be tested ? " asks Chang Hsun-chen , principal at Yingchiao Junior High School , who believes that adding in a measure of physical fitness is a good way to attain the balanced , five-sided development ( moral , intellectual , physical , interpersonal , and artistic ) that is the stated goal of modern Chinese education .  
In addition , the author adopts a principle of " purposiveness " ( in which everything in life has some positive potential purpose ) , very akin to theology , to explain everything , and to persuade people of the wisdom of the definitive behavioral principles that can be expected to bring health and longevity . Individual initiative and moral responsibility are excluded completely .  
" The only purpose of financial operations is to turn a profit . There 's no such thing as moral or immoral , and no such thing as it being fair or unfair to hardworking individual countries or firms , " says Ding Kung-wha , highlighting the pragmatic and unsentimental nature of the financial world .  
With IVF , the surrogate mother need not have any direct physical contact with the prospective father . Yet although this might appear more in keeping with " human dignity " and " moral values , " it is precisely this artificial approach of " only wanting a child and not wanting sex , " which many people find suspect about the whole procedure .  
Huang feels that stories designed to make a moral point are oversimplified , and real life is much more complicated . What he likes is to capture human nature , as in the Chinese opera classic The Fourth Son Visiting His Mother , which retains its emotional impact today because the son is torn between family and country , wife and mother .  
This is true enough , but : " To have children learn from a negative example is not as simple as presenting exemplary figures and saying ' do as they did . ' It means spending more time and effort interpreting the stories for the children and discussing them with them , and in the current situation where moral education is only a subsidiary subject with inadequate teaching resources , this is no easy matter , " says Hsieh Li-hung with regret .  
Wu Wu-tien says that by presenting only positive role models , current moral education deliberately obscures the darker side of life and the reasons for it . The theoretical background to this is a belief that children are not mature enough to make proper judgements . To prevent the " bad " element in children 's natural character being awakened and tempted , some people sincerely believe that " if one does n't let children come into contact with bad people and bad things , they will not turn bad . "  
" For fear of children getting ill , one ca n't simply deny the existence of germs , " says Wu Wu-tien . In his view , only by " immunizing " children-presenting them with a realistic view with both positive and negative examples , and so training their capacity for moral discernment and judgement-can one give them a mental rock to hold fast to when faced with all kinds of temptations , so that they are not easily led astray .  
Such questions are ignored , as are the intangible emotional aspects of morality , such as self-esteem , self-respect , caring for others , and even a sense of shame , a sense of guilt , moral courage and so on . Thus morality can easily become superficial or even a complete sham , adopted for show but not practiced in reality . In other words , under these circumstances moral actions never advance beyond the stage of " heteronomous morality " [ imposed by outside authority ] , and are unlikely to come from the heart .  
Chien Chun-an notes that extramarital affairs entail enormous risks . A third party becomes involved in the family life of others , the people having the affair face a moral challenge , and after the most romantic initial stage passes , pressure grows to bring the affair to an end . Having chosen a path of love that is by nature misguided and tragic , it is natural that it leads to serious problems .  
The Taipei District Court ruled that although the topic of Ho Ya-wei 's report-about how Huang Chao-fu had spent NT $ 20 million in his first campaign as a KMT nominee for the legislature but received only 200 votes-could be described as " fair game . . . its sarcasm virtually dripped from the page . . . Because this affected the reputation of the plaintiff 's private moral character , the defendant was clearly acting maliciously . "  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
In great universities , all the various ideas co-exist : the philosophic schools of materialism and idealism , the aesthetic schools of realism and romanticism , the economic schools of mercantilism and laissez-faire , the ethical schools of moral purpose and utilitarianism , and the cosmological schools of optimism and negativism . That is why universities are ' universal , ' " declared Tsai .  
Laozi and Confucius both emerged late in the Spring and Autumn period , in a time of frequent warfare when the system of moral education through ritual and music of the Zhou dynasty ( 11th century-256 BC ) had collapsed , and the nobility had abandoned themselves to a life of wanton extravagance supported by ruthless exploitation of the common people .  
Extrapolating further , Ma says that overemphasis on knowledge and science means people lack the appropriate mental tools to help them understand their inner life . Thus , as material culture becomes more and more advanced and knowledge becomes more and more objective , we become more and more deficient in spiritual cultivation , and our moral character is more and more debased .  
And taiji means " the natural way " - standing erect and centered , being impartial and unbiased , neither lacking nor in excess , adhering to one position-in other words the way of the natural world , and the way of the human being . Or in short : moral cultivation , the very purpose of human life .  
Lee has been steeped all his life in traditional Chinese morality , and has always sought to inject his personal ideas into his movies , " teaching a moral lesson in a fun way , " as the old Chinese saying goes . Many commentators have criticized Lee for being preachy , doctrinaire , and relying too much on stage techniques in his movies . Some even accuse him of sensationalism . Lee answers with a disarming , " That 's me , alright !  
Ko 's own attitude towards the Song dynasty is a mixture of love and hate . Those deeply introspective literary types with their lofty moral standards produced artistic achievements of the highest order . Yet they also seemed " over-civilized , " devoid of any streak of wildness , as if lacking part of what makes us human .  
" Building on this foundation , we will continue striving to protect this resource . Human rights are dependent on more than merely political and legal struggle . Rather , they involve independent thinking and respect for people as individuals . We 've got to take our conception of human rights and make it an integral part of people 's basic moral fiber , so that it is fully manifested in everyday life . "  
The main characters seem to operate on a higher moral level than most people , because they alone consider it important to make a record of these neglected bronze and stone statues , to enable the public to understand their political and social significance .  
Luantan by day . . . For a long time , traditional Chinese moral concepts effectively banned females from performing in the often-suggestive three-part tea-picking opera , so the female roles used to be played in most cases by male performers . That did not change in any major way until the 1940s when a group of child stars-including Cheng Jung-hsing 's grandmother ( Cheng Mei-mei ) and Ah Yu-tan-broke the taboo .  
In Christian culture the mother is a sacred figure , symbolizing purity , charity , and tolerance . In traditional Chinese culture , by contrast , mothers not only were supposed to have certain moral virtues , but were also bearers of heavy burdens of pain and suffering . A mother was fated to cry endless tears and submit to countless indignities .  
Lin Pao-chun says , " Before Historical Records , Chinese military strategy had absorbed the idea of ruling with compassion , and the highest objective of the student of the martial arts was to eliminate the violence in his own heart . Lin expands on this point , stating that in the ethos of the knight-errant , magnanimity was more important than fighting skill . Moreover , knights-errant were expected to be ethical , moral , honorable , decorous and patriotic , as well as protecting the common folk .  
These ideas affected the ways in which writers chose to present knights-errant in their novels . Says Lin , " At the most fundamental level , knights-errant are supposed to embody moral virtue . So while a writer might allow his hero to be less than perfect in some small ways , he will always stand fast when faced with an issue or choice of consequence . "  
Courageously facing marriage As a sociologist well aware of the rising divorce rate and the unwillingness of young people to even get hitched because they have seen too many unhappy couples , Hsueh gives some practical advice . While people should make as serious a commitment to marriage as they do to a career , as in a career one can change course or start again . When a marriage really can not be xxxxsustained , divorce should be a socially acceptable alternative , and does not symbolize personal failure or moral bankruptcy .  
As a result of educational reform , children today are no longer ranked in strict order of their test marks . Instead , their attainment is reflected by broader grades-A , B , C and so on . Also , the principle of more equal emphasis on five major aspects of education is gradually being implemented . Today intellectual education accounts for only 60% of overall grades , while physical education accounts for 20% , and moral and social education each account for 10% .  
Will the evolution of food serve as a metaphor for the whole relationship ? Recently all the major political parties in Taiwan have been at war over the issue of public referenda , amidst dark hints from the United States and overt threats from the PRC . One can not help but sigh . When we were small , " recovering the mainland " was the unquestionable mission of the nation , and " pacifism " was a betrayal of the country and an evasion of moral responsibility .  
What he found even more tragic , he wrote , is that " I can feel that in the future there will be more and more wasted lives like this in Taiwan . Under the policies of the colonial regime , the poorer the Taiwanese become , the more lower class families will be disrupted , and the more children will grow up bereft of proper moral instruction . "  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
That is particularly true as those States do not have a shining record in internal or external protection of human rights and do not offer in their own social experience a suitable moral and material environment for the welfare of human beings .  
It strongly urged the international community to continue its moral and material assistance to South Africans in order to help create stable conditions for the rapid and peaceful attainment of a new democratic and nonracial South Africa .  
The investigation of human rights violations in the world and the moral sanctioning of regimes responsible for grave and systematic violations was a great achievement by the United Nations human rights system and should be maintained and improved .  
Requests once again the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system to continue to provide all humanitarian , material and moral assistance to Namibia and all newly independent and emerging States so as to enable them to consolidate their political independence and achieve genuine economic independence ;  
Conscious of the fact that the physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development of the child , the future generation , depends on a safe , secure and adequate place to live ,  
I ask the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether he is obliged to defend the moral principles in the United Nations Charter or whether he should console the dying and the bereaved by saying that there are others elsewhere who are suffering worse fates .  Is there not , in the context of the larger picture , a special role for the United Nations to provide international leadership ?  
The United Nations has the power to say no to those States and peoples who do not respect the religious , political , moral and artistic convictions of others ; no to those States and peoples who do not respect minorities , be they national or of any other kind , and their languages , which are an essential element of cultural transmission ; no , above all , when repression is accompanied by the use of force and by cruelty , torture and other unspeakable acts .  
It is precisely its global character which offers us its first and fundamental key and which confirms that there are indeed universal human rights rooted in the nature of the person , rights which reflect the objective and inviolable demands of a universal moral law .  
A decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity ; in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man 's historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit .  
But what would it have been like had the United Nations not existed to channel activities for peace , to oversee the post-war period and the cold war , to give its moral sanction to the emancipation of peoples , to coordinate assistance for economic and social development and to set a moral standard and order relations among nations and human beings ?  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
The generation that enters the year 2000 faced with a perceptible crisis of ethical and moral values must renew with more vigour than ever its commitment to society , guided always by its convictions and never by considerations of convenience , respecting human rights and struggling with all its force for the perennial principles of justice , freedom and equality for all .  
If the Security Council is to wield the political and moral authority needed for its decisions to be effectively implemented , its composition can not be perceived by the general membership as imbalanced either in geographic terms or in terms of participation by industrialized and developing countries .  
This integrated Central American initiative is one of national and regional development in the political , moral , economic , social and ecological fields , involving policies , programmes and actions in the short - , medium - and long-term .  
It is therefore essential that the international community defend the peace process , give it political , economic and moral support and encourage the parties concerned to work for a genuine peace based on mutual understanding , cooperation , security , dignity and respect for the legitimate rights of all .  
Special emphasis should also be given to the reform of education content and curricula , especially curricula that reinforce traditional female roles which deny women opportunities for full and equal partnership in society , at all levels , focusing on scientific literacy , moral values and learning of skills , adapted to the changing environment and to life in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies .

Broad parliamentary support would be required to change the legal situation , especially in view of strong opposition from the Catholic Church , whose moral authority had been enhanced by its defence of human rights under the military dictatorship .  
It was stated that , if established under the Charter , the Court would be supported by the Organization 's moral authority and its universality , and furthermore the unity of the international legal order in respect of criminal matters would be assured .  
It was not possible to set up or put into operation the national state security council because those who were to be members had declined and the rebels came up against the unanimous condemnation and firm demands on the part of the political , moral , social and even military forces calling for a return to constitutional legality . 
Furthermore , the requests of the above-mentioned States for equating their own status with that of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are not acceptable either from the political or the moral standpoint and could create a negative precedent for other States , leading to possible broader destabilization of the international community , in view of the fact that their independence was gained by forcible secession , prohibited by international law .  
This allegation is in radical conflict with the texts of the reports of the tripartite committee and its technical subcommittee , which make it absolutely clear that Iraq is completely serious about observing its legal , humanitarian and moral responsibilities in this field , and that the competent Iraqi authorities have dealt with many of the missing persons ' dossiers within the context of the circumstances and data relating to the matter .  
This continuing practice by the United States of America , which is unwarranted and contrary to its legal and moral obligations under the Headquarters Agreement , the Charter of the United Nations and international custom , points to a serious shortcoming that must be eliminated and corrected by all possible means . 
The system must therefore be reviewed and updated so that resolutions are of the highest technical quality , carry proper moral weight and have the proper deterrent effect , are carried out with the swiftness required in order to protect and compensate the victims and are respected and implemented promptly by the relevant bodies .  
However , the principle that harm which does not entail economic loss should be compensated is not a new absolute in law , as can be seen in the universal acceptance , in domestic and international law , of compensation for moral injury , which is as difficult to evaluate in monetary terms as ecological harm .  
Oman believes that there is an obligation a moral obligation , a political obligation on all members of the international community to work together united with one voice that would say No to ethnic cleansing , No to rape of Muslim women and No to the continued violations of the safe areas . 
The question must be raised : what possible moral authority do NATO and the United Nations have to pursue a relentless campaign of mass bombardment of the Republic of Srpska , causing unprecedented material damage and numerous civilian casualties ?  
In conformity with article 32 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , 10 / protect children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child 's education , or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development ;  
The promulgation by the United States of America of laws and regulations imposing an unjust embargo on the Cuban people constitutes a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations since it has the purpose of achieving unilateral political objectives that bear no relation to international peace and security .  This embargo is , moreover , incompatible with the most elementary humanitarian and moral standards .  
That situation is epitomized by the unjust comprehensive embargo that has been imposed on Iraq for almost five years , leaving an inhumane impact on various aspects of life and producing social conditions alien to our society , which adheres to high moral values and is distinct in its security and stability .

NULLAs emphasized in previous reports , one of the circumstances leading to abuses against women is the practically unlimited powers granted to members of the Popular Police Forces and the People 's Committees " in the preservation of the moral health of the society " .

In his country , whose population reflected an ethnic mixture created by successive waves of migrants , his Government had systematically extended moral , political and material support to all peoples struggling against racial discrimination and apartheid .  
To our hosts , the Government and people of China , no words can adequately express my gratitude for the physical infrastructure you placed at our disposal ; for the moral and friendly support you provided to make us feel we are at home here ; for the untiring efforts you made to secure and protect us ; and also for the many spectacular entertainments and events arranged for participants in both the NGO Forum and the Conference . Thank you .

Further discussion of the major issues involved would be required , with a view to the establishment of an effective international criminal court which enjoyed moral authority , independence and universal support .

This original approach by Benin to the reform of its civil service had three major advantages : first , the transfer of skills and the strengthening of national expertise ; secondly , the relatively low cost of the operation , compared with what it would have cost had it been conducted completely by international consultants ; thirdly , the integration of national cultural and moral values in the different proposals and recommendations , thus easing implementation of this reform policy by the citizens at large and by the users of public services in particular . 
The representative pointed out some of the social , political and economic consequences of the events in her country , including physical , psychological , moral and spiritual destabilization of the population , total destruction of the structures of the State and an economy which is now dominated by humanitarian assistance .

The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , I stressed , on behalf of the Government of San Marino , the need to reconsider the instrument of the embargo , its effectiveness and repercussions , especially in those cases where , in the absence of armed conflict , international isolation alone has proved a valid moral and political means of international pressure .  
Baali ( Algeria ) ( interpretation from French ) : Allow me , before making a few general comments on the report and role of the International Court of Justice , to perform the very pleasant duty of paying a well-deserved tribute to the President of the International Court of Justice , Mr . Mohammed Bedjaoui , a diplomat , jurist and statesman with exceptional professional , moral and human qualities , who has left a very clear stamp on the history of international relations over the last four decades .  
That conference will address the challenges related to the protection of children from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous , to interfere with the child 's education or to be harmful to the child 's health or physical , mental , spiritual , moral or social development .

Had the Special Rapporteur behaved in a neutral or objective manner , he would have called , without any hesitation and for purely humanitarian , legal and moral reasons , for the lifting of sanctions , at least in part on the grounds that human rights must be respected not only by individual countries but also by international organizations , particularly the Security Council .  
Ukraine afforded women equal rights and opportunities in the areas of education and specialized training , labour , remuneration , promotion and socio-political and cultural activities and also implemented special measures to protect the labour and health of women , enable women to combine work with motherhood , and extend legal protection and material and moral support to mothers and children .  
LAMAMRA ( Algeria ) said that an independent and effective international jurisdiction must be established which would enjoy unquestioned moral authority and whose actions would be guided solely by the rule of law , far removed from the political influences that could pervert it .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;
