Currently , foreign funded enterprises in Gansu Province no longer worry about investment risk .  To ensure that the opening up to the outside world can be implemented smoothly , during the " eighth five-year plan " period ( 1991 to 1995 ) , Gansu Province 's foreign affairs insurance industry developed rapidly , and it has already provided an accumulated sum of 61.1-billion yuan in terms of risk safeguard .  Insurance coverages include the four large categories of property , liability , credit and life , with more than sixty primary and secondary risk types .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
In the course of town construction , attention should be focused on the concentration of industries and population ; through the use of regional and industrial policies , economic levers , and administrative measures , we should guide and promote the concentration of secondary and tertiary industries in towns and accept the stimulating influence of major cities so that towns ' economic and population scales will increase rapidly .  
In line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " Beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .  We should resolutely implement the spirit of the official , written reply of the State Council ;  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
The motions put forth by the democratic parties and some members on narrowing the gap between schools at the compulsory education stage ; practically lightening the homework burden of primary and secondary school students ; and so on reflected the problems that had caused strong public resentment and that the education departments at all levels had to tackle without delay .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .  
According to the " 2000 report on China 's national economic and social development " published recently by the State Planning Commission , in 1999 , the total employment of China 's primary industry reduced by 1.96-million and that of the secondary industry increased by only 2.54-million , while the tertiary industry not only absorbed the great majority of the year 's new labor force but also accepted some of the labor force transferred from primary and secondary industry . 
As a result of economic and trade cooperation with the mainland , the proportions of primary and secondary industries in the island 's total output value have kept declining , while that of tertiary industry has gradually risen , thereby effectively promoting Taiwan 's economic transformation and industrial structural adjustment .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
When promoting the optimized upgrading of the national economic structure , although we must not neglect changes in the industrial structure , or the significance of raising the relative proportion of the tertiary industry on the basis of optimized internal structures in the primary and secondary industries , at the same time we must not neglect to promote structural optimization and upgrades in the other areas .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
State-owned enterprises in cities must transfer all primary and secondary schools , hospitals , and other social service organizations to unified planning and management by local governments .  For some time , funding needed for this purpose will be jointly shared by both the enterprise and the government before it is gradually transferred in its entirety to the government .  Some of the organizations can be transformed into commercial operations .  
" Primary Industry " Will Fall While " Tertiary Industry " Will RiseThe Outline proposes that the principal anticipated targets for China 's economic structural adjustment be as follows : By 2005 , the proportions of added value of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries held in the GDP will be 13 percent , 51 percent , and 36 percent respectively , and the proportions of employees in these industries held in the total employees of entire society will be 44 percent , 23 percent , and 33 percent respectively . 
Among the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries , the two ends are small while the middle is bulging - - the tertiary industry makes up only about 21 percent of the township enterprises , significantly below the national average of 30 percent and the international average of 60 percent .  
At the same time , the Japanese Government headed by Yoshiro Mori also adopted an indulgent attitude towards a history textbook for secondary schools compiled by a right-wing organization .  As the textbook sought to beautify the Japanese war of aggression , the incident triggered wave upon wave of vehement criticisms at home and abroad .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , our priorities of priorities in the field of education will be to make nine-year compulsory education universal and to eliminate illiteracy among young people .  Besides increasing the percentage of the population covered by nine-year compulsory education , we must also make senior secondary education more widespread .  Preschool also must be further developed .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
Unify the standards for textbook writing .  Rural primary and secondary schools should adopt economical and suitable editions .  Governments of provinces ( autonomous regions , municipalities directly administered by the central government ) should procure and distribute textbooks using the bidding method and have textbooks delivered to students on time at the least costs while ensuring quality .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
It is secondary whether the Sino-US " constructive strategic cooperative partnership " can be maintained .  However , it is very dangerous and unwise for the new US government to regard China as its imaginary enemy , to shift its strategic focus to Asia , even to attempt to team up with Russia to punish China , and to regard and use the issue of China 's eventual reunification as a card to obstruct China . Almost all the experts well-versed with China issues disagree with Bush Jr . '  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
Nearly 20-million rural cadres and grass-roots cadres in China have mastered one practical technology or two , and among them , 3-million people won primary professional technical titles and 500,000 people won secondary professional technical titles . 
Positive steps should be taken to centralize and hand over the power of managing teachers ' wages to the county authorities in conjunction with measures adopted by the departments concerned to carefully verify the authorized number and total payroll of rural primary and secondary school teachers .  " Special wage fund accounts " should be set up in all counties in accordance with regulations to ensure that rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid fully and on time .  The supervision and management of outlays for teachers ' pay should also be strengthened .  
In particular , irregular school fees for primary and secondary school pupils , irregular fees for rebuilding power grids and power supply facilities , irregular fees for housing construction , coercive subscription of newspapers and journals , and fees collected for unrealistic upgrading activities must be stopped .  The local authorities must not be allowed to raise funds in violation of the established policies for various purposes and under various excuses .  This year , some areas were seriously afflicted by natural disasters , and the masses there encountered difficulties in their production and daily livelihood .  
The court held that Liu Yunfang , Wang Jindong , Xue Hongjun and Liu Xiuqin had organized , planned , instigated and helped " Falungong " practitioners to carry out self-immolation and their acts constituted the crimes of international murder which should be seriously punished according to the law .  Liu Xiuqin only played a secondary role in the collaborated criminal act .  She was an accessory .  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
When the new measure is implemented , investors , out of the hope of enjoying the huge price difference between the primary and secondary markets , will actively buy existing stocks before a new stock issue to increase their holdings , thereby increasing their rate of winning the stock allotment lot .  
He considers Tibet 's present industrial structure as irrational .  With the primary industry carrying too much weight , the secondary industry carrying too little weight , and the tertiary industry being undeveloped , it has the typical characteristics of an agricultural economy .  
With the transition to a market economy , the basic completion of small privatization , and the emergence and development of market-based service entities , Russia 's tertiary industries have developed rapidly , accounting for a growing share of the gross domestic product , while the shares of the primary and secondary industries have declined .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .

Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
On the other hand , nine-year compulsory education should be promoted in a comprehensive manner .  Reform of the curriculum should be deepened and efforts should be made to set up extracurricular activity bases and science museums to cultivate the scientific knowledge and innovative awareness of secondary and primary students , and promote quality education .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
A policy of " relaxed admission and strict graduation " should be applied in such disciplines as agriculture , forestry and animal husbandry of secondary vocational schools ; junior middle-school graduates with diplomas may be admitted to these disciplines without age limit and without having to pass an entrance examination ; and after they complete their studies and pass an examination , they will be issued a secondary vocational school diploma .  
Xu Kuangdi said that Shanghai had achieved sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy in recent years , having scored double-digit growth for eight consecutive years and further consolidated the pattern of relying on the secondary and tertiary industries to promote economic development .  
As of the end of June this year , the combined total of assets held by Chinese insurance companies had exceeded 310 billion yuan .  This is a rather hefty amount .  If a certain percentage of this amount is put on the secondary market , it is bound to become a main force and stabilizer for China 's securities market .  
The industrial structure in central and western regions has also shown a tendency toward optimization , with the quality of economic operations significantly enhanced .  In the first four years under the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the relative size of the secondary industry in central and western regions steadily expanded ;  
Shanghai 's decision-makers began to open the gate to liberalize their thinking and lost no time in coming up with a new industrial strategy to " give priority to developing the tertiary industry , readjust and transform the secondary industry , and steadily upgrade the primary industry . "  It boldly changed the several-decade-old " 2-3-1 " industrial development order to the " 3-2-1 " order .  
This " give-and-take " strategic readjustment became the mainline of the " Eighth Five-year Plan , " and during the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , this was combined with the overall readjustment of the setup of the municipality 's productive forces to promote the continuous " upgrading " of the standard and the quality of the secondary and tertiary industries .  
The secondary industry which is heavily based on high-tech and advanced sciences provides the real strength behind the tertiary industry 's development , and in turn the tertiary industry 's development provides the vast space and the technological and information services that allow the secondary industry to gear its operating funds to the market , and it also absorbs millions of the secondary industry 's surplus labor force , producing the effect of the secondary and tertiary industries promoting each other 's development .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .  These stipulations include : outstanding enlisted personnel and graduates of ordinary secondary specialized schools can be promoted to officers only after they have studied in and graduated from a military academy ;  
However , taking into consideration the negative impact of the expansionary financial policy , there is a need to adjust the focus of the macropolicy in a timely manner and correspondingly weaken the " primary " impetus , to prevent the excessive accumulation of negative effects resulting from the prolonged implementation of the policy on expansionary demand and fully invigorate the vitality of supply and civilian-run enterprises by strengthening the " secondary " impetus , thereby laying a solid foundation for the long-term , sustained stability of the national economy .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
Sixth , the difficulties faced by private enterprises in the aspect of financing are being gradually resolved ; and both the number and the proportion of private enterprises listed in the stock market will be increased , and these listed companies are expected to form the mainstay of the secondary market .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
The respective proportion of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries was readjusted from 29 : 40.7 : 30.3 in 1995 to 23.3 : 42.7 : 34 in 2000 .  A new economic setup was taking shape under which the public ownership acted as the mainstay , diversified economic elements coexist , and non-public-owned economies were developing rapidly .  
Taking into account the general law governing the evolution of the industrial structures at home and abroad and the present conditions of the industrial development in Heilongjiang , our overall industrial structural orientation during the 10th Five-Year Plan period should be set on solidifying and improving the primary industry , optimizing and elevating the secondary industry , and accelerating the development of the tertiary industry .  
Second , the industrial structure will be adjusted , the process of industrialization will be quickened , the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in gross internal product will be raised to a level closer to the national average .  
In considering the selection of the decontamination methods , the consultants have taken into account the type , extent and spread of the contamination , prevailing work safety requirements , international standards on the level of soil contamination ; and the geographical setting of the contaminated areas and any possible secondary environmental impact on the neighbourhood .  
( c ) Apart from offering nine years ' free and universal basic education to all children between the ages of 6 and 15 , the Government has been raising the education level of the public through various measures .  For example , the Adult Education Section of the Education Department provides adult education at primary and secondary levels and English courses for interested persons aged 15 or above .  It also subvents non-government organisations in providing adult education courses , including literacy class .  
Seminars and experience-sharing sessions on environmental protection issues are jointly organised by the Education Department , other government departments and green groups on a regular basis for primary and secondary schools .  The main contents of these sessions include waste disposal .  
Major existing uses include a sports ground , an indoor recreational centre , a swimming pool , a special school , a health centre , a divisional police station , a fire and ambulance station , a Regional Services Department vehicle depot , as well as primary and secondary schools .  
As for the implementation of TOC in secondary schools , the Curriculum Development Council ( CDC ) has endorsed the incorporation of the conceptual framework of TOC into the future revision or updating of subject syllabi .  From 2001 , Subject Committees of Chinese , English and Mathematics will at their discretion incorporate TOC elements conducive to effective teaching and learning .  However , there is no plan to use TOA to replace the Junior Secondary Education Assessment ( JSEA ) or the public examinations at school certificate level , the spokesman stressed .  
( a ) whether , apart from giving hearing tests to all Primary One students at present , it provides such tests for primary and secondary school students in the regular medical examination conducted every year ; if it does , what the sense of hearing of students in Hong Kong is , as indicated in the results of those hearing tests in the past three years ; if not , the reasons for not providing such tests and whether they are related to administrative , technical and financial difficulties ; and  
The planned GIC uses include a swimming pool complex , a sports stadium , a training school and other facilities of the Immigration Department , water-related recreational facilities / holiday camps , social welfare uses , a wholesale marine fish market , indoor recreational centres , and primary and secondary schools .  
To progressively promote school-based management for the next triennium , the Government will provide each public sector school with an anuual supplementary grant to cope with the additioanl administrative work arising from school-based management ( on average , $ 120,000 per primary school and $ 155,000 per secondary school ) .  The full year additional recurrent expenditure incurred will be $ 165 million .  
A total of 38 new secondary schools will also be built in the four school years from 1999-2000 at a capital cost of $ 3.89 billion to meet the demand for additional school places .  The full year additional recurrent expenditure is $ 1.38 billion .  
The opening up of the Committee aimed at enhancing the transparency and credibility of the existing school allocation system by involving the participation of non-officials in the decision-making process , he said .  At present , an applicant body interested in operating an estate kindergarten , aided primary or secondary school becomes eligible for consideration for the allocation of school premises when it is : * a charitable institution or trust of a public character exempted from tax under Section 88 of the Inland Revenue Ordinance ; and

" As all applications are of a high quality , the selection panel , comprising members from heads and teachers of primary , secondary and special schools , an academic from a tertiary institution and ED officers had a difficult task in coming up with the allocation decisions , " he said .  
A number of public education and publicity programmes were also considered at the meeting in several key areas specifically identified by SCOLAR . They include , inter alia , efforts to promote the standard of English in the workplace , the teaching of Putonghua in primary and secondary schools , and enhanced teacher training for Chinese / English language subject teachers .

However , for those secondary school students who live in the Islands District , which covers an extensive area , the time required for travelling to some secondary schools within their school net but distant from their places of residence is often longer than that required for travelling to schools in an adjacent school net .  For example , it takes more time for students living in Tung Chung of Lantau Island to go to secondary schools on Ping Chau and Cheung Chau than to those in Tsing Yi , Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan .  
The competition will be divided into 16 sections and 92 classes , including scented pot-plant , orchids , Chinese cymbidium , potted plant , cacti and succulent , foliage plant , African violet , bonsai type plant , floral arrangement in the western and oriental manner , floral art by school children , school garden plot , primary and secondary school potted plant growing / nursing etc .

Regarding the proposals of the Education Commission to allocate 85 per cent of Primary One places on the principle of " vicinity " and to encourage primary and secondary schools to link among themselves to facilitate direct admission of Primary Six students to the linked secondary schools , there are comments that such proposals will result in more parents giving false residential addresses or moving to districts which fall within the school nets of their preferred schools so as to enhance the chance of their children being admitted to those schools .  
With nine years of free and universal education , every primary student is guaranteed a junior secondary school place .  Strictly speaking , there is no need for a high-stake selective public examination for the purpose of secondary school place allocation .  
" The Project Springboard has been designed to provide another avenue for those who could not get a satisfactory result at the HKCEE or adult learners to pursue continuing education .  Its serves to provide a newly developed articulation ladder for continuing education , apart from the traditional secondary education " he said .

I have received a complaint in which a veteran Senior Graduate Master ( SGM ) who has changed his job from a Direct Subsidy Scheme secondary school to take up a Graduate Master ( " GM " ) post in an aided secondary school is paid a salary equivalent to the starting pay of a newly-inducted GM plus incremental credit for his recognized experience .  
Non-profit-making PISs are eligible for land grants at nominal premium and capital grants ( up to 100% of the cost of building a standard design primary or secondary public sector school of the same student population ) for the construction of school premises .  
" The advantages of a ' through-train ' school are that it ensures the continuity of the primary and secondary curriculum , strengthens the school 's understanding of and attention for its students , alleviates students ' adaptation problems upon their promotion to the secondary school and facilitates the arrangements for ' enhancement and remedial measures ' as well as ' cross level subject setting ' , " Mr Tai emphasised .  
" With respect to collaboration between linked primary and secondary schools , the ED recommends that at the initial stage of development , the primary and secondary schools forming ' through-trains ' should still be considered as separate entities in fund allocation and financial arrangements , staff establishment , and school management . "  " They will not be treated as a new type of schools .  
Our tertiary , secondary and primary education will become better and better , and the trend for lifelong learning will become even stronger through Government encouragement and the active support and participation of the people .  All these efforts in the education sector will no doubt enable us to meet the needs of our social and economic development in the 21st Century .  
That is why in our education reforms , while continuing to make primary and secondary education even more widely available , while committing to improve the quality of our entire public school system , we have also put in place the important initiative to enhance the competitiveness of direct subsidy scheme schools , and to help more private schools to meet the diverse quality needs of different parents and students .

First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

Before 1973 the primary and secondary students began classes at the same time . Now that the parents have been through grades 1-12 under the same roof , the elementary and junior / senior high schoolers have separate daily flag ceremonies , with the national anthem resounding four times .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Major infrastructure projects cost a lot of money and are not easy to bring on line , but when all is said and done these ravenous monsters will steadily leave the stage , or will become of only secondary importance , and leave most of the budgetary pie to others . What really seems " an unending drain that can never be controlled " is that part of the budget which elicits the most extreme emotions both for and against , social welfare .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
Quite the opposite from what outsiders suspected , the principal reason for prolonging talks was in fact claims of " unfair commercial advantages . " The seemingly sensitive questions of sovereignty and political rivalry were actually secondary .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !

As for how serious the situation should become before closing schools , Chen Chien-jen , a professor at the Graduate Institute of Epidemiology at NTU 's School of Public Health , pointed out that judgment about the seriousness of an outbreak requires an objective decision based on an understanding of the communicability of a disease , the number and density of people who are infected , and the rate of secondary infection , as well as other epidemiological data , and should not be based on a subjective considerations .  
In truth , the primary and secondary mathematics curricula that everyone is familiar with , both in the West and here in Asia , has the same roots : the Industrial Revolution . Just like the modern curricula for languages , sciences , history , geography , art and physical education , the math curriculum has been designed to teach small numbers of the elite . Even in the 1960s , after the advent of universal education , the purpose of math education was to train scientists .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
They could take the kneaded clay , wrap it on the outside of the shards , and tap it down lightly with a wooden stick to make the clay more compact and solid . The stick would have patterns carved into it which would then be left imprinted on the clay . But this decorative effect , thinks Cheng , was probably secondary to the functional purpose of compacting the clay .  
" Let me take you soaring over a stretch of green fields / Piercing a tunnel of greenery bathed in the setting sun / Let the cool breeze and the fragrance of oranges run through your fingers / Cast off your worries and let your mind go free . The great peak beckons to me with a gesture / The secondary peak nods in my direction / The mountain coffee sends your troubles packing / The winding highland roads call : Hurry up and get started ! "

Would n't they fail to reach their warm breeding grounds to propagate their young ? In Sweden , where environmental education is well developed , outdoor education in elementary and secondary schools goes something like this : Students select a lakeside for long-term observation of changes to its plants , insects , water and shoreline , and try to find the causes for environmental ills . Some schools go to nearby islands for fieldwork , and teachers lead students to sit on the cliffs , experience the ocean and write poetry to express their feelings .

Other elements relate mostly to building and enhancing capacities such as universal primary education , wide access to secondary , vocational and higher education , with emphasis on science and technology , entrepreneurship development , particularly for small and medium-scale enterprises , and building a competent civil service , including the provision of adequate incentives .  
In effect , the creation of secondary markets in mortgages is a subject to which increasing attention is being paid in the housing finance sector in the Latin American countries , where strong legislative , institutional and enabling initiatives are being taken towards that end.Indeed , various Latin American countries have been implementing or enhancing this mechanism .  
The Government should also conduct a comprehensive review of all educational curricula at the primary and secondary levels with a view to eliminating remaining discriminatory aspects , to remedy the stereotypical portrayal of women and girls and to create an educational environment that is conducive to girls and womens education and learning .  
In the past , the social sector was neglected and perceived as being secondary , parasitic and dependent on other sectors rather than being the source of productivity and strategic input to the economic sector .  
To introduce free secondary education and offer financial assistance in case of need , indicating the children concerned , including by gender , age , region , rural / urban area , and national , social and ethnic origin , and the budget allocated for that purpose ;  
In contrast , the view was expressed that the distinction between primary and secondary rules was intellectually tempting , but rather artificial , hard to maintain , difficult to apply in practice and sometimes invalid .  
In Kabul , considered by the Taliban to be in direst need of moral reform , the authorities kept a close watch on the officially sanctioned primary and secondary education for girls in mosque schools , and obstructed informal home tutoring .  
The Committee is further concerned at the limited access of children with disabilities to formal or vocational educational opportunities and at the proportionally low number of girls attending primary or secondary school .  
In 2000 , nonstop operation of the secondary global positioning system ( GPS ) station ( International GPS Service ) was maintained , with continuous meteorological observations by a digital meteorological station ( temperature , pressure and humidity ) .  
Weak human resources , as measured by a composite index ( Augmented Physical Quality of Life Index ) based on indicators of life expectancy at birth , per capita daily calorie intake , combined primary and secondary school enrolment , and adult literacy ;  
In his previous report , the Special Representative had drawn attention to the considerable discrimination faced by women in Equatorial Guinea , as reflected in the fact that the gross national product produced by women is less than half that produced by men ; the illiteracy rate among women is three times greater than among men ; and the number of women reaching secondary school level is half that of men , among other factors .  
The Committee welcomes the State partys efforts in the field of education , in particular the inclusion of human rights teaching , including childrens rights , in the school curricula , but it remains concerned about the high drop-out and repetition rates in primary and secondary schools , disparities between urban and rural areas in terms of access to education and to quality education , the insufficient number of well-trained teaching staff and childrens limited access to materials and text books .  
Since 1993 , however , secondary-level institutions have been undergoing extensive restructuring through the Reform of Secondary Education ( ROSE ) project which is aimed at improving the quality and equity of educational provisions at the secondary level through the establishment of a common national curriculum for grades 7 to 9 .  
Educational modules on international migration and development have been produced and included in social studies courses in elementary and secondary schools ; educational specialists have been trained in the application of the modules in public schools .  
It also welcomed the decision of the special session to intensify political commitment to close the gender gap in primary and secondary education by 2005 and to ensure free , compulsory and universal primary education for both boys and girls by 2015 .  
To this end , we have been including the subject of civic education in primary and secondary school curricula , and we have been developing large-scale civic campaigns to provide education at the national level about democratic values .  
Currently , foreign funded enterprises in Gansu Province no longer worry about investment risk .  To ensure that the opening up to the outside world can be implemented smoothly , during the " eighth five-year plan " period ( 1991 to 1995 ) , Gansu Province 's foreign affairs insurance industry developed rapidly , and it has already provided an accumulated sum of 61.1-billion yuan in terms of risk safeguard .  Insurance coverages include the four large categories of property , liability , credit and life , with more than sixty primary and secondary risk types .  
the industrial structure is irrational , the total number of secondary and tertiary industries is not large enough , with low technological content and poor efficiency .  
In the course of town construction , attention should be focused on the concentration of industries and population ; through the use of regional and industrial policies , economic levers , and administrative measures , we should guide and promote the concentration of secondary and tertiary industries in towns and accept the stimulating influence of major cities so that towns ' economic and population scales will increase rapidly .  
In line with the principle of " strengthening the primary industry , readjusting the secondary industry , and developing the tertiary industry , " Beijing should rely on scientific and technological progress and innovations to strategically readjust its economic structure .  We should resolutely implement the spirit of the official , written reply of the State Council ;  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
The motions put forth by the democratic parties and some members on narrowing the gap between schools at the compulsory education stage ; practically lightening the homework burden of primary and secondary school students ; and so on reflected the problems that had caused strong public resentment and that the education departments at all levels had to tackle without delay .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .  
According to the " 2000 report on China 's national economic and social development " published recently by the State Planning Commission , in 1999 , the total employment of China 's primary industry reduced by 1.96-million and that of the secondary industry increased by only 2.54-million , while the tertiary industry not only absorbed the great majority of the year 's new labor force but also accepted some of the labor force transferred from primary and secondary industry . 
As a result of economic and trade cooperation with the mainland , the proportions of primary and secondary industries in the island 's total output value have kept declining , while that of tertiary industry has gradually risen , thereby effectively promoting Taiwan 's economic transformation and industrial structural adjustment .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
When promoting the optimized upgrading of the national economic structure , although we must not neglect changes in the industrial structure , or the significance of raising the relative proportion of the tertiary industry on the basis of optimized internal structures in the primary and secondary industries , at the same time we must not neglect to promote structural optimization and upgrades in the other areas .  
To this end , those engaged in ideological and political work must study and apply Marxism 's materialist dialectics .  They must use the " Three Represents " and other theoretical innovations of our Party . They must penetrate phenomena and see their basic nature , differentiate primary from secondary , and grasp the overall situation .  They must not make a tempest in a teapot because problems appear , nor must they allow matters to go unchecked .  They must analyze objectively , and actively seek countermeasures .  
State-owned enterprises in cities must transfer all primary and secondary schools , hospitals , and other social service organizations to unified planning and management by local governments .  For some time , funding needed for this purpose will be jointly shared by both the enterprise and the government before it is gradually transferred in its entirety to the government .  Some of the organizations can be transformed into commercial operations .  
" Primary Industry " Will Fall While " Tertiary Industry " Will RiseThe Outline proposes that the principal anticipated targets for China 's economic structural adjustment be as follows : By 2005 , the proportions of added value of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries held in the GDP will be 13 percent , 51 percent , and 36 percent respectively , and the proportions of employees in these industries held in the total employees of entire society will be 44 percent , 23 percent , and 33 percent respectively . 
Among the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries , the two ends are small while the middle is bulging - - the tertiary industry makes up only about 21 percent of the township enterprises , significantly below the national average of 30 percent and the international average of 60 percent .  
At the same time , the Japanese Government headed by Yoshiro Mori also adopted an indulgent attitude towards a history textbook for secondary schools compiled by a right-wing organization .  As the textbook sought to beautify the Japanese war of aggression , the incident triggered wave upon wave of vehement criticisms at home and abroad .  
During the Tenth Five-Year Plan , our priorities of priorities in the field of education will be to make nine-year compulsory education universal and to eliminate illiteracy among young people .  Besides increasing the percentage of the population covered by nine-year compulsory education , we must also make senior secondary education more widespread .  Preschool also must be further developed .  
Fourth , increase support for compulsory education in poor areas in central and west China to promote its development .  Fifth , make sure that the wages of rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid on time .  
Unify the standards for textbook writing .  Rural primary and secondary schools should adopt economical and suitable editions .  Governments of provinces ( autonomous regions , municipalities directly administered by the central government ) should procure and distribute textbooks using the bidding method and have textbooks delivered to students on time at the least costs while ensuring quality .  
If some peasants attain a higher level of scientific and technological knowledge and expertise , get access to more information , master more sophisticated work skills , and know how to run machines for processing farm products , then they will be able to break new ground in the countryside to develop the secondary and tertiary industries , and thus promote the adjustment of the rural production structure .  
Implementing a system according to which division , brigade and regimental level commanders in the infantry , naval , air and secondary artillery forces receive training at military academies and universities from other branches of the military is an important measure in improving the knowledge of our military cadres , in cultivating commanders of united military operations , and in improving our military 's ability to conduct joint operations .  
It is secondary whether the Sino-US " constructive strategic cooperative partnership " can be maintained .  However , it is very dangerous and unwise for the new US government to regard China as its imaginary enemy , to shift its strategic focus to Asia , even to attempt to team up with Russia to punish China , and to regard and use the issue of China 's eventual reunification as a card to obstruct China . Almost all the experts well-versed with China issues disagree with Bush Jr . '  
It is particularly necessary to enhance moral education , and conduct patriotic , collectivist , and socialist education for secondary and elementary school students , conduct education in the fine tradition of the Chinese nation , revolutionary tradition , and national defense , and enhance ideological and moral education .  
Nearly 20-million rural cadres and grass-roots cadres in China have mastered one practical technology or two , and among them , 3-million people won primary professional technical titles and 500,000 people won secondary professional technical titles . 
Positive steps should be taken to centralize and hand over the power of managing teachers ' wages to the county authorities in conjunction with measures adopted by the departments concerned to carefully verify the authorized number and total payroll of rural primary and secondary school teachers .  " Special wage fund accounts " should be set up in all counties in accordance with regulations to ensure that rural primary and secondary school teachers are paid fully and on time .  The supervision and management of outlays for teachers ' pay should also be strengthened .  
In particular , irregular school fees for primary and secondary school pupils , irregular fees for rebuilding power grids and power supply facilities , irregular fees for housing construction , coercive subscription of newspapers and journals , and fees collected for unrealistic upgrading activities must be stopped .  The local authorities must not be allowed to raise funds in violation of the established policies for various purposes and under various excuses .  This year , some areas were seriously afflicted by natural disasters , and the masses there encountered difficulties in their production and daily livelihood .  
The court held that Liu Yunfang , Wang Jindong , Xue Hongjun and Liu Xiuqin had organized , planned , instigated and helped " Falungong " practitioners to carry out self-immolation and their acts constituted the crimes of international murder which should be seriously punished according to the law .  Liu Xiuqin only played a secondary role in the collaborated criminal act .  She was an accessory .  
Major changes have already taken place , and are currently taking place , in China 's economic system and in its composition of social classes .  In rural areas , along with the deepening of economic restructuring and the progress of agricultural industrialization , peasants have been organically integrated with the market ; and some of peasants have been separated from land and have engaged themselves in the secondary and tertiary industries , among whom some have joined township and town enterprises , some have become self-employed businessmen , while others have become entrepreneurs of private enterprises .  
When the new measure is implemented , investors , out of the hope of enjoying the huge price difference between the primary and secondary markets , will actively buy existing stocks before a new stock issue to increase their holdings , thereby increasing their rate of winning the stock allotment lot .  
He considers Tibet 's present industrial structure as irrational .  With the primary industry carrying too much weight , the secondary industry carrying too little weight , and the tertiary industry being undeveloped , it has the typical characteristics of an agricultural economy .  
With the transition to a market economy , the basic completion of small privatization , and the emergence and development of market-based service entities , Russia 's tertiary industries have developed rapidly , accounting for a growing share of the gross domestic product , while the shares of the primary and secondary industries have declined .  
We will take the adjustment of industrial structure as the main direction of attack in the strategic adjustment of economic structure , and the internal and external market demands as the orientation for reinforcing primary industry , elevating secondary industry , and developing tertiary industry on the strength of scientific and technological advancement and technological innovation .

Second , in the past 20 years , a major factor leading to an increase in China 's total-factor productivity is a large-scale allocation of key production factors resulted from structural changes .  What are particularly important are the transfer of rural labor forces and other resources to township and town enterprises and to the secondary and tertiary industries in cities , as well as a rapid development in non-state-owned economies .  
On the other hand , nine-year compulsory education should be promoted in a comprehensive manner .  Reform of the curriculum should be deepened and efforts should be made to set up extracurricular activity bases and science museums to cultivate the scientific knowledge and innovative awareness of secondary and primary students , and promote quality education .  
Second , we can increase the peasants ' nonagricultural income and also effectively increase agricultural labor productivity by reducing the number of laborers directly engaged in agriculture , switching more rural laborers to secondary and tertiary industries , and also guiding the rational movement of rural laborers to meet the objective needs of the towns and the developed areas .  
A policy of " relaxed admission and strict graduation " should be applied in such disciplines as agriculture , forestry and animal husbandry of secondary vocational schools ; junior middle-school graduates with diplomas may be admitted to these disciplines without age limit and without having to pass an entrance examination ; and after they complete their studies and pass an examination , they will be issued a secondary vocational school diploma .  
Xu Kuangdi said that Shanghai had achieved sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy in recent years , having scored double-digit growth for eight consecutive years and further consolidated the pattern of relying on the secondary and tertiary industries to promote economic development .  
As of the end of June this year , the combined total of assets held by Chinese insurance companies had exceeded 310 billion yuan .  This is a rather hefty amount .  If a certain percentage of this amount is put on the secondary market , it is bound to become a main force and stabilizer for China 's securities market .  
The industrial structure in central and western regions has also shown a tendency toward optimization , with the quality of economic operations significantly enhanced .  In the first four years under the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the relative size of the secondary industry in central and western regions steadily expanded ;  
Shanghai 's decision-makers began to open the gate to liberalize their thinking and lost no time in coming up with a new industrial strategy to " give priority to developing the tertiary industry , readjust and transform the secondary industry , and steadily upgrade the primary industry . "  It boldly changed the several-decade-old " 2-3-1 " industrial development order to the " 3-2-1 " order .  
This " give-and-take " strategic readjustment became the mainline of the " Eighth Five-year Plan , " and during the " Ninth Five-year Plan " period , this was combined with the overall readjustment of the setup of the municipality 's productive forces to promote the continuous " upgrading " of the standard and the quality of the secondary and tertiary industries .  
The secondary industry which is heavily based on high-tech and advanced sciences provides the real strength behind the tertiary industry 's development , and in turn the tertiary industry 's development provides the vast space and the technological and information services that allow the secondary industry to gear its operating funds to the market , and it also absorbs millions of the secondary industry 's surplus labor force , producing the effect of the secondary and tertiary industries promoting each other 's development .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .  These stipulations include : outstanding enlisted personnel and graduates of ordinary secondary specialized schools can be promoted to officers only after they have studied in and graduated from a military academy ;  
However , taking into consideration the negative impact of the expansionary financial policy , there is a need to adjust the focus of the macropolicy in a timely manner and correspondingly weaken the " primary " impetus , to prevent the excessive accumulation of negative effects resulting from the prolonged implementation of the policy on expansionary demand and fully invigorate the vitality of supply and civilian-run enterprises by strengthening the " secondary " impetus , thereby laying a solid foundation for the long-term , sustained stability of the national economy .  
China 's existing economic structure is riddled with problems .  Primarily , the industrial structure ( the primary , secondary , tertiary , and within various industries ) is poor ; regional ( primarily the eastern , central , and western regions ) developments are not coordinated , and the standard of urbanization is low .  
Sixth , the difficulties faced by private enterprises in the aspect of financing are being gradually resolved ; and both the number and the proportion of private enterprises listed in the stock market will be increased , and these listed companies are expected to form the mainstay of the secondary market .  
" Not only will it ease the pressure originating from the surplus of rural labor force , help raise the peasants ' income , divert a large number of redundant laborers to the secondary and tertiary industries , and strongly expedite agricultural restructuring , but also it will check haphazard influx of rural population into large cities , promote economic development , and forward urbanization . "  
it is essential to greatly increase key regional cities 's collecting functions and to strengthen their exemplary and stimulating role ; at the same time , we should vigorously develop small cities and towns ; we should promote the coordinated development of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries and the transfer of the surplus agricultural labor force through a rational distribution of cities and towns .  
The respective proportion of the primary , secondary , and tertiary industries was readjusted from 29 : 40.7 : 30.3 in 1995 to 23.3 : 42.7 : 34 in 2000 .  A new economic setup was taking shape under which the public ownership acted as the mainstay , diversified economic elements coexist , and non-public-owned economies were developing rapidly .  
Taking into account the general law governing the evolution of the industrial structures at home and abroad and the present conditions of the industrial development in Heilongjiang , our overall industrial structural orientation during the 10th Five-Year Plan period should be set on solidifying and improving the primary industry , optimizing and elevating the secondary industry , and accelerating the development of the tertiary industry .  
Second , the industrial structure will be adjusted , the process of industrialization will be quickened , the proportion of the secondary and tertiary industries in gross internal product will be raised to a level closer to the national average .  
In considering the selection of the decontamination methods , the consultants have taken into account the type , extent and spread of the contamination , prevailing work safety requirements , international standards on the level of soil contamination ; and the geographical setting of the contaminated areas and any possible secondary environmental impact on the neighbourhood .  
( c ) Apart from offering nine years ' free and universal basic education to all children between the ages of 6 and 15 , the Government has been raising the education level of the public through various measures .  For example , the Adult Education Section of the Education Department provides adult education at primary and secondary levels and English courses for interested persons aged 15 or above .  It also subvents non-government organisations in providing adult education courses , including literacy class .  
Seminars and experience-sharing sessions on environmental protection issues are jointly organised by the Education Department , other government departments and green groups on a regular basis for primary and secondary schools .  The main contents of these sessions include waste disposal .  
Major existing uses include a sports ground , an indoor recreational centre , a swimming pool , a special school , a health centre , a divisional police station , a fire and ambulance station , a Regional Services Department vehicle depot , as well as primary and secondary schools .  
As for the implementation of TOC in secondary schools , the Curriculum Development Council ( CDC ) has endorsed the incorporation of the conceptual framework of TOC into the future revision or updating of subject syllabi .  From 2001 , Subject Committees of Chinese , English and Mathematics will at their discretion incorporate TOC elements conducive to effective teaching and learning .  However , there is no plan to use TOA to replace the Junior Secondary Education Assessment ( JSEA ) or the public examinations at school certificate level , the spokesman stressed .  
( a ) whether , apart from giving hearing tests to all Primary One students at present , it provides such tests for primary and secondary school students in the regular medical examination conducted every year ; if it does , what the sense of hearing of students in Hong Kong is , as indicated in the results of those hearing tests in the past three years ; if not , the reasons for not providing such tests and whether they are related to administrative , technical and financial difficulties ; and  
The planned GIC uses include a swimming pool complex , a sports stadium , a training school and other facilities of the Immigration Department , water-related recreational facilities / holiday camps , social welfare uses , a wholesale marine fish market , indoor recreational centres , and primary and secondary schools .  
To progressively promote school-based management for the next triennium , the Government will provide each public sector school with an anuual supplementary grant to cope with the additioanl administrative work arising from school-based management ( on average , $ 120,000 per primary school and $ 155,000 per secondary school ) .  The full year additional recurrent expenditure incurred will be $ 165 million .  
A total of 38 new secondary schools will also be built in the four school years from 1999-2000 at a capital cost of $ 3.89 billion to meet the demand for additional school places .  The full year additional recurrent expenditure is $ 1.38 billion .  
The opening up of the Committee aimed at enhancing the transparency and credibility of the existing school allocation system by involving the participation of non-officials in the decision-making process , he said .

However , for those secondary school students who live in the Islands District , which covers an extensive area , the time required for travelling to some secondary schools within their school net but distant from their places of residence is often longer than that required for travelling to schools in an adjacent school net .  For example , it takes more time for students living in Tung Chung of Lantau Island to go to secondary schools on Ping Chau and Cheung Chau than to those in Tsing Yi , Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan .  
The competition will be divided into 16 sections and 92 classes , including scented pot-plant , orchids , Chinese cymbidium , potted plant , cacti and succulent , foliage plant , African violet , bonsai type plant , floral arrangement in the western and oriental manner , floral art by school children , school garden plot , primary and secondary school potted plant growing / nursing etc .

Regarding the proposals of the Education Commission to allocate 85 per cent of Primary One places on the principle of " vicinity " and to encourage primary and secondary schools to link among themselves to facilitate direct admission of Primary Six students to the linked secondary schools , there are comments that such proposals will result in more parents giving false residential addresses or moving to districts which fall within the school nets of their preferred schools so as to enhance the chance of their children being admitted to those schools .  
With nine years of free and universal education , every primary student is guaranteed a junior secondary school place .  Strictly speaking , there is no need for a high-stake selective public examination for the purpose of secondary school place allocation .

I have received a complaint in which a veteran Senior Graduate Master ( SGM ) who has changed his job from a Direct Subsidy Scheme secondary school to take up a Graduate Master ( " GM " ) post in an aided secondary school is paid a salary equivalent to the starting pay of a newly-inducted GM plus incremental credit for his recognized experience .  
Non-profit-making PISs are eligible for land grants at nominal premium and capital grants ( up to 100% of the cost of building a standard design primary or secondary public sector school of the same student population ) for the construction of school premises .  
" The advantages of a ' through-train ' school are that it ensures the continuity of the primary and secondary curriculum , strengthens the school 's understanding of and attention for its students , alleviates students ' adaptation problems upon their promotion to the secondary school and facilitates the arrangements for ' enhancement and remedial measures ' as well as ' cross level subject setting ' , " Mr Tai emphasised .  
" With respect to collaboration between linked primary and secondary schools , the ED recommends that at the initial stage of development , the primary and secondary schools forming ' through-trains ' should still be considered as separate entities in fund allocation and financial arrangements , staff establishment , and school management . "  " They will not be treated as a new type of schools .  
Our tertiary , secondary and primary education will become better and better , and the trend for lifelong learning will become even stronger through Government encouragement and the active support and participation of the people .  All these efforts in the education sector will no doubt enable us to meet the needs of our social and economic development in the 21st Century .  
That is why in our education reforms , while continuing to make primary and secondary education even more widely available , while committing to improve the quality of our entire public school system , we have also put in place the important initiative to enhance the competitiveness of direct subsidy scheme schools , and to help more private schools to meet the diverse quality needs of different parents and students .

Before 1973 the primary and secondary students began classes at the same time . Now that the parents have been through grades 1-12 under the same roof , the elementary and junior / senior high schoolers have separate daily flag ceremonies , with the national anthem resounding four times .  
When asked what qualities they expected in members of the anti-corruption movement , as many as 40% replied that it was enough for them to act fairly and cleanly in office ; their origins and background , posts held with commercial enterprises and their morality in their private lives were all secondary considerations . Thus it seems that the requirements the public in Taiwan places on its politicians are fairly reasonable and equitable .  
Major infrastructure projects cost a lot of money and are not easy to bring on line , but when all is said and done these ravenous monsters will steadily leave the stage , or will become of only secondary importance , and leave most of the budgetary pie to others . What really seems " an unending drain that can never be controlled " is that part of the budget which elicits the most extreme emotions both for and against , social welfare .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
For example , in 1964 the MOP stated that in order to develop science and technology , if it proved impossible to find qualified persons at home , foreign nationals could be hired on a contract basis for scientific or technical posts which did not involve national secrets . In 1984 the MOE declared that secondary and tertiary institutions could employ foreign nationals .  
If hypnotic states are mental psycho-spiritual phenomena shared by all of humanity , then why is hypnosis almost never used in modern Chinese medicine , whereas in the West , which puts so much stock on scientific proof , hypnosis has already become an established secondary treatment ?  
When two candidates are on an equal footing based on primary considerations , secondary factors become decisive . These include provincial , ethnic and class origin . Even physical appearance is n't overlooked .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
Quite the opposite from what outsiders suspected , the principal reason for prolonging talks was in fact claims of " unfair commercial advantages . " The seemingly sensitive questions of sovereignty and political rivalry were actually secondary .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality .

In truth , the primary and secondary mathematics curricula that everyone is familiar with , both in the West and here in Asia , has the same roots : the Industrial Revolution .

Even in the 1960s , after the advent of universal education , the purpose of math education was to train scientists .  
With the trend towards the concentration of medical treatment in hospitals , rates of in-hospital infection have risen greatly . Lien Te-cheng , an attending physician in the Department of Respiratory Therapy at Taipei 's Veterans General Hospital , suggests that it is best if in-patients are discharged as soon as they are 70% recovered , because somebody just recovering from a major illness is much more vulnerable to any secondary infection which they might contract in hospital .  
They could take the kneaded clay , wrap it on the outside of the shards , and tap it down lightly with a wooden stick to make the clay more compact and solid . The stick would have patterns carved into it which would then be left imprinted on the clay . But this decorative effect , thinks Cheng , was probably secondary to the functional purpose of compacting the clay .  
" Let me take you soaring over a stretch of green fields / Piercing a tunnel of greenery bathed in the setting sun / Let the cool breeze and the fragrance of oranges run through your fingers / Cast off your worries and let your mind go free .

Would n't they fail to reach their warm breeding grounds to propagate their young ? In Sweden , where environmental education is well developed , outdoor education in elementary and secondary schools goes something like this : Students select a lakeside for long-term observation of changes to its plants , insects , water and shoreline , and try to find the causes for environmental ills . Some schools go to nearby islands for fieldwork , and teachers lead students to sit on the cliffs , experience the ocean and write poetry to express their feelings .
