Over the past two years , China 's enterprises have drawn lessons from some international prevailing practices and begun to use the antidumping and antisubsidy means to safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests .  The Jilin Paper Manufacturing Group and other eight enterprises ' application for the antidumping investigation into the imported newsprint was China 's first antidumping case , which has been wound up now , and the substantive loss caused by the dumping of import goods was diminished .  
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in early 1998 , with the joint efforts made by both sides , relations between China and South Africa have been developing smoothly , and substantive progress has been made in the cooperation between the two countries with broad prospects being shown .

She even brazenly denied the common knowledge , universally recognized by the international community and known even to women and children , that Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times , and is still talking about seeking " substantive diplomacy " in the " joint rule of two sexes . "  Is she not asking the people of Taiwan to ride a horse blindfolded and approach the deep pond in the middle of the night ?  
During the Gulf War , with their indomitable information superiority and firepower superiority , the multinational force headed by the United States carried out integrated strikes of soft interference and suppression and hard , substantive destruction against Iraq that were compound , consecutive and highly intensive .  This opened people 's eyes to not only the " remnants " of mechanized war but also the new features of informationized war .  
The people 's democratic dictatorship as a form of state and the people 's congress system as a form of government of what our country has been pursuing are the result of the people 's struggle and a historical choice made by the people .  They are the corner stone of our country 's political system which not only suits our country 's national conditions but also reflects the substantive requirements of socialism .  
Only when substantive headway is made in structural adjustment can the quality of economic growth be heightened and China 's social productive forces be raised to a new level .

The reason is : in a foreseeable period to come , there will be no major change in the international strategic structure , and there will be no major breakthrough in Sino-US relations .  The United States will not make substantive adjustment of its strategy against China . Taiwan 's status as a chessman in the global strategy of the United States will not be shaken , and Taiwan 's role as a counter will not be weakened .  
The crucial reason why substantive progress was rarely made in Palestinian-Israeli talks and even the entire Middle East peace process was that many of the agreements were unilaterally laid aside and neglected by Israel and the Palestinian , and Arab masses ' disappointment over the prospects for the peace talks caused the resurgence and aggravation of violent activities , which in turn added to Israel 's policy of high-handedness and blockade to bring about a nonstop vicious circle of retaliation and counter-retaliation by the two sides .  
Political reform not only has been affecting and constraining progress of the economic reform , but also has been affecting and constraining substantive progress in building democracy and the rule of law , as well as affecting and constraining the building of an effective power supervision and constraining mechanism needed to step up anti-corruption efforts , and affecting and constraining the maintenance and development of social stability and realization of long-term peace and stability .  Therefore , the task of reform of China 's political system is heavy and the way ahead is long .  
Analysts here believe that the participants did not produce any substantive decision on promoting global economic growth , and did not take any significant action on reducing and waiving debts , while the global health fund did not propose solutions for the high cost of drugs and backward medical conditions in poor countries .

Previously , some individual investors felt they were being deceived by the speculation in reorganized stock market assets .  Usually when the substantive conditions of stocks was made public , the stock prices of the reorganized stocks had risen due to speculation .  The investment value became overdrawn .  Some investors or misguided people who were becoming firmly entangled complained that they had suffered losses because the market information was not transparent and that was unfair .  
As a matter of fact , we did not make any substantive adjustment to the tax preferential policies toward foreign investors .  In 1997 , we intended to adjust the tax referential policy in terms of import equipment , but owing to the changes in macroeconomic situation such as the Asian financial crisis , we suspended the policy adjustment .

To counter the problems that exist in the implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law , Hou Zongbin said , further efforts should be made to solve the problems of ideological understanding in a bid to genuinely change the erroneous law-enforcement concepts that exist among a considerable number of units and public security cadres and officers , such as " valuing a substantive law more than a procedural law , " and foster a law-enforcement concept of laying equal emphasis on both the substantive law and the procedural law .  
The two delegations made the visit exactly after the Taiwan authorities announced the opening of goods and personnel exchanges between Kinmen and Matsu on one side and the coastal areas of Fujian on the other .

While increasing their traditional commodity trade , the enterprises will also gradually expand economic and technological cooperation and reciprocal investments , and will especially advance their joint-venture cooperation in the high-tech field .  This will not only enhance the level of economic and trade cooperation and enrich the contents of cooperation , but will also bring about greater economic benefits to both sides .  This time , a batch of Chinese entrepreneurs with substantive economic strength joined the visit , and this won good comments from the five host countries .  
The deputies were of the opinion that the NPC standing committee 's work report delivered by NPC Chairman Li Peng has a substantive content , highlights priorities , focuses strongly on specific issues , is factual and truthful in its summary of the NPC standing committee 's work in the past year , and maps out inspiring plans for this year 's work .  
Speaking on the legislation for environmental protection , Qu Geping said : The NPC Standing Committee of the last two terms has drawn up the Flood Control Law , the law for controlling solid wastes from polluting the environment , and other laws .

As mayor of Taipei and then as governor of Taiwan , whether faced with hectoring legislators or a recalcitrant citizenry , he always managed to turn dissension into harmony and get " good marks . " Many people may not know that he first earned the favorable notice of the reform-minded Mr . Chiang for a bold and substantive critical report that he made on agricultural policy as a consultant with the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction .  
Foreign Minister Lien Chan expressed his desire to use " realistic , flexible , and forward-looking methods " to break through the current reliance on substantive foreign relations and to " establish formal diplomatic relations with ever country in the world " as well as to improve substantive relations .  
However , although formal diplomatic ties have been severed between the United States and our country during the last ten years , substantive relations have not only been maintained , but enhanced immeasurably . This is mainly due to interests shared by the two nations , along with broad support from the American and Chinese people .  
Some countries have formal diplomatic relations with us and some do not , but the countries that do not all have a number of substantive relations with us , such as economic and trade ties , scientific and technological cooperation , athletic and cultural exchanges , a whole host of them .  
It may sound odd , but here it is : Although the Nien genealogy clearly states that they are descended from the Jurchen , as far as the people of the Nien Clan Village are concerned , being identified as the heirs of Ahguda seems only to have occasional symbolic meaning , with little substantive impact .  
Liu , like Chen I-hsin , argues that Taiwan 's successful completion of the presidential election under the threat of mainland missiles attracted tremendous international attention , and the situation worked greatly to Taiwan 's advantage . It 's just that Taiwan should first move toward international organizations - - such as the World Trade Organization or regional security forums - - of more substantive importance and where there are fewer obstacles . For the time being , the high-cost , low-return effort to get into the UN should be put aside . The latent cross-strait crisis  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
Government officials also paid considerable attention to the debate . Premier Vincent Siew said that it looks as if the DPP 's policy orientation toward the PRC is not much different from the government 's current policy in focusing on substantive issues , exchanges , and equal negotiations . If the DPP can achieve an internal consensus , and if the various political parties can achieve consensus among themselves , in future negotiations with the PRC , Taiwan can present a unified position .  
At the tenth anniversary of Tiananmen , preventive measures by the mainland authorities made substantive attacks against the government impossible . But participants in a symposium on " The May Fourth Movement and 20th-Century China " at Peking University in early May could scarcely fail to expand on the stated theme , to touch on the currently most sensitive topics of democracy , human rights and freedom which were the issues behind Tiananmen . Hence the symposium was full of the sense that " all history is contemporary history . "  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
Further , critics say that the series of suspenseful spy-vs . - spy-like episodes ensuing over the course of Lu 's jaunt violated established norms of diplomatic behavior , leaving potential new allies at a loss and making them reluctant to undertake any substantive exchanges with Taiwan .  
Based on this premise , any approach which promises to further the substantive objective of Taiwan 's " standing up tall and striding out into the world " - be it holiday diplomacy , economic and trade diplomacy , cultural diplomacy , transit diplomacy , political party-to-party diplomacy or whatever the case and terminology may be-is worth a try .  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response .

The Council 's current practices , characterized by the closed and secret nature of the vast majority of the substantive deliberations of its members , make it ever more necessary to meet our demand for an analytical , complete and integral report .  
It should maintain institutional memory and develop doctrine , standard operating procedures and operationality in this area , and have primary responsibility for substantive guidance and support of the electoral component of future peacekeeping missions .  
This programme is based on joint endeavours initiated by UNDP but led by participating countries and with a substantive participation of external partners , including bilateral donors and international and regional institutions and organizations .

I also stressed that the international community would not invest additional human and material resources and risk lives in peacekeeping operations where political will did not make a substantive contribution to the peace process .  
The idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law is worth considering as a transitional measure , although the manner in which this is effected will require deliberate study .  
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled " Process of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons " and " Review of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade " would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session .  
That revision offered us substantive additional support for the implementation of activities planned within the framework of the national development strategy , in particular effective activities related to the structural adjustment programme , the public sector reform programme and the regional integration programme .  
There is extraordinary cooperation on the part of States , other political entities and non-governmental organizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern of the United Nations organs ; in the burgeoning , multidimensional sphere of sustainable development ; in the territory where humane concerns and values , social ordering and cultural norms coalesce ; and in the field of peace-keeping , of providing States and peoples with security from violence and disorder .  
We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
The coordination segment can be considerably improved through expeditious and effective implementation of the agreed conclusions of this year 's substantive session on coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the outcomes of major United Nations conferences in the economic , social and related fields .  
This is why it is imperative that both exercises should result in a final break with regrettable strategies aimed at turning procedural questions and an accrued demand for reform into prerequisites preventing all possibility of substantive debate about the real stakes and about problems affecting the operational capabilities of the United Nations to realize its enormous potential to support economic and social development in developing countries .  
Moreover , the shared approaches that have characterized these last few years do not in themselves resolve many of the substantive problems of the international system , such as those pertaining to collective security , economic and social development and the defence of the perennial values that guarantee a worthy and peaceful life for peoples and individuals .  
At its organizational session , the Commission also decided that the items entitled \ x { e4f8 } rocess of nuclear disarmament in the framework of international peace and security , with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons and \ x { e4fa } eview of the Declaration of the 1990s as the Third Disarmament Decade would be concluded at its 1995 substantive session .

Decides to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ;  
On the other hand , some delegations held the view that there was an inseparable link between the procedural law contained in the draft statute and the substantive law of the draft Code , and suggested that , for the Court to function effectively , it was essential to complete the work of the draft Code , which would substantially clarify the Court 's jurisdiction ratione materiae .  
The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
The above notwithstanding , the wording of subparagraph ( c ) providing that the Court should apply " to the extent applicable , any rule of national law " was considered as too vague by some representatives , who called for more specific language bearing in mind that international law did not yet contain a complete statement of substantive and procedural criminal law . 
By 21 February , a total of 211 international staff members from 36 countries had joined the Mission , comprising 111 substantive staff , of whom 72 are United Nations Volunteers , 60 administrative and logistical support staff , 10 military liaison officers and 30 civilian police observers .  
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
The revised timetable provides for completion of two main substantive issues ( economic and social issues and the agrarian situation ; and strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society ) before the electoral campaign is fully under way .  
At consultations held in 1994 at Bellagio , Italy , and Coppet , Switzerland , on the theme " Refocusing UNEP " , it was concluded that UNEP should reorient its current programme , emphasize strategic and intellectual leadership rather than operational activities and develop the substantive and managerial capacity to catalyse external resources effectively .  
The progress report focused on prerequisites of learning from experience with United Nations peace-keeping operations , and on the status of a ready capacity to act for six substantive components of complex missions : information , electoral , repatriation , human rights , civilian police and military .  
Bearing in mind , however , that under paragraph 2 of General Assembly resolution 49 / 53 , the arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries are to be considered by the Ad Hoc Committee in the light of its review of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the Commission 's draft , the Secretary-General considers it premature to make proposals on the procedural and organizational aspects of the convening of the conference . 
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 49 / 53 and the relevant request of the Legal Counsel , UNDCP and CPCJB have reviewed the draft statute for an international criminal court contained in the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-sixth session .  3 / The review was carried out in the light of the legislative mandates of both bodies and from the point of view of their substantive competence .

This ignorance of norms is compounded by deficiencies of legal interpretation and reasoning , as evidenced in the literal and disjointed application of ordinary law and a marked emphasis on procedural - as opposed to substantive - issues .  
The activities to be carried out in the biennium 1996-1997 under the three subprogrammes of programme 12 of the medium-term plan for the period 1992-1997 , as revised ( A / 47 / 6 / Rev . 1 ) , will emphasize assistance to developing countries in improving their development planning systems and policies in support of national development through provision of advisory services to Governments upon their request and substantive and operational support to technical cooperation projects .

It is India 's considered view that before the Security Council embarks on any action to formally give itself a " role in the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction " , all substantive , legal and institutional issues , including the role of specific treaty bodies , must be addressed and resolved through an open and transparent debate among the full membership of the United Nations .

It should be noted that , had the total estimated requirement for substantive activities been approved , including training and human resources development , information and documentation services , joint activities and advisory services amounting to $ 434,858.44 , the budgetary distribution in the form of percentages of both administrative expenditure and substantive services would have been meaningful and well distributed .  
Also , in this regard , following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ( April 1994 ) , which included agriculture for the first time in a substantive fashion , there has been a growing interest by developing countries in coming to grips with the changed international trading environment for agriculture and FAO has been developing a programme to respond to this need .

In particular , it was recommended that States examine the experience of countries that have confronted organized crime and the intelligence derived from the analysis of its structures and criminal activities , as useful guiding principles concerning which substantive , procedural and regulatory legislation and organizational structures are necessary to combat the phenomenon .

The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
The above notwithstanding , the wording of subparagraph ( c ) providing that the Court should apply " to the extent applicable , any rule of national law " was considered as too vague by some representatives , who called for more specific language bearing in mind that international law did not yet contain a complete statement of substantive and procedural criminal law .

They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .

At consultations held in 1994 at Bellagio , Italy , and Coppet , Switzerland , on the theme " Refocusing UNEP " , it was concluded that UNEP should reorient its current programme , emphasize strategic and intellectual leadership rather than operational activities and develop the substantive and managerial capacity to catalyse external resources effectively .
