The Committee took note with appreciation of the efforts of ACC to promote a coordinated and integrated system-wide approach to the follow-up to major international conferences through ad hoc inter-agency task forces , and requested that the results of the comprehensive assessment of the work of the task forces to be carried out by ACC in 1997 should be included in the next annual overview report of ACC .  
Many of the overall civilian implementation tasks coordinated by my Office , such as the building of common institutions , supporting economic reconstruction , creating communications and transport links between the entities , and providing a basis for a functioning civil society are fundamental to creating the necessary conditions for the return of displaced persons and refugees .  
Recognizing also that coordinated follow _ up implies that the major conferences should be viewed as interlinked and contributing to an integrated framework of and a global partnership for development ; in this context , major cross _ cutting themes established in the world conferences need to be identified and built upon ,  
These include weak domestic employment capacity , uneven sectoral growth , weak intersectoral articulation , severe marketing bottlenecks , poorly coordinated and fragmented new investments in both public and private ventures and structural imbalances among macroeconomic aggregates .  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .

The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
In the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of a major conference , the Council was requested to ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .

Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
Preliminary reviews of the 1998 resident coordinator annual reports and UNDAF pilot exercises shows that thematic groups work more effectively when linked to or the result of combined efforts of major / key stakeholders to develop a framework for a coordinated and integrated country-level response to cross-cutting themes derived from major international conferences .  
In particular , the introduction and implementation of common country assessments and UNDAFs , by providing a framework for a consistent and coordinated interaction among national priorities and international objectives as identified by global conferences and possible United Nations system response , is expected to contribute to more integrated United Nations system support for conference follow-up and to redefine and enhance the work of thematic groups accordingly .  
ACC will undertake the required steps to give full effect to the relevant provisions of the resolution dealing with the coordinated follow-up to global conferences , gender in development , technical cooperation among developing countries , capacity-building , cooperation with civil society , supporting countries involved in various stages of relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , regional dimensions of development , national execution and monitoring , and evaluation . 
IACWGE continues its work to develop practical support for gender mainstreaming . 20 In a number of other areas , as proposed by CCPOQ , it would be important to further fine tune the cross-cutting themes identified at the world conferences , starting from the 12 themes agreed by the Council ( see E / 1995 / 86 ) with a view to identifying more selective and better defined issues that would benefit from a coordinated approach and supportive tools . 
Important progress has been made during the last year by the United Nations system at the country level , especially through a greater and more effective use of thematic groups as instruments to support national efforts for the coordinated follow-up to major global conferences in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , and through the use of such frameworks as the common country assessment and UNDAF .  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
The Economic and Social Council , pursuant to decision 1998 / 290 of 31 July 1998 , taken at its substantive session of 1998 , held a two-day informal meeting on basic indicators for the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of the major United Nations conferences .  
As expressed in the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning , the Programming Aspects of the Budget , the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation , the purpose of the instruments is to ensure that activities are coordinated and that available resources are utilized according to legislative intent and in the most effective and economic manner ( regulation 2.2 ) .  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
As an ongoing matter of global concern that deals with major cross-cutting aspects of development , disaster prevention needs to be linked to all the relevant conclusions of the key United Nations conferences of the 1990s in order to implement strategies for reducing disaster losses in a coordinated , sustained approach for a safer twenty-first century .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
The Council may also wish to decide that in developing future multi-year work programmes of individual functional commissions , these programmes should be coordinated with those of other functional commissions in such a manner that the themes and issues that will be considered or have been already decided for consideration by these commissions can be addressed from different perspectives in the same calendar year .  
Developing coordinated , integrated and balanced approaches to health delivery , including reproductive health care , requires good teamwork and strong leadership as well as shared vision , and partnerships with civil society and the private sector need to be strengthened .

The challenges are multifaceted and involve a range of economic , social , educational , judicial and disarmament issues all of which must be addressed in an integrated , coordinated way .  
In the economic and social sphere , it is important to mention that our national efforts were complemented by international cooperation through the establishment of a special economic cooperation plan for Central America adopted by the General Assembly and implemented and coordinated by the United Nations Development Programme with the cooperation of other specialized agencies of the system .  
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework , which has been designed to provide the format for continuing United Nations teamwork in responding to the development priorities of specific countries , will play an essential role in identifying needs regarding the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights and providing coordinated response to them .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
The global economic situation : Difficult economic conditions , including high rates of unemployment as well as inadequate social investment , obsolete infrastructures and poor delivery of essential services to the population , are also hampering the development of a coordinated social policy for family and children in many countries ;  
The conference , for this purpose , should consider the main factors leading and contributing to the excessive accumulation of small arms and may adopt a plan of action consisting of specific coordinated efforts by the international community to reduce and prevent illicit trafficking as well as to face and resolve the problems associated with the excessive accumulation of small arms .  
On this basis , I am confident that an appropriate mechanism will be found to meet the aspirations of the Government of Haiti as well as the desire of the international community to elaborate a long-term , coordinated and well-managed plan for Haiti 's sustainable social , economic and institutional development .  
These are : insisting on the proposal to send an international security force ; adopting measures involving economic pressure on Indonesia at the multilateral and individual levels ; and providing , as quickly as possible , multifaceted , coordinated and duly protected international humanitarian assistance to the people .  
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .

Nationally and regionally coordinated strategies should be developed for the implementation of the mandates and recommendations contained in the Global Programme of Action adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session , 1 / on 23 February 1990 , the Tehran Declaration adopted by the Ministerial-level Conference at the twenty-ninth session of the Subcommission , held at Tehran in 1992 , and other relevant international drug control instruments ;  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
For that purpose , we intend to develop programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption and bribery , as a matter of high priority .  
Over the next five years , Malta planned to further strengthen the administrative and legislative means available to it to combat drug trafficking , sustain its opposition to the legalization of drugs , both hard and soft , involve all the actors of civil society in a coordinated strategy of prevention and education , enhance the drug-related services available for the family and the community , if necessary calling on the voluntary sector for assistance , and establish a continuous systematic evaluation exercise of the services offered in the preventive and therapeutic field .  
The Bretton Woods institutions had made a major step in that direction by endorsing the action programme of the initiative to reduce the debt burden of highly indebted poor countries ; under that initiative the three main groups of creditor countries had confirmed that they would take coordinated , simultaneous , but independent action , and would share the costs equitably ; they had also accepted a flexible structure and a case-by-case approach to take into account the characteristics of the economies of the heavily indebted poor countries .  
SFOR and its Civic Military Cooperation ( CIMIC ) Task Force has increased efforts to work with the Office of the High Representative and the international community on the media problems through several integrated working groups , sharing of resources and coordinated operations to develop means to counter blatant media bias and improve the populace 's ability to have alternative access to information .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
The project for the Dir district comprises six core activities : a coordinated approach to modifying and improving existing agricultural , livestock and agroforestry practices ; the phased introduction of direct contact with members of existing traditional community and interest groups in order to involve villagers in the identification , planning and implementation of activities ; the establishment of direct links between the project and the people through male and female social organizers ; human resources development through training in vocational skills ; the improvement of social services ; and the improvement of roads and electricity supplies .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .  
In adopting its agreed conclusions on the subject in 1995 , the Council took a major step forward by providing a coherent set of guidelines for developing a coordinated response to this global agenda at the intergovernmental as well as the inter-agency level .  
And as FAO has noted , the complex array of internal and external pressures acting on the fisheries sector call for responsible , timely , coordinated and comprehensive responses by national fishery administrations and regional fishery bodies if governance is to be strengthened .  
We believe that economic policies must be better coordinated with environmental policies and that the sustainability of our natural resources is essential , today and in the future , if we are to eliminate poverty and achieve equitable , just and participatory development throughout the world .  
Over the past year , the Secretariat has continued to work to ensure a coherent , well planned , coordinated and comprehensive approach to conflict situations , which makes use of political , social and developmental instruments .  
The Commission could urge relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
These activities are expected to contribute to the deepening of the regional cooperation and integration process in Africa , including effective trade liberalization , coordinated and convergent macroeconomic and sectoral policies , and to the promotion of increased investments in infrastructure development in the areas of transport and communication , energy and water and the exploration and exploitation of minerals through enhanced regional cooperation .  
A genuine commitment of all concerned parties at the national as well as the international level is needed to ensure a routine flow of reliable statistics and indicators at the country level , which meets national needs for information , and for the integrated and coordinated follow-up to global conferences and summits .  
The UNCTAD regular programme of technical cooperation will be coordinated to ensure an appropriate balance among developing regions with priority assigned to the specific needs of the least developed countries and other countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies . 
As the impact of the international economic environment upon the attainment of social development goals have been recognized by the international community , mutually agreed and coordinated measures to improve the functioning of the world economy have distinct social connotations .  
In the case of TCDC programmes initiated or coordinated by the Special Unit or by other bodies of the United Nations system , the involvement of multiple players in single TCDC interventions , which has now become common practice , would seem to indicate that the system is successfully adopting the mandate set out in the new directions strategy - i.e . , that TCDC activities should be designed to have the maximum impact on a large number of developing countries .  
Requests States to establish coordinated , participatory , transparent and accountable national policies and programmes for HIV / AIDS response and to translate national policies to district level and local action , involving in all phases of development and implementation non-governmental and community _ based organizations and people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue and intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;  
Requests States to establish coordinated , participatory , transparent and accountable national policies and programmes for HIV / AIDS response and to translate national policies to district level and local action , involving in all phases of development and implementation non-governmental and community _ based organizations and people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
Subregional , regional and international organizations and concerned countries to continue and intensify the coordinated efforts aimed at facilitating the national reconciliation process in Somalia , aware of the fact that the peaceful coexistence of all parties and groups is an important foundation for the respect of human rights ;  
The strategic framework is to comprise integrated and coordinated actions for addressing any combination of political , military , humanitarian , human rights , environmental , economic , social , cultural and demographic factors .  
Global programmes of action do provide overall blueprints for the activities in the various field of development initiatives , but they still need to be translated into a coordinated and integrated set of national normatives to be made operational at the country level ( for more detailed information on progress made towards an integrated and coordinated follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , see E / 1999 / 59 ) .  
Preliminary reviews of the 1998 resident coordinator annual reports and UNDAF pilot exercises shows that thematic groups work more effectively when linked to or the result of combined efforts of major / key stakeholders to develop a framework for a coordinated and integrated country-level response to cross-cutting themes derived from major international conferences .  
In particular , the introduction and implementation of common country assessments and UNDAFs , by providing a framework for a consistent and coordinated interaction among national priorities and international objectives as identified by global conferences and possible United Nations system response , is expected to contribute to more integrated United Nations system support for conference follow-up and to redefine and enhance the work of thematic groups accordingly .  
ACC will undertake the required steps to give full effect to the relevant provisions of the resolution dealing with the coordinated follow-up to global conferences , gender in development , technical cooperation among developing countries , capacity-building , cooperation with civil society , supporting countries involved in various stages of relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , regional dimensions of development , national execution and monitoring , and evaluation . 
IACWGE continues its work to develop practical support for gender mainstreaming . 20 In a number of other areas , as proposed by CCPOQ , it would be important to further fine tune the cross-cutting themes identified at the world conferences , starting from the 12 themes agreed by the Council ( see E / 1995 / 86 ) with a view to identifying more selective and better defined issues that would benefit from a coordinated approach and supportive tools . 
Important progress has been made during the last year by the United Nations system at the country level , especially through a greater and more effective use of thematic groups as instruments to support national efforts for the coordinated follow-up to major global conferences in accordance with General Assembly resolution 53 / 192 , and through the use of such frameworks as the common country assessment and UNDAF .  
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
The Economic and Social Council , pursuant to decision 1998 / 290 of 31 July 1998 , taken at its substantive session of 1998 , held a two-day informal meeting on basic indicators for the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of the major United Nations conferences .  
As expressed in the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning , the Programming Aspects of the Budget , the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation , the purpose of the instruments is to ensure that activities are coordinated and that available resources are utilized according to legislative intent and in the most effective and economic manner ( regulation 2.2 ) .  
The Commission , having recognized that the increasing interdependence of economies and the interconnected nature of computer systems call for concerted and coordinated action at the regional and global levels , urged all members and associate members to take early and effective action to bring their countries to the highest possible level of year 2000 ( Y2K ) readiness , not only for their own benefit but also to minimize adverse Y2K effects on vital sectors of other countries .  
As an ongoing matter of global concern that deals with major cross-cutting aspects of development , disaster prevention needs to be linked to all the relevant conclusions of the key United Nations conferences of the 1990s in order to implement strategies for reducing disaster losses in a coordinated , sustained approach for a safer twenty-first century .  
The coordinated cuts in interest rates in late 1998 proved effective in avoiding a further deterioration in the global economy at that time , but the global consequences of a move in the opposite direction are untested under the prevailing macroeconomic environment where a number of largely intangible factors , such as investor confidence , play such a critical role .  
The Council may also wish to decide that in developing future multi-year work programmes of individual functional commissions , these programmes should be coordinated with those of other functional commissions in such a manner that the themes and issues that will be considered or have been already decided for consideration by these commissions can be addressed from different perspectives in the same calendar year .  
Developing coordinated , integrated and balanced approaches to health delivery , including reproductive health care , requires good teamwork and strong leadership as well as shared vision , and partnerships with civil society and the private sector need to be strengthened .  
In its resolution 1999 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , the Economic and Social Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to submit recommendations to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , on how to ensure that the assistance of the international community in supporting the Government of Haiti to achieve sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
The challenges are multifaceted and involve a range of economic , social , educational , judicial and disarmament issues all of which must be addressed in an integrated , coordinated way .  
In the economic and social sphere , it is important to mention that our national efforts were complemented by international cooperation through the establishment of a special economic cooperation plan for Central America adopted by the General Assembly and implemented and coordinated by the United Nations Development Programme with the cooperation of other specialized agencies of the system .  
The United Nations Development Assistance Framework , which has been designed to provide the format for continuing United Nations teamwork in responding to the development priorities of specific countries , will play an essential role in identifying needs regarding the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights and providing coordinated response to them .  
In this connection , there is an obvious need for international legal regulation of the worldwide development of civilian and military information technology , and for the formulation of a coordinated international policy on information safety that meets the needs of international security .  
The global economic situation : Difficult economic conditions , including high rates of unemployment as well as inadequate social investment , obsolete infrastructures and poor delivery of essential services to the population , are also hampering the development of a coordinated social policy for family and children in many countries ;  
The conference , for this purpose , should consider the main factors leading and contributing to the excessive accumulation of small arms and may adopt a plan of action consisting of specific coordinated efforts by the international community to reduce and prevent illicit trafficking as well as to face and resolve the problems associated with the excessive accumulation of small arms .  
On this basis , I am confident that an appropriate mechanism will be found to meet the aspirations of the Government of Haiti as well as the desire of the international community to elaborate a long-term , coordinated and well-managed plan for Haiti 's sustainable social , economic and institutional development .  
These are : insisting on the proposal to send an international security force ; adopting measures involving economic pressure on Indonesia at the multilateral and individual levels ; and providing , as quickly as possible , multifaceted , coordinated and duly protected international humanitarian assistance to the people .  
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
This common approach both preventive and reactive is comprised of multiple and coordinated international , regional and national efforts that contribute to sustainable peace in areas prone or affected by conflict .  
By paying attention to the needs for a concerted action of the international community to address the regional dimensions of the root causes of conflict , the chapter calls for a coordinated regional approach that should be based on a set of agreed principles .

For purposes of creating the single economic space , the participating States shall take coordinated measures to bring the main social and macroeconomic indicators of development gradually closer together , and shall pursue a single structural policy .  
At the regional and subregional levels , the Office is undertaking a number of initiatives , including a joint project with the Council of Europe focusing on preventive activities for Central and Eastern Europe ; a range of activities in the former Yugoslavia coordinated by the human rights office in Sarajevo ; and a joint project with UNDP in Nepal focusing on the legal and judicial aspects of controlling trafficking .  
The report takes comprehensive stock of the activities carried out and the resolutions adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union ( IPU ) as part of its coordinated and effective support for the work of the United Nations in its principal areas of authority , including peace and security , human rights and economic and social development .  
In their recent joint declaration , the Presidents of the Central American countries expressed their resolve to undertake coordinated action on such crucial issues as protecting the human rights of migrants , combating drug trafficking and moving forward towards regional economic integration .  
Policies should aim to ensure the integration of social services into a system that combines a wide range of different services that are accessible and coordinated with each other and thus provide complementary help and support.The services should be of adequate quality , sensitive to the needs of the service users , and delivered in an innovative , efficient and cost-effective way . 
The Commission urges relevant institutions , whether national , regional or global , to enhance collaboration with each other , taking into account their respective mandates , with a view to promoting coordinated approaches , avoiding duplication of effort , enhancing effective functioning of existing organizations , and ensuring better access to information and broadening its dissemination .  
18 . Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
In this context , our country has firmly resolved to work with the whole of the international community and to contribute to the continuing improvement of the global and coordinated strategy defined by the Ottawa process for the complete elimination of the scourge of anti _ personnel mines .  
The laudable initiative of convening a special session on the integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits should be continued on an annual basis ; debates should focus on themes agreed in the substantive session , taking into account the need to balance action and experience at the national level with the results and requirements of international cooperation .  
During the session of the Council on integrated and coordinated implementation and follow-up of major United Nations conferences and summits , held in May 1998 , the Council had proved that it was playing an important role in the guidance and oversight of its subsidiary bodies ; it had identified , inter alia , poverty eradication as the overriding objective of its efforts and had recognized the need to address the problem of declining resources for the implementation of conferences .  
I have the honour to refer to Economic and Social Council resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 in which the Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council at its substantive session of 1999 recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
As you are aware , the Economic and Social Council , by its resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 , decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
Therefore , what is proposed is a decentralized technical , administrative and budgetary approach to a globally coordinated collaborative facilities management based on information exchange and common operational practices is therefore proposed .  
An integrated , collaborative and coordinated approach to facilities policy , administrative and budgetary information exchange is being formulated to promote effective and efficient planning , management , maintenance and operation for all Headquarters and overseas physical facilities of the Organization .  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with volunteer expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Finally , the active involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions both in the final event and in the preparatory process was crucial : only through the coordinated efforts of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions would the common objective of poverty reduction and sustainable development be achieved .  
The key to fulfilment of those noble objectives and plans of action was financing for development , and it was imperative that a coordinated international effort should be made to address the problems faced by developing countries and to enhance their capacities to play a more active role in the world economy .  
We know that this can only be done if all the people concerned , at the local , national , regional and international levels , are fully committed through joint and coordinated efforts and actions .  
We understand that it demands coordinated and concerted efforts on the multilateral level and requires a thorough study of the political , military and economic aspects , in particular States legitimate defence and security needs .  
The General Assembly is the global institution with the competence to look at ocean affairs in a coordinated manner , integrating all aspects of ocean uses : political , legal , economic , social , environmental and technical .  
Without coordinated international efforts , illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing will severely undermine the economic base , food security and , above all , human security of coastal States , and in particular small island developing States .  
The Strategy presents an innovative , proactive and coordinated approach to halt and reverse the degradation of biological and landscape diversity values in Europe and to promote the integration of such considerations into social and economic sectors .  
At an international level , coordinated taxation of international capital flows and support for universal human rights to minimal standards of living would also contribute to improving income distribution .  
All these initiatives are aimed at adopting joint coordinated action at the international , regional and national levels with a view to contributing to establishing lasting peace in regions threatened or affected by conflicts .  
The elimination of this scourge requires vigorous , coordinated international action so that the illicit trafficking in light weapons stops devastating civilian populations and causing humanitarian crises throughout the world .  
The Council further stressed the importance of a coordinated international response to economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems , which are often the root causes of armed conflicts .  
Those causes should be addressed in a coherent , well planned , coordinated and comprehensive manner with political , social and developmental instruments .  
( We also invite them to develop ) ( Integrated , coherent / coordinated ) and gender sensitive social , economic and environmental ( policies / approaches ) ( are required / in order ) to close the gap between goals and achievements .  
An institutional focal point at the national level , with its counterparts at decentralized levels , enables a country to evolve a coherent and coordinated approach with the involvement of relevant entities in the public and private sectors , and with NGOs .  
The report demonstrates that coordinated implementation of the environmental conventions is essential at the local level , where it is possible to make a significant difference and where tangible benefits are not only easily achievable but also demonstrable .  
We are aware that the challenge posed by the pandemic requires an intensified coordinated response not just at the national level but at the regional and indeed global levels as well .  
In the light of the vital importance of effective and coordinated implementation of international human rights instruments , the efforts of various treaty bodies to attain an integrated and balanced administration of rights was particularly welcome .  
As provided for by the Offices terms of reference , UNTOPs activities during the past year have focused on the consolidation of peace ; political support for efforts to mobilize international resources and assistance for national recovery and reconstruction ; promotion of the rule of law and the strengthening of democratic institutions ; support for local human rights initiatives ; and promotion of coordinated and focused effort by the United Nations system in the country in matters related to peace-building .  
We agree that there is need for a further coordinated approach , particularly provided by UNMIK , to overcome the dangerous challenges , including inadequate physical , social and economic security for the ethnic communities in Kosovo , alongside a lack of freedom of movement and equal access to public services .  
In its agreed conclusions 2000 / 2 of 27 July 2000 , on the integrated and coordinated follow-up to major United Nations conferences , the Council invited its relevant functional commissions to consider a number of options listed in paragraph 33 of the report of the Secretary-General ( E / 2000 / 57 ) for enhancing the reviews of the major United Nations conferences and summits and to inform the Council for its consideration at its substantive session in 2001 of the outcome of their discussion .  
The Council therefore strongly encouraged Governments to pursue and strengthen their efforts to work towards achieving the goals of poverty eradication and reiterated the call for the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and the international community to take consistent , coherent , coordinated and joint action in support of national efforts to eradicate poverty , with particular attention to employment creation and work and the empowerment and advancement of women .  
The recent call by industrial countries for coordinated international policy action in the face of rising oil prices was to be welcomed , but it contrasted sharply with the indifference to similar calls from the developing world when faced with the devastating consequences of falling commodity prices .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Convinced that the drug problem needs to be addressed in a coordinated , comprehensive , balanced and integrated manner , involving both supply and demand reduction , in accordance with the measures adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together ,  
Emphasis will be given to ensuring a more timely and better coordinated response to situations calling for humanitarian assistance in the event of natural disasters and complex emergencies , providing improved support to the resident or humanitarian coordinators and implementing field-based strategic planning for the common humanitarian assistance plans of the United Nations .  
In 2000 , the review of the coordinated implementation of Agenda 21 concluded that difficulties faced by the United Nations system could be attributed to constraints such as lack of financial resources , inadequate institutional capacity , cumbersome reporting relationships and inconsistent decision-making by the governing bodies of United Nations agencies ( A / 55 / 78 , para .  58 ) .  
Considering that action against the world drug problem is a shared responsibility calling for coordinated and balanced action consistent with the relevant multilateral instruments in force at the international level ,  
Convinced that the drug problem needs to be addressed in a coordinated , comprehensive , balanced and integrated manner , involving both supply and demand reduction , in accordance with the measures adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session , devoted to countering the world drug problem together ,  
Objective : To ensure timely and effective administrative and logistical support to peacekeeping operations , as well as other activities in the field authorized by the United Nations , and an effective , proactive and coordinated response to threats from landmines and unexploded ordnance .  
Convinced that each State must adopt a strategy consistent with its resources and capacities to achieve its individual goals in implementing the recommendations contained in the Rome Declaration and Plan of Action of the World Food Summit and , at the same time , cooperate regionally and internationally in order to organize collective solutions to global issues of food security in a world of increasingly interlinked institutions , societies and economies , where coordinated efforts and shared responsibilities are essential ,  
At the national level , this will require ministries / government agencies and central banks responsible for different international and regional organizations and involved in their norm-setting / policy-making to become more coordinated and to increase coherence among themselves when discussing and deciding on such common goals and approaches in the governing bodies of the United Nations , IFIs and other international and regional organizations .  
In Economic and Social Council resolution 2000 / 35 , the Council decided to invite executive heads of relevant organizations of the United Nations system and heads of other relevant international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments to form a collaborative partnership on forests to support the work of UNFF and to enhance cooperation and coordination among participants , and facilitate and promote coordinated and cooperative action , including joint programming .  
How best to enhance cooperation between donors and recipient countries so that resources are available on a timely basis to respond to improvements in domestic policies and the ensuing opportunities for investments in areas key to the achievement of Millennium Summit goals and other internationally agreed targets , through the development of comprehensive poverty reduction strategies by developing countries and matching commitments from donors for coordinated and harmonized support ?  
These harmful conflicts are breaking out and are becoming genuine threats to peace precisely at a time when what is required , more than ever , is coordinated and effective action by the international community , with all the necessary resources to address the very serious social and economic problems facing us .  
Affirming that responses to climate change should be coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated manner with a view to avoiding adverse impacts on the latter , taking into full account the legitimate priority needs of developing countries for the achievement of sustained economic growth and the eradication of poverty ,  
Much work will be needed at the national level to transform the National Programmes of Action into real instruments for national development planning , linking them with the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper ( PRSP ) process and ensuring that the United Nations Development Group ( UNDG ) , the World Bank and the major bilateral donors act in a coordinated fashion at the national level , and in a manner that is consistent with the commitments made in the global Programme of Action .  
The incumbent will be responsible for overall planning , review of field mission budget requirements , resource planning , engineering designs for horizontal and vertical construction , inclusive of modular / prefabricated facilities , and general oversight on and coordinated execution of the mandated engineering programme and related support activities in the peacekeeping operations , ensuring that effective support is rendered in a timely and economical manner .  
We must pledge today in a joint , coordinated and concerted way , and for the medium and long term as is expected of this Organization , to fulfil our moral , legal and political obligation to construct , for ourselves and for future generations , a legacy of democracy , freedom , peace and security .  
The key to attaining this objective lies in taking measures geared to halting and reversing the deterioration of physical infrastructure in landlocked and transit developing countries , continuing support for policy , legislative and institutional reforms at the national and regional levels , including coordinated and collaborative human resource development , and enhancing international cooperation . 
The panellists hoped that the coordinated monetary stimulus by the major developed countries , as well as the supportive fiscal measures , would lessen the negative impact of the attacks and strengthen economic recovery .  
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
Invites the Secretary-General , the Economic and Social Council , the Commission for Social Development , the regional commissions , the relevant agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental forums , within their respective mandates , to take on a priority basis and in a coordinated manner all steps necessary to ensure the effective implementation of all commitments and undertakings contained in the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action and in the further initiatives for social development , and to continue to be actively involved in their follow-up ;  
Reaffirms that the follow-up to the World Summit for Social Development and the relevant special session will be undertaken on the basis of an integrated approach to social development and within the framework of a coordinated follow-up to major international conferences and summits in the economic , social and related fields and , in this regard , takes note of Economic and Social Council resolution 2001 / 21 of 26 July 2001 , on integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to major United Nations conferences and summits ;  
Its commitment included the adoption of firm and coordinated measures to achieve economic and social development based on decent employment , sound education and comprehensive health services for the most needy sectors .  
It revealed , in particular , that without a coordinated global policy response , the slowing of the United States economy would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy ; that on the eve of the events of 11 September , global economic conditions had already been deteriorating , and that for the first time since the end of the 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously experiencing slower growth , because the major industrialized countries were exporting their recession through trade and financial linkages .  
Expresses its appreciation for the commendable progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with voluntary expertise to respond , in a quick and coordinated manner , to humanitarian relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , while preserving the non-political , neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action ;  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;  
Encourages , at the national level , the active involvement of all government agencies responsible for economic development , social development and environmental protection , and invites them to provide coordinated inputs and contributions to the preparatory process of the Summit ;  
Notes that country-driven programming offers additional opportunities for greater use of technical cooperation among developing countries modalities by programme countries , and reiterates its call on the United Nations system to take more concerted and coordinated measures to improve the effective incorporation of technical cooperation among developing countries into their programmes and projects and to intensify efforts , including by developing specific mechanisms to mainstream this modality into the United Nations coordination frameworks in collaboration with the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries of the United Nations Development Programme , and all other relevant international institutions ;  
The science , engineering and technology community will increase its legitimacy at the national and international levels by operating in a coordinated , transparent , balanced , and merit-based way , and providing inputs that are credible , independent and valid .
