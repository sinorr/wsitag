If the General Assembly decided to implement the composite post adjustment for Geneva , the organizations concerned should be requested to make the necessary changes in their respective staff rules , and should be given sufficient time to do so ; otherwise , further inequities could result , which would be tantamount to a break-up of the common system .  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
The Advisory Committee was not provided with adequate justification for the posts being requested in relation to the programme of work for the completion of all outstanding areas of the peace accords mentioned in paragraph 3 of the statement of the Secretary-General on programme budget implications ( i.e . , public security , land transfer , human settlements , reinsertion programmes , protection of the wounded and disabled and legislative reform ) .  
With regard to earlier notification of Member States in danger of falling under Article 19 , requested in paragraph 12 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 207 B , the Committee was advised that uncertainty about the amounts and timing of assessments for peacekeeping and the international tribunals precluded accurate calculations for the application of Article 19 much before the end of the previous year .  
In paragraph 12 of the same resolution , the General Assembly requested the Unit to continue to focus its reports on important priority items , identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing the Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues .  
In paragraph 6 , the General Assembly requested JIU to seek a more reader - friendly and uniform format of reports , taking into account new publishing technologies , which would include sections containing the objectives of the report , an executive summary , the conclusions drawn and , as appropriate , the action required to be taken by the organizations , in order to make reports as concise as possible and to comply with the existing page limit of 32 pages .  
Nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the requested State has substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition for an offence set forth in article 2 has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of that person 's race , religion , nationality , ethnic origin or political opinion , or that that person 's position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons .  
While reaffirming our full adherence to the principles of mutual interest and the shared but differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries contained in the Rio Declaration , and to its general implementation , we requested , first , that developed countries honour the commitments undertaken in Rio to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross national product to development assistance .  
In its decision 96 / 25 , the Executive Board decided , inter alia , to introduce an annual work plan and , in paragraph 5 of the same decision , requested that UNDP and UNFPA prepare , for the third regular session " an outline of issues that could be considered by the Board in 1997 , based on previous deliberations of the Board and the organizational priorities and objectives set for 1997 " .

Although the international community seems to be slowly becoming more understanding concerning the need to clarify the fate and whereabouts of missing persons by means of exhuming and identifying mortal remains , and therefore more responsive to the fund raising appeals , there is still an urgent need for considerably greater contributions to finance the comprehensive programme of forensic activities requested by the Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 34 ( a ) of resolution 1996 / 71 .  
The sanitary surveillance secretariat of the Brazilian Ministry of Health , responsible for the control of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , has requested assistance from UNDCP in designing a national programme to identify and rectify its institutional deficiencies .  
Also in its resolution 51 / 59 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to distribute to all States the International Code of Conduct for Public Officials , annexed to that resolution , and to include it in the manual on practical measures against corruption , to be revised and expanded by the Secretary-General pursuant to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 14 , with a view to promoting its use in advisory services , training and other technical assistance activities .  
The Council also requested the Secretary-General to conduct a survey , on the basis of existing international conventions , analysing the extent to which children were protected from becoming victims of illicit international trafficking , taking into account both substantive and procedural aspects of providing such protection , and to compile and analyse the data collected .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .

Recalling further section I.AA of its resolution 50 / 208 of 23 December 1995 , by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the International Civil Service Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III .  A of its twenty-first annual report , [ 6 ] taking into account the views expressed by Member States at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons ,  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States in order to determine the feasibility of establishing appropriate machinery for applying criminal law for the protection of the environment , and to establish and maintain close cooperation with Member States and other bodies active in the field of environmental protection , particularly in the area of technical cooperation and assistance , and to continue gathering information on national environmental criminal law and regional and multinational initiatives .  
In paragraphs 5 to 8 of the resolution , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit plans for sharing the costs of establishing and operating a global networking facility with United Nations specialized agencies and programmes ; to report on requirements for network services ; to propose formulas for cost sharing ; to provide comprehensive information concerning location of telecommunications facilities in Member States ; and to show clearly the costs of telecommunications attributable to peacekeeping operations .

Recalling Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
The Assistance Mission 's mandate has been revised and extended by the Council in subsequent resolutions , most recently in resolution 1029 ( 1995 ) of 12 December 1995 , which extended the Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996 .  In the same resolution , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to reduce the military personnel level to 1,400 , to withdraw the civilian police component and to initiate planning for the complete withdrawal of UNAMIR within a period of six weeks after the expiry of its mandate .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments , and at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the operational requirements that necessitated the increase in troops over the authorized level and was informed that the average troop strength exceeded authorized strength by 166 in May 1996 and by 132 in June 1996 owing to the fact that the repatriation of the former UNCRO engineering battalion had to be postponed to the end of June 1996 , since engineering support was needed to complete the installation of military camps . 
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the proposed requirements of $ 1.1-million for claims and adjustments under budget line 10 , " Supplies and services " , and was informed that the requirements were estimated at the same monthly rate ( $ 91,000 ) as in the initial cost estimates contained in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 and that , as at 2 April 1997 , a total of 78 third-party liability claims amounting to $ 400,000 had been received by UNTAES .  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
In the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of a major conference , the Council was requested to ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
By my letter dated 1 November 1996 ( S / 1996 / 910 ) , I transmitted to your predecessor the letter dated 23 October 1996 in which the Government of Burundi formally proposed that the Security Council set up an international criminal tribunal to punish the crimes of genocide perpetrated in Burundi and requested direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning acts of genocide .  
With regard to the staffing levels requested by the Secretary-General based on a projected increase in the volume and complexity of the work of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Administration and Management , the European Union believed that the anticipated workload was not fully justified and shared the Advisory Committee 's view that a meaningful workload analysis was required .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
In view of the experience gained during the events of August 1996 and the subsequent prolonged state of alert , I have requested the contributors of infantry units to increase their strength by a total of 63 personnel all ranks , bringing UNFICYP 's strength to its authorized level .  28 .  Mr . Han Sung-Joo requested that his appointment as my Special Representative for Cyprus not be extended beyond its expiration in April 1997 .  
In July 1996 , an important joint letter addressed to the staff of IMF and that of UNDP on cooperation between the two organizations was signed by their two executive heads , who called on their members to collaborate more closely on new and ongoing technical assistance , country strategy notes ( when requested by Governments ) and policy framework papers and stressing the need for greater collaboration in post - and near-crisis countries and in countries engaged in programmes involving market-oriented reforms and transition .  
In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
The SBI , at its sixth session requested the secretariat to submit a report on progress achieved in returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) not controlled by the Montreal Protocol and projected emissions by sources and removals by sinks of such gases in the year 2000 by each Annex I Party , on the basis of its national communication ( FCCC / SBI / 1997 / 16 ) .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
The existence within the programme of both normative functions ( funded by the regular budget ) and operational technical cooperation activities ( funded by the Fund of UNDCP ) permits a synergy of action : technical expertise that supports the normative work provides a valuable underpinning for technical cooperation activities , and operational activities provide an important source of experience in putting international norms into practice .  10 .  In its resolution 14 ( XXXVIII ) , the Commission requested the Executive Director to indicate the relationship between mandates and budgetary allocations .  
The international collaborative exercises constitute the first phase of the international quality assurance programme , carried out by UNDCP , in which participating laboratories are requested , twice a year , to analyse unknown samples of seized material and / or biological specimens .  
As requested by the participants , the future parliament would only be composed of democratically elected representatives designated by central African States where free and fair elections are held .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52 / 227 , requested the Secretary-General to take appropriate action to reduce the dependency on the current contractor and to ensure that a comprehensive programme for IMIS training is included as part of the ongoing training programme , and that adequate and qualified staff are assigned to the implementation and operation of the system at all duty stations .  
In its resolution 50 / 233 of 7 June 1996 , the General Assembly requested the Joint Inspection Unit to continue to focus its reports on important priority items , identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing the Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues .  
In its decision 1998 / 102 , the Commission requested the independent expert to submit his report as envisioned in decision 1997 / 103 for consideration by the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights , which is scheduled to meet from 1 to 5 March 1999 . 
With regard to budgetary allocations , the judiciary requested 750-million quetzales for fiscal year 1999 , based largely on the needs involved in the implementation of its modernization plan ; the executive branch assigned it 366.5-million quetzales in the regular budget .  
From the additional information requested by the Committee , it is evident that the reduction to $ 1,884,500 under this budget item , taking into account the decision contained in resolution 51 / 233 regarding the Qana incident , from the initial estimate of $ 2,884,000 , proved to be unrealistic .  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
It will be recalled that the Committee , at its organizational session in May 1998 , requested the Secretary-General to submit to its second substantive session in April 2000 a comprehensive document assessing the overall level of implementation of the outcome of the Summit , including the identification of constraints , obstacles and successes and lessons learned , as well as recommendations on further actions and initiatives at the national and international levels .  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
At the end of his testimony , each man requested that compensation be paid for the consequent material damage and mental suffering , as did all those others who attended the sessions of the Chamber in order to pursue civil claims .  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the working group , in order to continue its work , to meet prior to the fifty _ sixth session of the Commission for a period of two weeks , with a view to completing expeditiously a final and substantive text , and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ sixth session .  
In the same resolution , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stressed that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions .  
To set up a voluntary fund designed to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund ;  
In its resolution , the Sub _ Commission agreed that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should be requested to send out a questionnaire to Governments , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations , inviting them to send all relevant national documentation on the subject of affirmative action .  
The hearing shall be attended by a judicial authority of the requested State , assisted by an interpreter where necessary , who shall also be responsible for ensuring both identification of the individual to be heard and compliance with the fundamental principles of the law of the requested State .  
In its resolution 1998 / 5 , the Sub _ Commission decided , since the subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept and practice of affirmative action , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
Each State Party shall consider implementing measures , in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and local communities , to provide for the physical , psychological and social recovery and , when requested , spiritual assistance of victims of and witnesses to crimes covered by this Protocol , in order to foster their health , self-respect and dignity , as well as their education and employment opportunities , in a manner appropriate to their age , gender and special needs .  
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .  
The Secretary-General was also requested to create a Scientific and Technical Committee , of 20 to 25 experts selected in consultation with their Governments , to develop overall programmes to be taken into account in bilateral and multilateral cooperation for the Decade , paying attention to priorities and gaps in technical knowledge identified at the national levels ( for an assessment of the work of the Committee , see A / 54 / 132 / Add . 1E / 1999 / 80 / Add . 1 ) .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
By section V , paragraph 22 , of its resolution 53 / 221 of 7 April 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments .  
In resolution 53 / 221 , the Secretary-General is requested to implement a transparent promotion policy , augmented by the effective use of a simplified and appropriate performance appraisal system , adequate training and competitive examinations , in order to provide for the recognition of competence and outstanding performance and to facilitate the continuous professional growth of staff at all levels .  
Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
The Group recommends that the study on the feasibility of restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms and light weapons to manufacturers and dealers authorized by States , requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of resolution 53 / 77 E , should be completed in time for it to be considered at the international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , to be convened no later than 2001 .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
The Council requested the OAU secretariat to organize a preparatory conference of continental experts on the matter , prior to the convening of the United Nations international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , and to seek the support of relevant United Nations agencies and other actors concerned , so as to evolve a common approach for Africa .  
The Buenos Aires seminar represented a first initiative undertaken in cooperation with the Department for Disarmament Affairs pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 T , in which the Secretary-General is requested to hold broad-based consultations on illicit trafficking in small arms , taking into account the ongoing work of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms , with all Member States , interested regional and subregional organizations , international agencies and experts .  
These 5 May agreements requested the Secretary-General to determine , through a popular consultation based upon a universal , direct and secret ballot , whether the East Timorese people would accept or reject a proposed special autonomy for East Timor within the unitary Republic of Indonesia .  
It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs and , in this connection , may seek assistance from the international community and UNCTAD in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in regional / subregional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
Providing organizations the opportunity to indicate whether they could absorb the costs of the activities being requested within current and / or successive programmes of work and budget , or whether such activities could only be carried out if additional financing was provided , would avoid the risk of diversion of resources or staff time from the programme of work and budget approved by its governing bodies , while contributing to more consistent and coherent governance by Member States .  
In paragraph 6 of resolution 1999 / 6 , the Commission requested the Secretary _ General to bring that resolution to the attention of all Governments , the competent United Nations organs , the specialized agencies , regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations and to give it the widest possible publicity , and to report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ sixth session .  
Under the terms of operative paragraph 12 , the General Assembly would , inter alia , request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene expert meetings , as requested in previous General Assembly resolutions in the past , to study and update the international legislation in force and to propose recommendations for a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make for more efficient prevention and punishment of mercenary activities .  
In paragraph 7 of resolution 1999 / 26 the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Resources of $ 155,000 are requested for the hiring of international and local consultants with expertise in the fields of judicial administration , penal law and procedure , constitutional law , juvenile law , legal assistance , human rights and civic education programmes .  
In this connection , the Committee recalls paragraph 7 ( c ) of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 , in which it stated that the budget line other staff costs should be broken down by component , that is , into amounts requested for : temporary assistance for meetings ; temporary assistance to cover maternity and extended sick leave ; supplementary staff for peak workloads or unforeseen special requirements ; and overtime .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
In its resolution 1999 / 52 , the Commission decided to re-establish the open-ended inter-sessional ad hoc working group established in accordance with resolution 1998 / 20 to meet for eight working days prior to the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , and requested the working group to submit , with a view to completing its task , one or more concrete proposals on the establishment of a permanent forum for consideration by the Commission at that session .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
At its 417 th meeting , on 23 June , the Committee decided to add to the agenda for its substantive session of 1999 the item entitled Participation of observers , and requested the Secretariat to prepare a conference room paper on the subject that would include information on any formal or informal procedures , practices and experiences of subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly relating to the participation of observers .

In the case of functional commissions with the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the implementation of a major conference , the Council was requested to ensure the coordination of their multi-year programmes , in accordance with the agreed conclusions adopted by the Council at its substantive session of 1995 on the coordinated follow-up of the results of major international conferences .  
By my letter dated 1 November 1996 ( S / 1996 / 910 ) , I transmitted to your predecessor the letter dated 23 October 1996 in which the Government of Burundi formally proposed that the Security Council set up an international criminal tribunal to punish the crimes of genocide perpetrated in Burundi and requested direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning acts of genocide .  
With regard to the staffing levels requested by the Secretary-General based on a projected increase in the volume and complexity of the work of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Administration and Management , the European Union believed that the anticipated workload was not fully justified and shared the Advisory Committee 's view that a meaningful workload analysis was required .  
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
In view of the experience gained during the events of August 1996 and the subsequent prolonged state of alert , I have requested the contributors of infantry units to increase their strength by a total of 63 personnel all ranks , bringing UNFICYP 's strength to its authorized level .  28 .  Mr . Han Sung-Joo requested that his appointment as my Special Representative for Cyprus not be extended beyond its expiration in April 1997 .  
In July 1996 , an important joint letter addressed to the staff of IMF and that of UNDP on cooperation between the two organizations was signed by their two executive heads , who called on their members to collaborate more closely on new and ongoing technical assistance , country strategy notes ( when requested by Governments ) and policy framework papers and stressing the need for greater collaboration in post - and near-crisis countries and in countries engaged in programmes involving market-oriented reforms and transition .  
In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
The SBI , at its sixth session requested the secretariat to submit a report on progress achieved in returning individually or jointly to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases ( GHGs ) not controlled by the Montreal Protocol and projected emissions by sources and removals by sinks of such gases in the year 2000 by each Annex I Party , on the basis of its national communication ( FCCC / SBI / 1997 / 16 ) .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
Stresses that contracts for the purchase of humanitarian supplies submitted in accordance with resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) must be limited to items which appear on the list of supplies annexed to the second distribution plan prepared by the Government of Iraq and approved by the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraph 8 ( a ) ( ii ) of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , or appropriate amendments to the plan must be requested prior to purchasing items not on the annexed list ;  
The existence within the programme of both normative functions ( funded by the regular budget ) and operational technical cooperation activities ( funded by the Fund of UNDCP ) permits a synergy of action : technical expertise that supports the normative work provides a valuable underpinning for technical cooperation activities , and operational activities provide an important source of experience in putting international norms into practice .  10 .  In its resolution 14 ( XXXVIII ) , the Commission requested the Executive Director to indicate the relationship between mandates and budgetary allocations .  
The international collaborative exercises constitute the first phase of the international quality assurance programme , carried out by UNDCP , in which participating laboratories are requested , twice a year , to analyse unknown samples of seized material and / or biological specimens .  
As requested by the participants , the future parliament would only be composed of democratically elected representatives designated by central African States where free and fair elections are held .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52 / 227 , requested the Secretary-General to take appropriate action to reduce the dependency on the current contractor and to ensure that a comprehensive programme for IMIS training is included as part of the ongoing training programme , and that adequate and qualified staff are assigned to the implementation and operation of the system at all duty stations .  
In its resolution 50 / 233 of 7 June 1996 , the General Assembly requested the Joint Inspection Unit to continue to focus its reports on important priority items , identifying concrete managerial , administrative and programming questions aimed at providing the Assembly and other legislative organs of participating organizations with practical and action-oriented recommendations on precisely defined issues .  
In its decision 1998 / 102 , the Commission requested the independent expert to submit his report as envisioned in decision 1997 / 103 for consideration by the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights , which is scheduled to meet from 1 to 5 March 1999 . 
With regard to budgetary allocations , the judiciary requested 750-million quetzales for fiscal year 1999 , based largely on the needs involved in the implementation of its modernization plan ; the executive branch assigned it 366.5-million quetzales in the regular budget .  
From the additional information requested by the Committee , it is evident that the reduction to $ 1,884,500 under this budget item , taking into account the decision contained in resolution 51 / 233 regarding the Qana incident , from the initial estimate of $ 2,884,000 , proved to be unrealistic .  
By a letter dated 24 March 1999 addressed to the President of the Security Council ( S / 1999 / 320 ) , the representative of the Russian Federation requested that an urgent meeting of the Security Council be convened to consider " an extremely dangerous situation caused by the unilateral military action of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia " . 
It will be recalled that the Committee , at its organizational session in May 1998 , requested the Secretary-General to submit to its second substantive session in April 2000 a comprehensive document assessing the overall level of implementation of the outcome of the Summit , including the identification of constraints , obstacles and successes and lessons learned , as well as recommendations on further actions and initiatives at the national and international levels .  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
At the end of his testimony , each man requested that compensation be paid for the consequent material damage and mental suffering , as did all those others who attended the sessions of the Chamber in order to pursue civil claims .  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 53 / 147 of 9 December 1998 in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty _ fifth session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In paragraph 2 of that resolution , the Commission requested the working group , in order to continue its work , to meet prior to the fifty _ sixth session of the Commission for a period of two weeks , with a view to completing expeditiously a final and substantive text , and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ sixth session .  
In the same resolution , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stressed that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions .  
To set up a voluntary fund designed to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund ;  
In its resolution , the Sub _ Commission agreed that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights should be requested to send out a questionnaire to Governments , international organizations and non _ governmental organizations , inviting them to send all relevant national documentation on the subject of affirmative action .  
The hearing shall be attended by a judicial authority of the requested State , assisted by an interpreter where necessary , who shall also be responsible for ensuring both identification of the individual to be heard and compliance with the fundamental principles of the law of the requested State .  
In its resolution 1998 / 5 , the Sub _ Commission decided , since the subject required careful and comprehensive inquiry , to appoint Mr . Bossuyt as Special Rapporteur with the task of preparing a study on the concept and practice of affirmative action , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit a preliminary report to the Sub _ Commission at its fifty _ first session .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 26 , welcomed the provisional report on the relationship between the enjoyment of human rights , in particular economic , social and cultural rights , and income distribution , prepared by the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Jos Bengoa ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1996 / 14 ) , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit his final report to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
The present document is submitted pursuant to Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 , in which the Board requested the Executive Director to report biennially on the appropriateness of the level of the operational reserve of the United Nations Office of Project Services ( UNOPS ) , established in the same decision at 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the previous year .  
Each State Party shall consider implementing measures , in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and local communities , to provide for the physical , psychological and social recovery and , when requested , spiritual assistance of victims of and witnesses to crimes covered by this Protocol , in order to foster their health , self-respect and dignity , as well as their education and employment opportunities , in a manner appropriate to their age , gender and special needs .  
This was undertaken in pursuance of resolution 51 / 39 , in which the Assembly had requested the Secretary-General to update and further develop an earlier report dated 17 October 1990 , entitled Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security ( A / 45 / 568 ) , in order to evaluate the impact of recent scientific and technological developments , in particular those which have potential military applications .  
The Secretary-General was also requested to create a Scientific and Technical Committee , of 20 to 25 experts selected in consultation with their Governments , to develop overall programmes to be taken into account in bilateral and multilateral cooperation for the Decade , paying attention to priorities and gaps in technical knowledge identified at the national levels ( for an assessment of the work of the Committee , see A / 54 / 132 / Add . 1E / 1999 / 80 / Add . 1 ) .  
It is with this in mind that I have requested the floor today to outline some elements South Africa regards as politically achievable and technically feasible in obtaining an effective , credible and workable fissile material treaty that would reinforce the nuclear disarmament and non _ proliferation regime .  
The reasons for the unavailability of interpretation services for meetings of regional and other major groupings vary , but the most frequent cause is the growing overall demand for ad hoc meetings scheduled by other intergovernmental groups , as evidenced by the week of 2226 February when six meetings each were requested by a working group of the International Civil Service Commission and a grouping of Member States on issues related to small island developing States .  
By section V , paragraph 22 , of its resolution 53 / 221 of 7 April 1999 , the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to complete the realignment with the national competitive examination for promotion to the Professional category and above of staff members from other categories , in particular regarding academic qualifications and equitable geographical distribution , as well as equal treatment with regard to probationary appointments .

Additionally , we would like to reiterate our suggestion contained in the previous written submission that the Working Group on Communications at its first meeting would be requested to ensure that 1503 submissions meet the following preconditions : ( a ) domestic remedies have been exhausted ; ( b ) the matter under consideration is demonstrably a gross and reliably attested violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; ( c ) the submissions are clearly devoid of politicization .  
The Group recommends that the study on the feasibility of restricting the manufacture and trade of small arms and light weapons to manufacturers and dealers authorized by States , requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of resolution 53 / 77 E , should be completed in time for it to be considered at the international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , to be convened no later than 2001 .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
In its resolution 1999 / 78 , paragraph 53 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner to set up a voluntary fund designed specifically to cover all aspects of the preparatory process for the World Conference and the participation of non-governmental organizations , especially from developing countries , and requested all Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations and private individuals to contribute to that Fund .  
The Council requested the OAU secretariat to organize a preparatory conference of continental experts on the matter , prior to the convening of the United Nations international conference on the illicit arms trade in all its aspects , and to seek the support of relevant United Nations agencies and other actors concerned , so as to evolve a common approach for Africa .  
The Buenos Aires seminar represented a first initiative undertaken in cooperation with the Department for Disarmament Affairs pursuant to General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 T , in which the Secretary-General is requested to hold broad-based consultations on illicit trafficking in small arms , taking into account the ongoing work of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms , with all Member States , interested regional and subregional organizations , international agencies and experts .  
These 5 May agreements requested the Secretary-General to determine , through a popular consultation based upon a universal , direct and secret ballot , whether the East Timorese people would accept or reject a proposed special autonomy for East Timor within the unitary Republic of Indonesia .  
It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
On that basis , the Secretary-General requested and obtained from the Advisory Committee a commitment authority in an amount not exceeding $ 1,897,300 gross ( $ 1,600,500 net ) to meet the revised phase I requirements of UNAMET for the additional month of September 1999 , pursuant to paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 52 / 223 of 22 December 1997 on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .

Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs and , in this connection , may seek assistance from the international community and UNCTAD in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in regional / subregional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
Providing organizations the opportunity to indicate whether they could absorb the costs of the activities being requested within current and / or successive programmes of work and budget , or whether such activities could only be carried out if additional financing was provided , would avoid the risk of diversion of resources or staff time from the programme of work and budget approved by its governing bodies , while contributing to more consistent and coherent governance by Member States .  
In paragraph 6 of resolution 1999 / 6 , the Commission requested the Secretary _ General to bring that resolution to the attention of all Governments , the competent United Nations organs , the specialized agencies , regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations and to give it the widest possible publicity , and to report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty _ sixth session .  
Under the terms of operative paragraph 12 , the General Assembly would , inter alia , request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene expert meetings , as requested in previous General Assembly resolutions in the past , to study and update the international legislation in force and to propose recommendations for a clearer legal definition of mercenaries that would make for more efficient prevention and punishment of mercenary activities .  
In paragraph 7 of resolution 1999 / 26 the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
Resources of $ 155,000 are requested for the hiring of international and local consultants with expertise in the fields of judicial administration , penal law and procedure , constitutional law , juvenile law , legal assistance , human rights and civic education programmes .  
In this connection , the Committee recalls paragraph 7 ( c ) of its first report on the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 , in which it stated that the budget line other staff costs should be broken down by component , that is , into amounts requested for : temporary assistance for meetings ; temporary assistance to cover maternity and extended sick leave ; supplementary staff for peak workloads or unforeseen special requirements ; and overtime .  
It was to be hoped that the questionnaire would meet with the widest possible response , but Governments might find it difficult to provide all the information requested , as the concept of a unilateral act might be as undefined at the national level as it was at the international level .  
The Commission also requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider the possibility of holding a workshop with the independent expert and the experts from the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in 1999 with a view to consultations also involving the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council on the main elements of a possible draft declaration on human rights and extreme poverty .  
In its resolution 1999 / 52 , the Commission decided to re-establish the open-ended inter-sessional ad hoc working group established in accordance with resolution 1998 / 20 to meet for eight working days prior to the fifty-sixth session of the Commission , and requested the working group to submit , with a view to completing its task , one or more concrete proposals on the establishment of a permanent forum for consideration by the Commission at that session .  
In the Plan of Action adopted at the World Summit all regional institutions , including regional political and economic organizations , were requested to include consideration of the World Declaration and Plan of Action on the agenda of their meetings , including at the highest political level , with a view to developing agreements for mutual collaboration for implementation and ongoing monitoring .  
At its 417 th meeting , on 23 June , the Committee decided to add to the agenda for its substantive session of 1999 the item entitled Participation of observers , and requested the Secretariat to prepare a conference room paper on the subject that would include information on any formal or informal procedures , practices and experiences of subsidiary bodies of the General Assembly relating to the participation of observers .

The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
Does anyone in this Hall believe that they might read on the Internet or in a newspaper in the foreseeable future that a South-East Asian country has requested or received a mandate from the Security Council to intervene , without the consent of the White House , in a civil conflict in Michigan that the White House has been unable to control , a conflict resulting from wild actions of the famous local militias ? 
Detailed information , including the latest statistical data , is also requested on the progressive realization of economic , social and cultural rights in East Jerusalem , keeping in mind the concerns raised by the Committee in the relevant paragraphs of these concluding observations .  
Indeed , at its forty-ninth session in August 1997 , the Sub-Commission adopted resolution 1997-7 in which it requested one of its experts , Mr . Mustapha Mehedi , to prepare a working paper on the right to education with the purpose of explaining the content of the right to education , taking account , in particular , of its social dimension and the freedoms it includes and of its dual civil and political rights and economic , social and cultural character .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 52-227 , requested the Secretary-General to include in his tenth progress report a detailed plan of action and information on the final level of resources needed to resolve all outstanding problems so as to make the system fully operational , taking into account , inter alia , the study by the independent experts .  
In the final paragraph of the text , regret was expressed that a comprehensive review of the issues raised in the three previous resolutions on the item had not been carried out and the Secretary-General was requested to undertake that review and report on its conduct and on the implementation of the current resolution addressing a range of structural and management issues , including those raised by the Advisory Committee . 
In its resolution 1998-24 , the Commission on Human Rights decided to appoint for a three-year period a special rapporteur on the effects of foreign debt on the full enjoyment of economic , social and cultural rights , and requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to the Commission on an annual basis , beginning at its fifty-fifth session , an analytical report on the implementation of the resolution .  
Generally speaking , these approaches and ideas have been put forward in the various countries in which UNIAPRAVIs ideas have become established.They have been disseminated through three main channels : firstly , through international meetings organized , promoted or attended by UNIAPRAVI ; secondly , through documents and publications prepared by UNIAPRAVI ; and , thirdly , through the provision of technical assistance and advice requested by members .  
89 . At its fifty-fourth session , in resolution 1998-34 , the Commission requested the open-ended working group , in order to continue its work , to meet prior to the fifty-fifth session of the Commission for a period of two weeks , in the course of which the Chairman of the working group , in consultation with the members of the group , might request one additional week with a view to completing expeditiously a final and substantive text , and to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-75 , recognizing the urgent need for the adoption of effective measures , nationally , regionally and internationally , to protect the civilian population , especially women and children , in northern Uganda from the effects of armed conflict , requested the Secretary _ General to report on the implementation of that resolution to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
In its resolution 1998 59 , the Commission requested the independent expert to report to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session , in particular on the basis of a detailed assessment of the means necessary to establish a programme of advisory services and technical cooperation through , inter alia , the contribution of agencies and programmes of the United Nations in the field , as well as of the non _ governmental sector .  
In its report dated 10 October 1997 ( A 52-451 ) , the Advisory Committee , taking into account the preliminary unencumbered balance from the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 of some $ 2.5-million gross and the additional amount of $ 3 , 273 , 800 gross ( $ 3 , 233 , 000 net ) committed for the electoral process , indicated that there was no need at that time for the additional assessment requested by the Secretary-General ( see para . 6 above ) .  
The Committee called upon States parties to ensure that the mandates accorded to all national human rights institutions include appropriate attention to economic , social and cultural rights and requested States parties to include details both on the mandates and the major relevant activities of such institutions in their reports to the Committee .

The Chairperson-Rapporteur proposed a revised work programme which would not include a time-frame for informal governmental meetings , but would allow for the plenary to be suspended if requested by the participants , whether governmental or indigenous representatives , and when the chairperson considered it useful and a contribution to the process .  
A total of 104 Local level staff are requested to provide clerical , administrative and technical support for the smooth running of transport operations .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
The Sub-Commission , noting that actual or potential conflicts exist between the implementation of the TRIPS Agreement and the realization of economic , social and cultural rights in relation to access to patented pharmaceuticals and the implications for the enjoyment of the right to health , requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake an analysis of the human rights impacts of the TRIPS Agreement .  
In its resolution 2000 / 64 , the Commission on Human Rights requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite all States to provide practical examples of activities that have been effective in strengthening good governance practices for the promotion of human rights at the national level , including activities in the context of development cooperation between States , for inclusion in a compilation of indicative ideas and practices that could be consulted by the interested States when required .  
It had expressed regret , however , that full information on the preliminary estimate of resources was not available in the proposed budget outline , despite the fact that in its resolution 53 / 206 , the General Assembly had requested that provisions should be made in the budget outline for expenditures for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved in the course of the biennium .  
This report responds to relevant decisions taken by the Executive Board on the reports of the Executive Director to the Economic and Social Council over the past several years , in particular decision 1999 / 6 ( E / ICEF / 1999 / 7 / Rev . 1 ) , which requested the Executive Director to ensure that future reports to the Council advance the Boards wish for greater analytical effort , selected focus on key issues , problem-oriented reporting and discussions of lessons learned .  
She also requested additional information on the nature of the regional thematic round tables , which were to be held in conjunction with selected interactive thematic sessions .  
The representative of Ukraine requested that the report of the Ad Hoc Committee reflect his view that the travaux prparatoires should indicate that the words state-to-state transactions and state transfers were included in article 4 , paragraph 2 , on the understanding that they included state-to-state transactions involving firearms and state transfers of firearms effected on the basis of relevant agreements concluded between the Governments of the States concerned or on behalf of those Governments by virtue of powers conferred by them .  
In addition , the attention of the Committee is drawn to General Assembly resolution 55 / 186 of , entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity , in paragraph 25 of which the Assembly requested that the resolution be made available to the Committee as an input to its work on the systemic issues contained in its preliminary substantive agenda . 
Consequently , the Council , in its resolution 724 ( XXVIII ) of 17 July 1959 , requested the Secretary-General to inform the IAEA of its desire that the IAEA be entrusted with the drafting of recommendations on the transport of radioactive material , on the understanding that these recommendations would be consistent with the principles adopted by the Committee and that they would be established in consultation with the United Nations and the specialized agencies concerned .  
Reiterates its requests that the relevant special rapporteurs and the special mechanisms of the Commission undertake missions to the Republic of Chechnya of the Russian Federation without delay and expresses serious concern that the thematic special rapporteurs or representatives on the question of torture , on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and on internally displaced persons , who have requested to undertake visits have not yet received an answer and urges the Government of the Russian Federation to give favourable consideration to their requests as a matter of priority ;  
Mindful of General Assembly resolutions on the subject of extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions , of which the latest is resolution 55 / 111 of 4 December 2000 , in which the Assembly requested the Special Rapporteur to submit to it at its fifty-seventh session an interim report on the situation worldwide in regard to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions and her recommendations for more effective action to combat that phenomenon ,  
It also decided to limit requests for written information to statistical data ; information requested in the Committees reporting guidelines , but missing from the report ; points of clarification regarding the report ; and information on key legal , structural , policy or institutional issues or new developments .  
Whereas it is important that initial reports are comprehensive , providing a detailed account of the national legal , administrative and practical system of implementation of the Covenant as requested in the guidelines , it is questionable whether it is useful for the Committee to ask States parties to repeat such information in their periodic reports .  
In future , it will limit requests for written information to statistical data , information requested in the guidelines but missing in the report points of clarification regarding the report , and information on key legal , structural , policy and institutional issues ( for the initial report ) or new developments ( with regard to periodic reports ) .
