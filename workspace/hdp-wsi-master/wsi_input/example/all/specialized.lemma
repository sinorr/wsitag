Urges all Governments , competent regional economic integration organizations and the executive heads of the competent specialized agencies and of other organizations and programmes of the United Nations system to continue to present their views to the Secretary-General on institutional developments related to the strengthening of international organizations in the area of multilateral trade ;  
Also requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Trust and Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;

Taking note of Economic and Social Council decision 1992 / 255 of 20 July 1992 , in which the Council requested United Nations bodies and specialized agencies to ensure that all technical assistance financed or provided by them was compatible with international instruments and standards applicable to indigenous people , and encouraged efforts to promote coordination in this field and greater participation of indigenous people in the planning and implementation of projects affecting them ,  
Recommends for this purpose that a second technical meeting on the planning of the Decade be convened immediately prior to the thirteenth session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations , to be supported from within existing budgetary resources , and urges Governments , United Nations bodies , specialized agencies and , in particular , indigenous people 's organizations to participate actively in that meeting , in accordance with agreed procedures ;  
Decides to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ;  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in Professional posts , especially at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and submitting more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , specialized agencies and regional commissions ;  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Strongly encourages Member States to support the strategic plan and the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to increase the percentage of women in the Professional category , especially in posts at the D-1 level and above , by identifying and sending forward more women candidates , encouraging women to apply for vacant posts and creating national rosters of women candidates to be shared with the Secretariat , the specialized agencies and the regional commissions ;  
Noting the assistance extended thus far to colonial Territories by certain specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , and considering that such assistance should be expanded further , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for external assistance ,  
Urges the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , in cooperation with the regional and other organizations where appropriate , to submit to their governing and legislative organs concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant United Nations decisions , particularly specific programmes of assistance to the peoples of the colonial Territories and their national liberation movements ;  
A provision of $ 58,100 would be required to hire consultants ( $ 24,700 ) to provide specialized inputs for documents related to regional repercussions of bilateral or multilateral free trade agreements , taking into account the evolution of environmental policies and changing production patterns in the housing and urban infrastructure construction sector , including proposals for its modernization , and ( $ 33,400 ) for the convening of three ad hoc expert group meetings .  
The resource growth is attributable to ( a ) acquisition of the specialized automation equipment required for development of local area network in the Department under the responsibility of the Information Support Unit ( $ 55,000 ) , and ( b ) additional requirements for replacement of existing equipment of the Department under the global programme of technological innovations ( $ 113,900 ) .

For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
Smaller specialized agencies such as the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and organizations such as the ILO International Training Centre have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with the development of policy and technical options in highly focused subsectoral issues and that assistance should remain flexible to meet needs in specific areas .  
National participating organizations would be expected to constitute teams of qualified volunteers ( perhaps focusing on a limited number of areas of coverage identified by each organization ) , assure their specialized training and facilitate the rapid deployment and integration of such teams , including the building of linkages with local non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations in the receiving countries .  
Their upper echelons are generally composed of professionals ( such as physicians and educators ) who , outside of their field , do not have the specialized training needed to handle managerial activities in the characteristic environment of social programmes ( uncertainty , conflict , scarce resources , pressures from all sides and constant negotiations ) ;  
It is possible clearly to visualize the possibility of identifying , within a social network , joint projects in such critical areas as , for example , the production of strategic information , the cooperative search for financing sources and collective negotiation of financing , the training of specialized human resources and the setting of quality standards in the evaluation of social programmes .  
The real challenge in the area of reforming the social sector is to transcend the current limitations of its organizations , which are isolated , inflexible , overly centralized , hostile to genuine participation , unwilling to address the problems created by power struggles , reluctant to cooperate , of insufficient importance in the State apparatus and lacking in professional career paths for managers and in managers with specialized training in the social sphere .  
Requests the specialized agencies and the international institutions associated with the United Nations , as well as regional organizations , to strengthen existing measures of support and formulate appropriate programmes of assistance to the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , within the framework of their respective mandates , in order to accelerate progress in the economic and social sectors of those Territories ;

Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
The Organization also stated that its activities directly addressed , inter alia , such issues raised in the programme for the third term of the Decade as the problem of ILO Conventions that had not achieved wide ratification , institutional means of action regarding the implementation of international labour standards , the ILO programme of work relevant to the progressive development of such standards and future trends in this regard in ILO 's specialized field .  
Smaller specialized agencies have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with highly focused subsectoral issues and that operational activities should remain flexible to meet requirements in these specific technical areas .  
Smaller specialized agencies such as the International Maritime Organization ( IMO ) and the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) and organizations such as the International Trade Centre ( ITC ) have pointed out that the programme approach tends to focus on broad thematic issues while they are more concerned with the development of policy and technical options in highly focused subsectoral issues and that assistance should remain flexible to meet needs in specific areas .  
The activities executed at the regional level by the UNESCO Principal Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific ( PROAP ) at Bangkok serve 40 member States . 4 / The national commissions of UNESCO in the member States themselves form a network of cooperation which is further supported by a number of networks of specialized educational institutions and several thousand key educators in Asia and the Pacific participating in South-South cooperation through a number of mechanisms .

In the absence of specialized theoretical and practical knowledge , and in view of the difficulties faced in obtaining such knowledge , as well as the results of the experience accumulated in other countries , the elaboration of strategies and their implementation through legislative and regulatory measures are daunting tasks for many countries , particularly developing countries and those with economies in transition .  
NULLAlthough special programmes and specialized financial institutions are important , their limited coverage means that a sustained impact on the problem of underfunding of micro-enterprises and SMEs calls for more active involvement of commercial banks , which tend to exclude this portion of the population because of the conviction that it is too costly to service .  
Support is provided by United Nations specialized agencies to each of these programmes , in which satellite observation and electronic communications systems are employed along with conventional national and regional telecommunications systems for the interpretation and dissemination of early-warning information for participating countries .  
NULLUNFPA is continuing to play a catalytic role in assisting the member States of OIC to develop common projects using the technical cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC ) model of cooperation and strengthening its collaboration with regional institutions and the specialized institutions of OIC in areas of mutual interest .  
It also welcomed the call in the Plan of Action for more systematic coordination among specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions and NGOs , and the assignment of that responsibility to the High Commissioner ; coordinated international action in the area of human rights education would result in more effective assistance to individual countries without weakening their sense of " ownership " of curricula reforms .  
While increasing the number of African States participating in the stand-by arrangements is an ongoing process in the short and medium term , I invite those African States that are already participating to cooperate with the Stand-by Arrangements Management Team to compile a complete picture , by the spring of 1996 , of specialized and heavy equipment needs .  
Initially , i.e . , before the establishment of ICSC 20 years ago , these relationship agreements tying the specialized agencies to the United Nations through adherence to " a single unified international civil service " ( later termed " United Nations common system " ) were intended to be between equals .  
Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;

The United States of America , continuing to ignore the views of specialized agencies and the readiness of Cuba to establish a serious exchange of information on the basis of the principle of sovereign equality of States and mutual respect , had not halted its illegal television and radio broadcasts directed against Cuba , openly violating the most basic norms of coexistence and international law .  
Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to strengthen cooperation and coordination between the United Nations and other organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and the League of Arab States and its specialized organizations in order to enhance their capacity to serve the mutual interests of the two organizations in the political , economic , social , humanitarian , cultural and administrative fields ;

Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,  
Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination , in April 1994 , the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs , bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights , as set out in resolution 48 / 141 ,

To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
The programme , under the responsibility of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) , focuses its analytical work on designing public policies and facilitates the implementation of such policies , concentrating operational services in the areas of specialized information , advisory assistance , training and support for regional and international cooperation .  
Among them were the following : their removed location from sources of information and special components ; the relatively low number of specialized training centres resulting in more expensive in-house and foreign training requirements ; the lack of qualified suppliers , which resulted in more expensive in-house process development ; and a less efficient country infrastructure .  
In terms of the poor penetration of agricultural areas that required specialized types of services , the Working Group stated that opportunities existed to provide alternative services such as radio communication systems , space or ground based .

The strategic reform of UNIDO , endorsed by member States at the General Conference of UNIDO in December 1995 , has emphasized UNIDO 's dual role as a worldwide forum for supporting and promoting industrial development , and a provider of specialized integrated technical cooperation services .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
Information had been gathered from authorities , victims ' families and non-governmental organizations , from investigations done by specialized agencies and the press , and by reviewing judicial documentation and ascertaining the open and public existence of organizations devoted to the recruitment of soldiers of fortune , that is , persons of military rank or persuasion disposed to serve as mercenaries .

First , with respect to educational and vocational training measures , the Act provides that " education and re-education shall , as far as is possible , take place in ordinary educational establishments , or , failing that , in specialized establishments " ( art . 10 ) ; and lays down the general rule that " vocational training of the disabled must give them the capacity to exercise an economic activity enabling them to use their vocational skills and aptitudes " ( art .  11 ) .  
In addition , while the State attends to the legal framework , the training of specialized personnel , the enhancement of public awareness , and the mobilization of most of the financial resources ( through the Special Fund for the Disabled created in 1988 ) , the associative sector plays a leading role in specialized education , occupational training and rehabilitation for disabled persons who can not attend a normal institution .  
In the current circumstances of technical cooperation , when the demand for traditional longer-term expert assignments is decreasing while rapid-response short-term specialized consultancies are preferred , the Department is of the view that recruitment practices should not be excessively rigid .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .  
Turning to the report of the Secretary-General on privileges and immunities of officials of the United Nations and the specialized agencies and related organizations ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 3 ) he said that the important , sensitive and sometimes difficult task of maintaining the personal safety and security of the staff of the United Nations system was fully recognized by the European Union which appreciated that many of the operations in which staff were expected to serve were complicated and dangerous .  
It was in its endeavour to take up the challenge of providing these people with their basic minimum energy needs that the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) , in a broad-based partnership with the United Nations and its specialized agencies , international organizations and concerned governmental and non-governmental organizations , launched in 1993 a global initiative : a three-year-long communication process known as the World Solar Summit Process .

The oversight role of the General Assembly , as stressed in resolution 49 / 28 , may be expected to assume yet greater significance with universal acceptance of the Convention and be further consolidated by the addition of the new law of the sea institutions to the wider group of international organizations responsible in various specialized aspects of ocean affairs , whose competence therein is affirmed and further reinforced by the Convention . 
It expressly recognizes , and indeed mandates , the need for further elaboration of international rules , standards and recommended practices and procedures for marine environmental protection at the global and regional levels , but at the same time ensures that these more specialized processes are guided by its basic structure .

Mindful of the need for continued and closer cooperation between the United Nations and its specialized agencies and the Organization of African Unity , in particular in the political , economic , social , technical , cultural and administrative fields ,

BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .

The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity from the most critical phase in our independent development is , to a large extent , to the credit of the United Nations and its specialized agencies , which provided Georgia not only with moral support but with specific and timely financial and technical assistance . 
Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
In order to gather specific information on preparations for the Year , United Nations Member States , United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , and selected non-governmental organizations were requested to provide information on the establishment of focal points for the Year and designate priorities for their preparatory activities within the four dimensions of the conceptual framework for the Year .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
The Office 's special programmes and projects shall consist of specialized activities concerning , inter alia , displaced persons , the rights of women , the rights of children and adolescents , the penal and prison systems , indigenous communities , disabled persons and other sectors in need of special protection .  22 .

An important activity , necessitated by the urgency with which accurate information is often requested at the United Nations / specialized agencies desk and the lack of comprehensive tools that would readily provide that information , is the creation of basic ready reference tools ( files , lists and the like ) to meet recurrent queries .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .

Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
Such women benefited from a number of special measures , such as the provision of safe shelter ; counselling by professional social workers ; the possibility of requesting that the administrative procedures in their case should be carried out by a female official of the Ministry of Justice and that a female interpreter should be provided ; language courses scheduled so as to be compatible with family life ; and specialized services for women refugees who obtained residence permits .  
Encourages Governments and intergovernmental organizations to coordinate regional and international cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the specialized agencies and relevant international and regional organizations , research institutions and non _ governmental organizations on the issues related to mountain regions , including the manageability and interaction of mountains and the economy , the impact of mountains on the socio _ economic development of countries , the sustainable human development and the like ;

Recommends that the executive heads of the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system formulate , with the active cooperation of the regional organizations concerned , concrete proposals for the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations and submit the proposals to their governing and legislative organs ;  
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .

In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
We hope that the OSCE mission in Bosnia will continue to work in close contact with relevant United Nations structures and specialized agencies in resolving such vital matters as protection of the rights of ethnic minorities , the problems of refugees , and the normal functioning of municipal authorities .  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;

Its President 's statement to the Special Rapporteur , the documentation he turned over and his account of the company 's background in the countries where it has concluded specialized service contracts offer an alternate way of looking at things in which military sciences are likely to be taken out of the State context and to move into the private sector where they offer skilled professional services in a free and global market .

While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .

The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
Such support mainly involves the assignment of specialized staff to carry out preparatory tasks in a variety of areas , ranging from substantive issues to matters relating to the development of a working methodology and procedures , the preparation of a chronology for the period covered by the Commission 's work , and administrative and logistical matters , which include everything from the recruitment of support staff selected by the members of the Commission to the renting and refurbishing of office space .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system , as well as international and regional organizations , should therefore be invited to examine and review conditions in each of the Territories , commensurate with the pressing needs of the peoples concerned for increased transfer of resources , technology and know-how , and take appropriate measures to accelerate economic and social progress .  
We are encountering many complexities in these conditions , and these require radical organizational and institutional restructuring , vast resources and the relevant modern technologies and specialized technical know-how .

We also wish to stress the need for a highly developed international surveillance , verification and safety system , to be implemented by a specialized body associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and applying the safeguards of the European Atomic Energy Community ( EURATOM ) , following the declaration of all stocks of fissile materials in the facilities of nuclear-weapon States and States with advanced nuclear programmes with a view to determining the fate of fissile materials stemming from the dismantling of nuclear weapons and nuclear explosive devices or as yet unused materials .

Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
It recommended that analytical and conceptual work be carried out both at the specialized level ( e.g . , through continued efforts for developing methodologies and criteria for impact assessment ) and on an interdisciplinary scale ( i.e . , interrelationship between the political , legal , economic and social dimensions of the problem ) .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .

We are all aware that it is not easy to combine differing viewpoints in a single package , but when we recall the current nuclear arms race and the massive stockpiles of nuclear arsenals with all the dangers that they entail , this should induce us to appeal to the international forums specialized in the field of disarmament to place this issue on their list of priorities and to apply its criteria thereto in a comprehensive manner and without any exception .  
UNESCO played a vital role in the round tables of the specialized agencies on communication for development , which constituted an informal mechanism for consultation , the sharing of ideas and experience and the organization of joint action .  
The specialized agencies should seek innovative ways of communicating ideas that reinforced democratic processes and spurred development initiatives ; utilizing communication networks , particularly radio and electronic networks , to increase public access to information and facilitate free and fair participation in decision-making processes ; and enhancing participation by people at the grass roots level , who were the hardest hit by poverty .  
Nevertheless , it is evident that the long-term future of the Base will depend not only on the future level of peacekeeping operations ( new , ongoing and liquidating missions ) , but also on the extent to which the Base can be used to manage other assets of the United Nations , the specialized agencies , funds and programmes , as well as the extent to which its potential for training and communications services is increased .

Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .

In the current circumstances of technical cooperation , when the demand for traditional longer-term expert assignments is decreasing while rapid-response short-term specialized consultancies are preferred , the Department is of the view that recruitment practices should not be excessively rigid .  
It is recommended that the programme of fellowships offered by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights and certain specialized agencies to train indigenous people wishing to gain experience relevant to indigenous issues should be expanded ; and also that community-based training and educational programmes on human rights and indigenous rights should be set up , and training and technical assistance courses in project design and management should be developed .

BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including , inter alia , macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .

Recalling further its resolution 49 / 53 of 9 December 1994 , in which it decided to establish an ad hoc committee , open to all States Members of the United Nations or members of specialized agencies , to review the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission and , in the light of that review , to consider arrangements for the convening of an international conference of plenipotentiaries ,  
In order to gather specific information on preparations for the Year , United Nations Member States , United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , and selected non-governmental organizations were requested to provide information on the establishment of focal points for the Year and designate priorities for their preparatory activities within the four dimensions of the conceptual framework for the Year .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .

An important activity , necessitated by the urgency with which accurate information is often requested at the United Nations / specialized agencies desk and the lack of comprehensive tools that would readily provide that information , is the creation of basic ready reference tools ( files , lists and the like ) to meet recurrent queries .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .

Application of telemedecine was seen by experts as a promising way of addressing issues such as equity , cost containment , optimizing the use expensive technology and specialized medical services , upgrading of health treatment , improving access of patients in remote areas to primary and specialized health services , and regional sharing of knowledge and cooperation .  
Such women benefited from a number of special measures , such as the provision of safe shelter ; counselling by professional social workers ; the possibility of requesting that the administrative procedures in their case should be carried out by a female official of the Ministry of Justice and that a female interpreter should be provided ; language courses scheduled so as to be compatible with family life ; and specialized services for women refugees who obtained residence permits .  
Encourages Governments and intergovernmental organizations to coordinate regional and international cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the specialized agencies and relevant international and regional organizations , research institutions and non _ governmental organizations on the issues related to mountain regions , including the manageability and interaction of mountains and the economy , the impact of mountains on the socio _ economic development of countries , the sustainable human development and the like ;

Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
The United Nations , in cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions , other bodies of the United Nations system , including its specialized agencies , and the World Trade Organization , has a key role in fostering greater coherence , complementarity and coordination in economic policy-making at the global level , including macroeconomic policy issues , and in ensuring the principles of transparency and effective participation and representation , as well as the effective implementation of internationally agreed policies and goals .

Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Encourages voluntary national and regional actions aimed at making available to the United Nations system , through the United Nations Volunteers , national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets on a standby basis , in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices , in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation ;

Paragraph 22.2 should read : " The programme aims at a major strengthening of coordination for human rights throughout the United Nations system leading to a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights based on the contributions of each of the United Nations organs , bodies and specialized agencies whose activities deal with the human rights and on improved inter-agency cooperation and coordination .

In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
We hope that the OSCE mission in Bosnia will continue to work in close contact with relevant United Nations structures and specialized agencies in resolving such vital matters as protection of the rights of ethnic minorities , the problems of refugees , and the normal functioning of municipal authorities .  
Declares , therefore , that ECLAC should function as a centre of excellence charged with collaborating with member States in a comprehensive analysis of development processes geared to the design , monitoring and evaluation of public policies and the resulting provision of operational services in the fields of specialized information , advisory services , training and support for regional and international cooperation and coordination ;

Workshop / Seminars : These activities can be held before or during the UNISPACE III Conference and could be organized by interested specialized agencies of the United Nations and other international organizations on topics consistent with the objectives of the UNISPACE III Conference that would fit within the agreed structure and that would be relevant to their expertise and mandate .

While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
The development of " a concrete proposal for an effective international mechanism on early warning , to include the transfer of technologies related to early warning to developing countries " requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 5 of its resolution 50 / 117 B of 20 December 1995 , is just one specialized form of the comprehensive information management responsibility assigned to the Decade secretariat .

To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .
