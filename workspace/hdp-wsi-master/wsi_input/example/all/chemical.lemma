Last year alone , the Bank of China provided an accumulated total of more than 69 billion yuan of RMB loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  In addition , the bank also issued more than 4-billion US dollars in the form of foreign exchange rate and spot exchange rate loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  These loans were mainly to support the basic raw materials , chemical , and mechanical industries , etc .  
Having gone through the deficit phase incurred by the whole industry in the last half year , China 's chemical industry completed an annual gross industrial output value of 278-billion yuan , with a growth rate of 8% , and continuing to maintain steady growth .  
The detachment also made use of the technological advantages of colleges , and launched several special firing experiments under the guidance of college experts , including antitank missile cross-water firing , pitch angle firing , and firing in nuclear and chemical warfare .  They obtained a huge amount of first-hand information , and accumulated precious experiences .  Based on their training results , they compiled the " training outlines , " which were promulgated and implemented by the whole army .  
It is known that major Indian exports to China are aquatic products , iron sand , and cotton yarn , while major imports from China are organic chemical products , electronic products , coal , and cotton thread .  The volume of bilateral trade between China and India for 1999 totaled about $ 2-billion .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
They tried 290 cases of selling food below sanitary standards or poisonous harmful food , products below safety standards , counterfeit medicine , as well as counterfeit and bad quality agricultural chemicals , animal medicine , chemical fertilizers , and seeds , an increase of 24 percent over the previous year , involving the punishment of 267 criminals .  
The United States , mouthing human rights , in the end utilized concentrated bombing and depleted uranium bombs - - weapons prohibited by international law , and bombed residential sites , schools , hospital , and other civilian targets , even flagrantly bombing chemical installations , causing the spread of chemicals and reagents , seemingly carrying out chemical warfare .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
It has set up a number of specialized laboratories for nuclear and chemical protection research and experiments .  It has a high-level contingent of scientists and researchers .  Over the years , it has attained a number of scientific research achievements that are up to advanced world standards in the field of nuclear and chemical protection .  
At that time our country 's capacity for screening chemical compounds was less than one-tenth of that of a single US research institute .  Despite the circumstances , members of the project group were determined to carry out innovative research .  Eventually they triumphed over their powerful adversaries , smashed the preoccupation that " developing countries are unable to develop new drugs " and captured the world 's commanding height of developing the anti-malaria drug .  
Located in border and coastal areas , Dandong city has many chemical plants .  To step up preparations for military struggles and prevent sudden environmental pollution incidents , the Dandong city government and the army units stationed there gathered materials relevant to the urban unclear and chemical plants attacked during the Gulf War and Kosovo War and drew up a meticulous and thorough emergency plan .  
Bearing in mind Dandong 's key antichemical warfare work targets , the antichemical warfare detachment of the local troops conducted the exploratory drill to counter possible direct or indirect use of chemical weapons by the enemy in future warfare .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
Pilotless combat planes can complete various missions without the limitations set by the human body , such as approaching close to forward positions , carrying ground tracking sensors , synthetic aperture radar sensors , moving target indicators , and so on , or else doing on-the-spot monitoring of chemical and biological substances .  
The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
We will selectively support a group of backbone enterprises in the energy , metallurgy , chemical , light , textile , machinery , automobile , building materials , and construction industries in their efforts to carry out technical transformation and improve the standards of their technology and equipment while working around the goals of increasing product varieties , improving quality , conserving energy , preventing and controlling pollution , expanding exports , and improving labor productivity .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
These officials believe that the new US administration has two " nails in the eye and thorns in the flesh " : The first is what Americans say is Iraq 's concealed underground biological and chemical weapons stores , and the second is the nuclear command centers which , they say , Russia is hurrying to build , hidden deep in the mountains .  
Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
Yuanfang of the Yadong Group which has been investing in the mainland 's upstream chemical fiber and downstream garment industries in recent years made profits across the board last year .  Yuandong Industry 's ( Shanghai ) after-tax profit topped NT $ 890-million , and this year it will vigorously pursue vertical integration to set up an entire production line of spinning , weaving , and dyeing and will invest another $ 50-million , equivalent to NT $ 1.7-billion .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
The nation 's discharge of sulfur dioxide , chemical oxygen demand , dust , industrial solid waste and other major pollutants should be cut by 10 percent relative to 2000 ' s level .  In particular , the emission of sulfur dioxide in the " two controlled " zones should be reduced by 20 percent compared to 2000 ' s levels .  
After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .

the manufacturing industrial departments with a medium ( less than 50 percent ) effective protection rate include paper , petroleum , chemical industry , basic chemical products , chemical fiber , rubber , plastics , nonmetallic minerals , ferroalloy processing , and nonmetal processing industry ;  
They said they started the war to keep stable the Yugoslav Federation 's situation and to halt military conflicts and disputes , namely , with good intentions , but what followed was : The people were plunged into misery and suffering , the national economy fell back 20 years , and the natural environment and people 's lives were threatened by prolonged pollution from nuclear radiation and chemical and poisonous gases We can not help asking : Can a war solve any problem ? 
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is mutually beneficial .  Japan 's yen loans to China and its official development aid have played and will continue to play an important role in China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization ; the attitude of the Japanese Government on the historical problem is generally speaking continuing to make progress , and Japan is now taking a more responsible attitude in handling the problems of chemical weapons left behind in China .  
After the readjustment , the average tariffs for major products will be as follows : 3 percent for mineral products , 7.4 percent for metals , 10.6 percent for chemical products , 12.3 percent for forestry products , 14.3 percent for mechanical and electrical products and instruments , 14.8 percent for light industry products , 17.8 percent for building materials , 19 percent for farm produce , 21.1 percent for textile products , and 24 percent for transportation vehicles .  
The CWC is an important international disarmament treaty against proliferation .  It aims at the comprehensive ban and complete destruction of weapons of mass destruction .  Accordingly , the Convention seeks to exercise control and monitoring over the destruction of chemical weapons and civilian industrial enterprises producing relevant chemicals through the mandatory declaration of data and on-site inspections .  
The Statistics Department pointed out that , during the period from 1994 to 1998 , our country purchased $ 13.3 billion , or 11.9 percent , of regular weapons ( excluding controlled nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , and biochemical weapons ) sold around the world , making our country the world 's largest weapon importing country .  The major countries where Taiwan purchased its weapons from were : The United States , $ 8.1 billion ; and France , $ 5.15 billion .  
and the industrial and commercial and technical supervisory departments must strengthen management of the markets for seed , chemical fertilizer , and pesticides , crack down on counterfeit and inferior goods , and prevent cheating of the peasants .  
enhance the overall quality and competitiveness of industry ; speed up the development of such pillar industries as electronics and information , hydropower , machinery and metallurgy , medicine and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs ; and strive to build up eight major industrial bases for electronics and information , hydropower , heavy machinery and equipment , special steel products , new vanadium-titanium materials , modern Chinese medicine , natural gas and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
On the other hand , output of other industry groups registered year-on-year increases in the fourth quarter of 1997 .  They included the textiles ( including knitting ) industry ( + 5.5% ) , paper products and printing industry ( + 4.0% ) , chemical , rubber , plastic and non-metallic mineral products industry ( + 1.9% ) and miscellaneous manufacturing industries ( + 6.9% ) .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
The Water Supplies Department ( WSD ) conducts physical , chemical , radiological and bacteriological tests on treated water .  More than 100 tests are carried out , including general tests , tests on heavy metal , organic and inorganic compounds , and those listed under the 1993 Guidelines of the WHO .  
" The working group will continue to take a more pro-active role in controlling flytipping , through extension of opening hours for public filling areas and public barging points and giving farmers instructions on how to dispose of animal carcasses . "  " Other controlling measures include strengthening legislation on trip-ticket system for disposal of construction and demolition material , and circulating guidelines to assist the staff of its member departments in the clearance of illegal dumping of chemical waste materials , " he added .  
A Government spokesman said today ( Monday ) that the Dutiable Commodities ( Amendment ) Bill 1999 ( " the Bill " ) would be introduced to address two major practical difficulties encountered by C &amp; amp ; ED in taking prosecution action under such prohibitive provisions .  One lies in proving the supply of certain illicit fuel , while the other relates to proving the use of detreated oil ( oil with its chemical marker illegally removed ) or dutiable light diesel oil as fuel by vehicles .  
As for other industries , notable decreases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the professional and optical equipment industry ( by about $ 1.3 billion or 39% to $ 2.1 billion ) ; the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by about $ 0.1 billion or 9% to $ 1.4 billion ) ; and the plastic products industry ( by about $ 0.1 billion or 20% to $ 0.6 billion ) .  
Analysed by industry group , significant decreases in output were identified in the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( - 20.9% ) and the chemical , rubber , plastic and non-metallic mineral products industry ( - 14.9% ) when compared with a year earlier , while output of the paper products and printing industry showed a marginal decrease of 0.6% .

On the other hand , output of the chemical , rubber , plastic and non-metallic mineral products industry decreased by 13.2% , and that of the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry by 11.4% .  
The review endorsed the basic features of the current TES scheme , including the use of volume and strength of effluent discharged as the technical basis of charging , determination of the volume of effluent discharged from the volume of fresh water supplied , the use of chemical oxygen demand as the parameter for the strength of effluent , and the application of generic values for effluent strength to all trades .  
According to the information released , the EU decided to temporarily suspend the import of all Mainland China 's products of animal origin intended for human consumption or for use in animal feed with effect from 30 January 2002 .  This decision was made in the light of an inspection report on the control of chemical residues in live animals and animal products in the Mainland compiled by the EU 's Food and Veterinary Office . The main products being suspended include honey , rabbit meat , poultry and crustacean food such as shrimps and prawns .  
( c ) We have always encouraged the environmental industry to recover and recycle different kinds of materials .  Hence , the CWTC and some private chemical waste disposal facilities have been recycling chemical waste .  Examples include the recovery of copper oxide from spent etchant ; fuel from oily water waste ; production of lubricating oil , hydraulic oil and moulding oil from different types of recycled waste oil ; silver from photofinishing waste ; and precious metals such as gold and silver from spent plating solution .  
A joint venture of six private chemical firms , the plant was completed in May 1973 , with a total capitalization of NT $ 320 million ( US $ 8 million ) . Equipped with ultramodern machinery , it was designed to produce Vinyl Chloride Monomer ( VCM ) for use by the local plastics industry . Because of climate and technical problems , however , the machinery did not work satisfactorily , and by 1975 , operations were halted except for four or five months a year .  
Precision machinery and instruments , electronic , optical , metal , plastic , electrical , chemical and rubber products , machinery , cosmetics , leather products , toys , yachts and mobile homes , garments , medical instruments and appliances , sporting goods , musical instruments , educational materials and communications equipment are the major products of factories in the EPZs .  
By chemical injections into the roots , combined with periodic drainage of underground water during the heavy rain season , many of the trees have recovered their previous vitality . Matou pomelos , approximately palm sized , are round and plump at the base and pointed towards the top .  
As the economy industrialized , however , domestic makers began to supply spare parts and accessories and maintenance services , gradually developing the ability to make simple goods , until today where the product range extends from machines that make instant noodles to those that manufacture concrete and chemical products .  
Its main constituents are sulphuric acid and nitric acid , in the form of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen ( sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide ) which are formed by a complex chemical action .  
Explaining the reasons underlying soil acidification , Chang Hsueh-k'un , director of the Taoyuan Agricultural Improvement Farm , points out that in addition to factors such as the relatively high acidity of northern Taiwan 's red soil , the loss of alkaline cations from the soil through heavy rainfall and the heavy use of chemical fertilizers by Taiwan farmers , " sulphurous discharges released by Taiwan 's petrochemical plants are another reason why the soil is turning acidic . "  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
However , ailments such as cadmium , lead and mercury induced damage to the central nervous system , sterility and deformities , impairment of the immune system , damage to the respiratory system , liver poisoning and irreversible chronic poisoning are all on the rise . In relation to the chemical substances that are increasingly coming to permeate our daily lives , people are gradually coming to realize the risks they face from heavy metals .  
It is just that if you look at metals such as gold and iron , the former is extremely rare and inert and can not easily undergo chemical changes through combining with other materials , while the latter is used in huge quantities but is actually needed by the human body - - medics even recommend that we use iron cooking pots so as to provide us with supplementary iron .  
The National Film Archive took the films to a developing company , which gave them an ultrasonic cleaning , repaired the sections that were ripped and falling apart and then used all sorts of special printing machines and chemical techniques to blow up the negatives one frame at a time . Now the films look pretty much like they did back when they were released . All told , in personnel and materials , it cost about NT $ 400,000 to have these films preserved for another 50 years . "  
And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep . The Taiwanese connoisseur is quite sniffy about his cup of tea . As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
Wu Banghua expresses the view that although many researchers are applying themselves to analyzing the chemical structure or researching the physiological effects of substances from Taxus species , few are researching their botanical characteristics . However , " inappropriate exploitation of this valuable natural resource has already reduced the worldwide population reserves of Taxus species to very small numbers . "  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
Thirty-nine year old Chuang Yu-long has loved farming since his youth . After graduating from junior high school , he did n't continue formal studies , but took over the family lands , doing endless experiments on how to grow healthy , delicious vegetables and rice without the use of chemical fertilizers , herbicides or pesticides .  
Three years ago , Wu San-ho , an associate professor at National Taiwan University 's Department of Agriculture , heard of Chuang Yu-long 's ability to grow gorgeous , healthy crops on red clay without the use of chemical fertilizers . He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
In the waters off Korea a Ming dynasty wreck has been found whose cargo of lacquer ware came up looking brand new after sitting at the bottom of the salty sea for 400 years . And an experiment with two pieces of iron exposed to aqua regia have shown that the lacquer-treated piece still looks as good as new when the untreated piece has wholly disintegrated . Hence , most of the tables in chemical laboratories are coated with this natural substance .  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
After joining the faculty at New Haven University , Li used the university 's chemical analysis laboratory to help the police investigate criminal cases on numerous occasions . In 1979 , the Connecticut state police hired Li outright as their senior forensics expert , and he then rose through a number of positions to become the head of the entire Connecticut state police force in July , 1989 .  
Chromosomes , which carry the genetic blueprint for living organisms , are formed of tightly coiled strands of DNA , in which four chemical bases-designated A , T , G and C-are paired together in different combinations along a double-helix-shaped molecular chain . Certain sequences of base-pairs along these DNA strands form genes , and the totality of base pairs makes up the " genome . "  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
Tony Li explains that not all phenomena are suited to being displayed in a linear format like electrical resistance and pulse rates . The marvelous thing about sensors is that they can detect a great variety of physical and chemical changes and convert them into signals in the form of electical voltage or resistance , that can then be conveniently measured , analyzed and transmitted .  
Therefore , in the first decade of the FFTC 's existence , its programs were focused on soil and fertilizer management , the nutrient requirements of rice plants , and control of major rice pests . It was the first international center to specialize in control of rice brown plant hopper , which became much more destructive after the introduction of short-term high-yielding rice varieties and chemical pesticides .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
As well as the high incidence of oral clefts , the number of children born with craniofacial deformities in Vietnam is also very high . Clinicians believe this is related to factors such as environmental pollution caused by the use of chemical agents during the Vietnam War , and the low standard of living which means that most pregnant mothers are poorly nourished .  
In 1931 the National Government drafted the " Vocational School Regulations , " which divided such schools into four categories : Type A ( mining and metallurgy , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , chemical engineering , civil engineering ) , Type B ( agronomy , forestry , animal husbandry , fisheries ) , Type C ( banking , insurance , accounting , statistics , international trade ) and Type D ( medicine , pharmacy , art , music , physical education ) .  
As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
Wu said China 's reform and opening up as well as the sustainable , rapid , and steady economic progress have provided broad prospects for the petroleum and petro chemical industry , which was set by the government as one of the country 's pillar industries of the national economy  
It will be the largest modern chemical base in China To date , a number of prestigious transitional companies including Basf , Bayer and ICI have signed letters of intent with the zone , expecting to be settled down in the zone in four to five years  
the three day sixth round of foreign secretary level talks concluded here this morning with the singing of an agreement on a code of conduct for treatment of diplomats and a joint declaration on prohibition of chemical weapons  
However , even more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear , chemical , biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of their falling into the wrong hands .  
As agreed , separate expert groups in the chemical , biological , ballistic missile and nuclear areas met to pursue the objectives outlined above .  
The principle has been referred to and applied at the national level in relation to human activities with potentially severe effects on human health ( engineering , the pharmaceutical and chemical industries , nuclear power plants , etc . ) .  
UNCED further emphasized that gross chemical contamination , with grave damage to human health , genetic structures , reproductive outcomes , and the environment , continues to exist in some of the world 's most important industrial areas .  
UNEP / IRPTC carries data profiles relevant to the assessment of hazards and risks posed by chemical substances to human health and the environment , waste management , and legal information on national and international regulatory control measures .  
The resulting validated data sets are intended to provide a source of basic data of internationally recognized quality which are needed for assessing chemical risks in both national and international forums .  
The Netherlands has decided that , as a national objective , the maximum permissible chemical risk level for the public and the environment must not be exceeded by the year 2000 .  
A complete understanding of Iraq 's technical capabilities , manufacturing equipment , precursor suppliers and past chemical weapon production activities are essential if the Commission is to be confident that it is monitoring from a solid base .  
In certain key areas , there is an evident and growing trend in the trafficking and use of chemical and fissionable materials in conflicts , as well as the hidden or overt desire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons .  
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
By taking samples at the sites concerned , the group verified that quantities of the pure chemical were indeed present and that the size of the pits in which the chemical was buried was consistent , in general terms , with the quantities of the chemical Iraq declared to be buried there .  
These remaining issues are not of a magnitude that would affect the assessment as to whether Iraq has completed the substantive actions required of it under paragraphs 8 to 10 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) to eliminate its proscribed ballistic missile and chemical weapon and related facilities and to permit effective monitoring of its compliance in those areas .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
With respect to persistent organic pollutants , proposals were advanced for the global programme to initiate , directly , an intergovernmental process to consider and negotiate a global , legally binding instrument .  However , much of this legal development may focus more within the broad field of chemical safety .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
had decided to address themselves to the social and economic aspects of the scourge of drugs , to make reciprocal commitments that would lead to a significant and verifiable decline in consumption as well as a sharp reduction in supply , and to adopt energetic measures against money-laundering , distribution organizations , arms trafficking and illicit trafficking in chemical precursors .  
special concern , in this regard , has been the need to determine the full extent of Iraq 's programmes and to seek verification of Iraq 's claims to have destroyed all proscribed weapons , in particular its stocks of agent VX and its precursors , operational missile systems , all of its biological warfare agent and all of the aerial bombs and missile warheads that Iraq states it filled with various chemical and biological agents in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War .  
Council expressed its deep regret that the Government of Iraq was continuing to produce bacteriological weapons of a pestilential nature to inflict overwhelming damage on Iraq itself and on the region as a whole , in addition to its production of chemical and radioactive weapons that were no less dangerous and destructive .  
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
The unit employing this method , called TerraSURE , is capable of creating isolated , functional process reactors in the subsurface of hazardous waste sites , landfills or tailing deposits where in situ bio-remediation , chemical degradation and solvent extraction can be carried out .  
" Detector " : a mechanical , electrical , optical or chemical device that automatically identifies and records , or registers a stimulus such as an environmental change in pressure or temperature , an electrical or electromagnetic signal or radiation from a radioactive material .  
Potential carbon dioxide utilization , disposal , and storage options include enhanced oil recovery , storage in depleted natural gas fields and other underground reservoirs , chemical feedstocks and other basic material , and finally disposal in the deep ocean .  
Many delegations were concerned that subprogramme 1.3 emphasized the micro rather than the macro aspects of disarmament such as nuclear , chemical , bacteriological and conventional weapons .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
As I stated in my address to the General Assembly during the general debate on 7 October 1996 , the Taliban mercenaries used some type of chemical or internationally banned weapon against the forces of the Ministry of Defence of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on 25 and 26 September 1996 in Lata-band , Band-i-Ghazi and Pul-i-Charkhi , battlefield areas situated east of the capital , where the resistance against them was firm and tenacious .  
The Commission came to the unequivocal conclusion that Iraq had in fact produced biological weapons , that its biological programme was offensive in nature , that Al Hakam had been constructed as a dedicated biological warfare agent research and production facility and had been operational before January 1991 , and that additional sites , including Muthanna , a known chemical weapons establishment , were involved in the programme .  
The destruction of large chemical weapons stocks and of the sprawling biological weapons facility at Al Hakam , the neutralization of wide-ranging and diverse missile capabilities as well as the creation of a unique and effective monitoring and verification system are tangible examples of accomplishments over five and a half years .  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gasses , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 1 ] / as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 49 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
With the aim of integrating and consolidating national and international efforts to promote chemical safety , the Forum is to provide policy guidance , develop strategies in a coordinated and integrated manner , foster understanding of the issues , and promote the requested policy support needed to discharge those functions .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
During the last two years only , the inspections have led to the unmasking of : a complete biological weapons development and production programme ; highly sophisticated and advanced work on the extremely lethal chemical warfare nerve agent VX ; and the multifaceted domestic development and production of Scud-type missile engines under Iraq 's project 1728 .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Indeed , Israel has been actively supporting and participating in efforts of the international community to prevent the proliferation of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles , not least through export control mechanisms , inspired by those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) , the Australian Group ( AG ) , and the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , of which Israel is an adherent .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
Promising directions of cooperation of development of cooperative links in the mining and metallurgical , chemical and jewellery industries and light industry , mechanical engineering , building materials production , military industrial complexes and agro-industry complexes ; the establishment of inter-State industrial and financial groups and joint enterprises ; cooperation between transport department ; harmonization of the actions of the banking systems of Armenia and the Russian Federation ; and other joint actions taken in the light of the mutual economic interests of the two countries .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The application of double standards in the area of non-proliferation and the employment of non-transparent and exclusive export control mechanisms in the areas of nuclear , chemical and biological technology for peaceful uses are most destructive of international confidence and security .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
As in most developed-country markets , there are regulations which specify the types of packs that are acceptable and the information that labels must contain , and health regulations which are often justified both in terms of hygienic conditions and the use of harmful chemical additives , pesticides and fertilizers , but which can be so complicated and restrictive that they act as barriers for developing country suppliers .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
With water a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , the imperative remains to manage all freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality within minimum acceptable standards .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
In that case , Iraq had refused to accede to a request by a chief inspector to be furnished with a copy of a document highly pertinent to obtaining a verifiable material balance of Iraq 's munitions filled with chemical or biological agents .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
Within the framework of the WHO project , implemented in three stages , national specialists have been undergoing training , both abroad and in-country ; laboratories for analyses have been set up in provinces and towns ; and the necessary equipment , instruments , chemical substances and diagnostic devices for analysis have been supplied to urban and rural areas .  
Stress the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
Damage to oil refineries , fuel dumps and chemical and fertilizer factories , as well as the toxic smoke from huge fires and the leakage of harmful chemicals into the soil and the water table have contributed to as yet unassessed levels of environmental pollution in some urban areas , which may in turn have a negative impact on health and ecological systems .  
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
Sectors that have been the main targets for recent anti-dumping actions are metals and metal products , chemical products , machinery and electrical equipment , plastics and plastic products , textiles and clothing , pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material , prepared foodstuffs and beverages , stone and plaster products , other manufactured products , footwear and headgear .  
When the shell hits its target , normally a tank or an armoured car , it emits chemical and radioactive dust containing carcinogenic ionized atoms ( alpha-gamma ) that not only contaminates the area around the incinerated tank but is carried great distances on the wind and spread over a wide area , contaminating the air , soil , vegetation and human beings .  
In its fourth area of concentration , the UNEP approach , which emphasized the need for cleaner production , changing consumption patterns and the potential risk of chemical products , was based on the belief that the international community must stimulate the development of environmentally friendly technologies .  
Stresses the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , including the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
That region has suffered from brutal and savage conflicts for many years , most recently Iraq ' s wanton and brutal invasion of Kuwait , and the continuous threat to neighbouring countries posed by the Iraqi regime ' s use of chemical and biological weapons against its own people in northern Iraq .  
The Russian Federation has made progress in putting together a comprehensive programme for destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , including the identification of destruction sites , the technology needed for destruction , protection of the environment , the agencies responsible and the overall financial requirements , which has been approved by President Yeltsin . A draft law , which will establish the legal framework for destruction , has received its first hearing in the Duma .  
What the Convention will do is create a system that makes that extremely difficult as a practical matter , because of its system of monitoring sensitive chemicals , its challenge inspection provisions , its economic and political sanctions , and by creating a forum for determining collective action to combat the threat of chemical weapons .  
While control over the regulation of all aspects of the production and supply of drugs and psychotropic substances had been tightened in health care and scientific institutions and in the chemical industry , severely weakened institutional accountability , as well as an underdeveloped system for formulating and implementing regulations impeded control and oversight .  
In fifth place , as regards general disarmament , we emphasize the need to advance towards total elimination of nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons ; illicit trafficking in small arms , and the use of antipersonnel mines and explosive devices .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining both human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
All missiles capable of carrying warheads with nuclear , bacteriological and chemical agents should be banned from future production and current stockpiles should be gradually reduced and finally destroyed .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
With regard to the use of non-controlled substitute chemicals in the illicit manufacture of drugs , the substances and guidelines included in the limited international special surveillance list established by the Board were a useful tool for Governments , promoting awareness and cooperation with the chemical industry to prevent diversion of those substances .  
Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
The aim of the Recommendations for Guidance is to define the biological , chemical , geological and physical components to be measured and the procedures to be followed by the Contractor to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from its activities in the Area , and to provide guidance to prospective contractors in preparing plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules .  
Quality of life is declining in urban areas , with losses of housing and of human lives caused by erosion , siltation and flooding ; general insalubrity owing to the lack of appropriate solid and liquid waste management systems ; severe overcrowding caused both by the population explosion and by uncontrollable concentrations of population ; physical and chemical degradation of land ; pollution of all kinds ; and above all , deforestation on the periphery of urban areas . 
It is our hope that the country concerned will work out a comprehensive and practical destruction programme as soon as possible in accordance with its obligations under the Convention , which should guarantee the safety of the local people and the environment so that the substantive destruction process can be started and the grave danger posed by the abandoned chemical weapons can be eliminated within the time frame set forth in the Convention .  
The full implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention must be seen as an urgent endeavour of the international community with a view to eliminating all chemical arsenals , verifying industrial activities using sensitive chemicals , promoting increasing cooperation for peaceful uses , and controlling the international exchange of sensitive chemicals , a task entrusted to the OPCW but regrettably not yet implemented despite the wish of the majority of States parties .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
We note with the deepest concern the close connections between international terrorism and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other deadly materials , as a paramount threat to international peace and security at the dawn of the new millennium .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
Our close cooperation becomes urgent when it is realized that a small group of terrorists can actually possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical ones , and destroy large areas of the world and millions of innocent people with wilful abandon , senselessly and indiscriminately .  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,  
Last year alone , the Bank of China provided an accumulated total of more than 69 billion yuan of RMB loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  In addition , the bank also issued more than 4-billion US dollars in the form of foreign exchange rate and spot exchange rate loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  These loans were mainly to support the basic raw materials , chemical , and mechanical industries , etc .  
Having gone through the deficit phase incurred by the whole industry in the last half year , China 's chemical industry completed an annual gross industrial output value of 278-billion yuan , with a growth rate of 8% , and continuing to maintain steady growth .  
The detachment also made use of the technological advantages of colleges , and launched several special firing experiments under the guidance of college experts , including antitank missile cross-water firing , pitch angle firing , and firing in nuclear and chemical warfare .  They obtained a huge amount of first-hand information , and accumulated precious experiences .  Based on their training results , they compiled the " training outlines , " which were promulgated and implemented by the whole army .  
It is known that major Indian exports to China are aquatic products , iron sand , and cotton yarn , while major imports from China are organic chemical products , electronic products , coal , and cotton thread .  The volume of bilateral trade between China and India for 1999 totaled about $ 2-billion .  
We will further strengthen our four major pillar industries of the processing industry of agricultural and sideline products , the energy industry , the metallurgical industry , and the chemical industry ; speed up the development of our four dominant industries of rare earth , biological technology , information , and heavy-duty vehicles ; take the ideological emancipation as the guide , and uphold the principle that " development is the last word " ;  
The secondary industry should work hard to readjust the internal structure ; enhance the technical innovation capability ; apply advanced technologies and high technologies to transform and upgrade traditional industries and to transform metallurgical , chemical , machinery , building materials , and some other basic industries ;  
They tried 290 cases of selling food below sanitary standards or poisonous harmful food , products below safety standards , counterfeit medicine , as well as counterfeit and bad quality agricultural chemicals , animal medicine , chemical fertilizers , and seeds , an increase of 24 percent over the previous year , involving the punishment of 267 criminals .  
The United States , mouthing human rights , in the end utilized concentrated bombing and depleted uranium bombs - - weapons prohibited by international law , and bombed residential sites , schools , hospital , and other civilian targets , even flagrantly bombing chemical installations , causing the spread of chemicals and reagents , seemingly carrying out chemical warfare .  
We must efficiently manage the agricultural materials market by firmly cracking down on illegal sales as well as striking at those who harm peasants ' interests by selling fake and poor quality seeds , chemical fertilizers , and farm chemicals .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
It has set up a number of specialized laboratories for nuclear and chemical protection research and experiments .  It has a high-level contingent of scientists and researchers .  Over the years , it has attained a number of scientific research achievements that are up to advanced world standards in the field of nuclear and chemical protection .  
At that time our country 's capacity for screening chemical compounds was less than one-tenth of that of a single US research institute .  Despite the circumstances , members of the project group were determined to carry out innovative research .  Eventually they triumphed over their powerful adversaries , smashed the preoccupation that " developing countries are unable to develop new drugs " and captured the world 's commanding height of developing the anti-malaria drug .  
Located in border and coastal areas , Dandong city has many chemical plants .  To step up preparations for military struggles and prevent sudden environmental pollution incidents , the Dandong city government and the army units stationed there gathered materials relevant to the urban unclear and chemical plants attacked during the Gulf War and Kosovo War and drew up a meticulous and thorough emergency plan .  
Bearing in mind Dandong 's key antichemical warfare work targets , the antichemical warfare detachment of the local troops conducted the exploratory drill to counter possible direct or indirect use of chemical weapons by the enemy in future warfare .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
The equipment for the mass defense of military units is in the main complete with quality reaching a good standard .  The preventive capability by specialized anti-chemical warfare units and the overall preventive capability of the Army , the Navy , the Air Force and the Second Artillery Corps have all been significantly improved .  The military units ' fighting capability under the threat of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons has been significantly strengthened .  
We should lay stress on solving urgent subjects in the protection against chemical warfare in main battles and further improve military theory on anti-chemical warfare .  We should gradually establish a scientific and effective research system and provide theoretical guidance for training military units with science and technology and the development of anti-chemical warfare .  
Such equipment is based on modern analytic and laboratory test technology , detecting and warning technology , automatic control technology , and digital communication technology as well as represented by armored chemical agent-detecting vehicles and nuclear agent-detecting robots .  This kind of equipment for detecting nuclear and chemical agents in the battlefield - - with wheel-type chassis-mounted vehicles as the backbone and with series of chassis-mounted vehicles as supplements - - can operate in contaminated areas under all kinds of situations .  
At present , our military units have composite decontamination equipment , multifunctional and rapid decontamination equipment , and one-man decontamination equipment , thus forming a complete equipment system .  Such a system , which is comprehensive in function and in technical means , can do a good job in decontaminating the pollution caused by nuclear , chemical , and biological weapons .  Our military units can enter an area contaminated by nuclear and chemical pollution to carry out decontamination work .  
Pilotless combat planes can complete various missions without the limitations set by the human body , such as approaching close to forward positions , carrying ground tracking sensors , synthetic aperture radar sensors , moving target indicators , and so on , or else doing on-the-spot monitoring of chemical and biological substances .  
The first possibility that Bush considered was to established ship-based interceptors , because the technology of ship-based interception is relatively realistic and mature , and in addition such interceptors can enable the United States to detect incoming enemy missiles earlier , and the fragments of the intercepted missiles ( including any chemical or biological warheads ) will fall on the country that launches them instead of on the United States .  
We will selectively support a group of backbone enterprises in the energy , metallurgy , chemical , light , textile , machinery , automobile , building materials , and construction industries in their efforts to carry out technical transformation and improve the standards of their technology and equipment while working around the goals of increasing product varieties , improving quality , conserving energy , preventing and controlling pollution , expanding exports , and improving labor productivity .  
The operational concept of " full dimensional protection " which was proposed by the US military in 1996 calls for the establishment of both offensive and defensive measures to deal with information warfare , guided missiles , and nuclear , biological , and chemical weapons of mass destruction .  
These officials believe that the new US administration has two " nails in the eye and thorns in the flesh " : The first is what Americans say is Iraq 's concealed underground biological and chemical weapons stores , and the second is the nuclear command centers which , they say , Russia is hurrying to build , hidden deep in the mountains .  
Compared to ordinary fighters , the unmanned Stealth fighter is more suited to carrying out highly difficult missions , such as long-range surprise attacks on enemy targets with dense air defenses , sneak attacks on enemy biological and chemical weapon bases , and interception of cruise missiles , and so on .  
The article notes that while the United States indeed faces certain new threats in the " new strategic environment " that has appeared after the Cold War , the main threat the United States faces today is not intercontinental ballistic missiles , but terrorism , such as the ignition of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons that terrorists have smuggled into US ports . 
Yuanfang of the Yadong Group which has been investing in the mainland 's upstream chemical fiber and downstream garment industries in recent years made profits across the board last year .  Yuandong Industry 's ( Shanghai ) after-tax profit topped NT $ 890-million , and this year it will vigorously pursue vertical integration to set up an entire production line of spinning , weaving , and dyeing and will invest another $ 50-million , equivalent to NT $ 1.7-billion .  
Many large-scale military exercises have shown the newest achievements that China 's military has obtained from the traditional " three attacks and three defenses " - - attacking tanks , planes , and airborne troops , and defending against nuclear , chemical , and biological attacks - - to the " new three attacks and three defenses " of attacking stealth aircraft , cruise missiles , and helicopter gun ships , and defending against precision strikes , electronic jamming , and reconnaissance and surveillance .  
At the same time , in line with the features of the establishment of external units , the base has provided the " Blue Army " with infantry , artillery , armored , engineering , chemical , communication , electronic confrontation , and helicopter troops - - which form a joint training command headquarters with the air force and the army aviation unit - - and has copied military drills and training conducted by powerful adversaries . 
The nation 's discharge of sulfur dioxide , chemical oxygen demand , dust , industrial solid waste and other major pollutants should be cut by 10 percent relative to 2000 ' s level .  In particular , the emission of sulfur dioxide in the " two controlled " zones should be reduced by 20 percent compared to 2000 ' s levels .  
After China 's " entry into WTO , " China 's automobile , pharmaceutical , chemical , agricultural , and service industries will be faced with the pressure of competition in the short-run .  The entering of foreign goods into China 's market will have some adverse influence on China 's national industries .  However , there is not a single country going bankrupt due to " entry into WTO . "  
Great efforts should be made to rejuvenate the technical equipment manufacturing industry , form a relatively complete system for the integrated production of mechanical and electrical products covering forging , casting , processing , and power equipment , as well as mining , metallurgical , chemical , and building equipment , set up a transport machine-building system for the manufacture of advanced automobiles , ships , and track communications , and enhance the ability in developing and manufacturing complete sets of major equipments .

the manufacturing industrial departments with a medium ( less than 50 percent ) effective protection rate include paper , petroleum , chemical industry , basic chemical products , chemical fiber , rubber , plastics , nonmetallic minerals , ferroalloy processing , and nonmetal processing industry ;  
They said they started the war to keep stable the Yugoslav Federation 's situation and to halt military conflicts and disputes , namely , with good intentions , but what followed was : The people were plunged into misery and suffering , the national economy fell back 20 years , and the natural environment and people 's lives were threatened by prolonged pollution from nuclear radiation and chemical and poisonous gases We can not help asking : Can a war solve any problem ? 
The two sides are committed to a world free from nuclear , biological or chemical weapons .  They stressed that the international regime for eliminating and prohibiting the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be permanently and indiscriminately applicable to all regions and countries with no exception .  
And at the same time both sides took note of the legitimate rights of any country for peaceful uses of nuclear energy , chemical and biological technology in a transparent manner under the supervision of the relevant international organizations .  
Thanks to this " three attacks and three defenses " training , all military units generally acquired the skills of attacking tanks , aircraft , and paratroopers and the skills of defending against nuclear attack , chemical warfare , and biological weapons .  At the same time , People 's Liberation Army [ PLA ] training has developed by leaps and bounds as a result .  
Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is mutually beneficial .  Japan 's yen loans to China and its official development aid have played and will continue to play an important role in China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization ; the attitude of the Japanese Government on the historical problem is generally speaking continuing to make progress , and Japan is now taking a more responsible attitude in handling the problems of chemical weapons left behind in China .  
After the readjustment , the average tariffs for major products will be as follows : 3 percent for mineral products , 7.4 percent for metals , 10.6 percent for chemical products , 12.3 percent for forestry products , 14.3 percent for mechanical and electrical products and instruments , 14.8 percent for light industry products , 17.8 percent for building materials , 19 percent for farm produce , 21.1 percent for textile products , and 24 percent for transportation vehicles .  
The CWC is an important international disarmament treaty against proliferation .  It aims at the comprehensive ban and complete destruction of weapons of mass destruction .  Accordingly , the Convention seeks to exercise control and monitoring over the destruction of chemical weapons and civilian industrial enterprises producing relevant chemicals through the mandatory declaration of data and on-site inspections .  
The Statistics Department pointed out that , during the period from 1994 to 1998 , our country purchased $ 13.3 billion , or 11.9 percent , of regular weapons ( excluding controlled nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , and biochemical weapons ) sold around the world , making our country the world 's largest weapon importing country .  The major countries where Taiwan purchased its weapons from were : The United States , $ 8.1 billion ; and France , $ 5.15 billion .  
and the industrial and commercial and technical supervisory departments must strengthen management of the markets for seed , chemical fertilizer , and pesticides , crack down on counterfeit and inferior goods , and prevent cheating of the peasants .  
enhance the overall quality and competitiveness of industry ; speed up the development of such pillar industries as electronics and information , hydropower , machinery and metallurgy , medicine and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs ; and strive to build up eight major industrial bases for electronics and information , hydropower , heavy machinery and equipment , special steel products , new vanadium-titanium materials , modern Chinese medicine , natural gas and chemical industry , and beverages and foodstuffs .  
The licensing control on strategic commodities aims at ensuring Hong Kong 's continued access to high - technology goods and up-to-date technology which are essential for maintaining Hong Kong 's status as a regional centre of finance , trade , banking and telecommunication , and preventing Hong Kong from being used as a conduit for the proliferation of strategically - sensitive goods , arms , munitions or chemical / biological / nuclear weapons .  
On the other hand , output of other industry groups registered year-on-year increases in the fourth quarter of 1997 .  They included the textiles ( including knitting ) industry ( + 5.5% ) , paper products and printing industry ( + 4.0% ) , chemical , rubber , plastic and non-metallic mineral products industry ( + 1.9% ) and miscellaneous manufacturing industries ( + 6.9% ) .  
Holders of valid Dumping Licences for public filling areas may be permitted to dump materials such as earth , building debris , broken rock and concrete at the barging point provided that the materials are free from marine mud , household refuse , plastic , metal , industrial and chemical waste , animal and vegetable matter and other materials considered unsuitable . 
The Water Supplies Department ( WSD ) conducts physical , chemical , radiological and bacteriological tests on treated water .  More than 100 tests are carried out , including general tests , tests on heavy metal , organic and inorganic compounds , and those listed under the 1993 Guidelines of the WHO .  
" The working group will continue to take a more pro-active role in controlling flytipping , through extension of opening hours for public filling areas and public barging points and giving farmers instructions on how to dispose of animal carcasses . "  " Other controlling measures include strengthening legislation on trip-ticket system for disposal of construction and demolition material , and circulating guidelines to assist the staff of its member departments in the clearance of illegal dumping of chemical waste materials , " he added .  
A Government spokesman said today ( Monday ) that the Dutiable Commodities ( Amendment ) Bill 1999 ( " the Bill " ) would be introduced to address two major practical difficulties encountered by C &amp; amp ; ED in taking prosecution action under such prohibitive provisions .  One lies in proving the supply of certain illicit fuel , while the other relates to proving the use of detreated oil ( oil with its chemical marker illegally removed ) or dutiable light diesel oil as fuel by vehicles .  
As for other industries , notable decreases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the professional and optical equipment industry ( by about $ 1.3 billion or 39% to $ 2.1 billion ) ; the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by about $ 0.1 billion or 9% to $ 1.4 billion ) ; and the plastic products industry ( by about $ 0.1 billion or 20% to $ 0.6 billion ) .  
Analysed by industry group , significant decreases in output were identified in the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( - 20.9% ) and the chemical , rubber , plastic and non-metallic mineral products industry ( - 14.9% ) when compared with a year earlier , while output of the paper products and printing industry showed a marginal decrease of 0.6% .  
As for the other industries , notable increases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( by $ 0.5 billion or 36% to $ 1.9 billion ) ; the paper and paper products , printing and publishing industry ( by $ 0.3 billion or 25% to $ 1.5 billion ) ; and the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by $ 0.2 billion or 15% to $ 1.4 billion ) .

On the other hand , output of the chemical , rubber , plastic and non-metallic mineral products industry decreased by 15.7% and that of the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry decreased by 12.1% .  
On the other hand , output of the chemical , rubber , plastic and non-metallic mineral products industry decreased by 13.2% , and that of the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry by 11.4% .  
The review endorsed the basic features of the current TES scheme , including the use of volume and strength of effluent discharged as the technical basis of charging , determination of the volume of effluent discharged from the volume of fresh water supplied , the use of chemical oxygen demand as the parameter for the strength of effluent , and the application of generic values for effluent strength to all trades .  
According to the information released , the EU decided to temporarily suspend the import of all Mainland China 's products of animal origin intended for human consumption or for use in animal feed with effect from 30 January 2002 .  This decision was made in the light of an inspection report on the control of chemical residues in live animals and animal products in the Mainland compiled by the EU 's Food and Veterinary Office . The main products being suspended include honey , rabbit meat , poultry and crustacean food such as shrimps and prawns .  
( c ) We have always encouraged the environmental industry to recover and recycle different kinds of materials .  Hence , the CWTC and some private chemical waste disposal facilities have been recycling chemical waste .  Examples include the recovery of copper oxide from spent etchant ; fuel from oily water waste ; production of lubricating oil , hydraulic oil and moulding oil from different types of recycled waste oil ; silver from photofinishing waste ; and precious metals such as gold and silver from spent plating solution .  
A joint venture of six private chemical firms , the plant was completed in May 1973 , with a total capitalization of NT $ 320 million ( US $ 8 million ) . Equipped with ultramodern machinery , it was designed to produce Vinyl Chloride Monomer ( VCM ) for use by the local plastics industry . Because of climate and technical problems , however , the machinery did not work satisfactorily , and by 1975 , operations were halted except for four or five months a year .  
Precision machinery and instruments , electronic , optical , metal , plastic , electrical , chemical and rubber products , machinery , cosmetics , leather products , toys , yachts and mobile homes , garments , medical instruments and appliances , sporting goods , musical instruments , educational materials and communications equipment are the major products of factories in the EPZs .  
By chemical injections into the roots , combined with periodic drainage of underground water during the heavy rain season , many of the trees have recovered their previous vitality . Matou pomelos , approximately palm sized , are round and plump at the base and pointed towards the top .  
As the economy industrialized , however , domestic makers began to supply spare parts and accessories and maintenance services , gradually developing the ability to make simple goods , until today where the product range extends from machines that make instant noodles to those that manufacture concrete and chemical products .  
Its main constituents are sulphuric acid and nitric acid , in the form of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen ( sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide ) which are formed by a complex chemical action .  
Explaining the reasons underlying soil acidification , Chang Hsueh-k'un , director of the Taoyuan Agricultural Improvement Farm , points out that in addition to factors such as the relatively high acidity of northern Taiwan 's red soil , the loss of alkaline cations from the soil through heavy rainfall and the heavy use of chemical fertilizers by Taiwan farmers , " sulphurous discharges released by Taiwan 's petrochemical plants are another reason why the soil is turning acidic . "  
Naturally it would be panic-mongering to suggest that all of these are dangerous to humans , because many of them have an insignificant impact on the human body . For some it is simply a matter of keeping the volume below a certain " permissible amount . " Thus most advanced countries have stipulated methods of controlling chemical products , estimating their danger , the paths by which they are released , and the proper dosages , and setting the scope for their use and permissible amounts within a safe range .  
Despite this , the " neither large nor small " numbers of cases of these illnesses still leave people a little non-plussed when they see them . The threats to life and health from modern industrial society come from stress and environmental pollution - - cancer , heart disease , asthma , infertility , and other " diseases of modern civilization " caused by chemical or biological agents . Have n't these acute communicable illnesses transmitted by bacteria or viruses already been eradicated ?  
However , ailments such as cadmium , lead and mercury induced damage to the central nervous system , sterility and deformities , impairment of the immune system , damage to the respiratory system , liver poisoning and irreversible chronic poisoning are all on the rise . In relation to the chemical substances that are increasingly coming to permeate our daily lives , people are gradually coming to realize the risks they face from heavy metals .  
It is just that if you look at metals such as gold and iron , the former is extremely rare and inert and can not easily undergo chemical changes through combining with other materials , while the latter is used in huge quantities but is actually needed by the human body - - medics even recommend that we use iron cooking pots so as to provide us with supplementary iron .  
The National Film Archive took the films to a developing company , which gave them an ultrasonic cleaning , repaired the sections that were ripped and falling apart and then used all sorts of special printing machines and chemical techniques to blow up the negatives one frame at a time . Now the films look pretty much like they did back when they were released . All told , in personnel and materials , it cost about NT $ 400,000 to have these films preserved for another 50 years . "  
And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep . The Taiwanese connoisseur is quite sniffy about his cup of tea . As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
Wu Banghua expresses the view that although many researchers are applying themselves to analyzing the chemical structure or researching the physiological effects of substances from Taxus species , few are researching their botanical characteristics . However , " inappropriate exploitation of this valuable natural resource has already reduced the worldwide population reserves of Taxus species to very small numbers . "  
What 's really depressing about this highway is the desolate vista presented by the heavy industry lining both sides . Whatever kind of grey and ugly industrial form you can think of-concrete factories , petroleum refineries , rusting old oil drums , discarded tire dumps , corrugated-steel structures put up without regard to building codes , construction machinery parks , steel smelters , chemical companies , oil pipeline , huge storage towers-they are all here . There 's only one thing you ca n't find , in fact : a tall green tree .  
Thirty-nine year old Chuang Yu-long has loved farming since his youth . After graduating from junior high school , he did n't continue formal studies , but took over the family lands , doing endless experiments on how to grow healthy , delicious vegetables and rice without the use of chemical fertilizers , herbicides or pesticides .  
Three years ago , Wu San-ho , an associate professor at National Taiwan University 's Department of Agriculture , heard of Chuang Yu-long 's ability to grow gorgeous , healthy crops on red clay without the use of chemical fertilizers . He led a group of students who spent several days at the farm doing on-site experiments .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
Chen Shu says that as an agent , of course he wants to make sure all the paperwork proceeds smoothly , and yet the required paperwork for fishing vessels to enter and exit the harbor is very complicated . Argentina is very strict on safety , as strict as any developed country . It requires stringent guards against environmental pollution-oil can not be poured directly into the sea , and there must be oil and water filtering mechanisms , chemical treatment of human waste , foot activation devices for washing hands , and so on .  
In the waters off Korea a Ming dynasty wreck has been found whose cargo of lacquer ware came up looking brand new after sitting at the bottom of the salty sea for 400 years . And an experiment with two pieces of iron exposed to aqua regia have shown that the lacquer-treated piece still looks as good as new when the untreated piece has wholly disintegrated . Hence , most of the tables in chemical laboratories are coated with this natural substance .  
It is precisely this use of synergistic combinations of natural substances-both from animals and plants-as opposed to the use of individually active chemical substances , " says Chang , who holds a doctorate in chemistry and is certified as a doctor of Chinese medicine . If only individual active components from herbal medicines are extracted and used , then the special synergistic character of herbal medicines will be lost .  
" In researching Chinese medicine , both developing new medicines and respecting the ancient Chinese medical principles are essential , " argues Chen Chieh-pu . Synthesizing chemical components or extracting new drugs from natural herbal , mineral or animal substances has long been an important process in mainstream medicine . Quinine , which is used to treat malaria ; the cardiotonic rehmannin ; the painkiller morphine ; and antibiotics , which are widely used and have saved so many ; were all discovered in natural herbal medicines or fungi .  
First , the supplies of electrical power , chemical aerosols and liquid solvents had to be shut down . Then the water used to fight the fire had to be stopped before it reached the rainwater drainage channels ; it was pumped to the water treatment facility . Solvents remaining inside pipes within the burning factory had to be collected , and both the chemicals and the scrapped equipment from the factory had to be given to qualified environmental engineers for disposal .  
After joining the faculty at New Haven University , Li used the university 's chemical analysis laboratory to help the police investigate criminal cases on numerous occasions . In 1979 , the Connecticut state police hired Li outright as their senior forensics expert , and he then rose through a number of positions to become the head of the entire Connecticut state police force in July , 1989 .  
Chromosomes , which carry the genetic blueprint for living organisms , are formed of tightly coiled strands of DNA , in which four chemical bases-designated A , T , G and C-are paired together in different combinations along a double-helix-shaped molecular chain . Certain sequences of base-pairs along these DNA strands form genes , and the totality of base pairs makes up the " genome . "  
Fundamental Buddhism not only seeks spiritual tranquility and enlightenment , it can also overcome all kinds of limitations imposed by the human body , and create changes of a chemical and physical nature . Because the spiritual and physical are connected , one 's mental state has physical consequences , and one can change the physical world using mental powers-when you have reached a certain level in your practice , the spiritual and the physical are interchangeable .  
Tony Li explains that not all phenomena are suited to being displayed in a linear format like electrical resistance and pulse rates . The marvelous thing about sensors is that they can detect a great variety of physical and chemical changes and convert them into signals in the form of electical voltage or resistance , that can then be conveniently measured , analyzed and transmitted .  
Therefore , in the first decade of the FFTC 's existence , its programs were focused on soil and fertilizer management , the nutrient requirements of rice plants , and control of major rice pests . It was the first international center to specialize in control of rice brown plant hopper , which became much more destructive after the introduction of short-term high-yielding rice varieties and chemical pesticides .  
Over the last 20 years scientists have discovered that materials behave differently at nanometric levels than they do in amounts visible to the naked eye . Just as the fundamental properties of a substance will change in a vacuum or at low temperatures , substances at nanometric sizes will undergo various physical and chemical changes . By singling out certain characteristics-such as strength or ductility-you can then go on to create countless products with new functions . Take , for instance , gold .  
As well as the high incidence of oral clefts , the number of children born with craniofacial deformities in Vietnam is also very high . Clinicians believe this is related to factors such as environmental pollution caused by the use of chemical agents during the Vietnam War , and the low standard of living which means that most pregnant mothers are poorly nourished .  
In 1931 the National Government drafted the " Vocational School Regulations , " which divided such schools into four categories : Type A ( mining and metallurgy , mechanical engineering , electrical engineering , chemical engineering , civil engineering ) , Type B ( agronomy , forestry , animal husbandry , fisheries ) , Type C ( banking , insurance , accounting , statistics , international trade ) and Type D ( medicine , pharmacy , art , music , physical education ) .  
As for using garbage for compost , this approach also boasts a long history . In the 1970s , Taiwan built more than 20 composting sites . However , the poor quality of the compost produced from unsorted garbage made it inferior to chemical fertilizers , which were cheap and of good quality . Farmers gradually came to rely on chemical fertilizers , and processors of organic refuse went out of business as sales stagnated .  
They said that except the construction sector , most industries are recovering , and , in particular , the indices for the basic raw material industry and the chemical industry " are more positive " Even the sector of consumer 's goods , which has been under the pressure of low demands , showed signs of growing  
Wu said China 's reform and opening up as well as the sustainable , rapid , and steady economic progress have provided broad prospects for the petroleum and petro chemical industry , which was set by the government as one of the country 's pillar industries of the national economy  
It will be the largest modern chemical base in China To date , a number of prestigious transitional companies including Basf , Bayer and ICI have signed letters of intent with the zone , expecting to be settled down in the zone in four to five years  
the three day sixth round of foreign secretary level talks concluded here this morning with the singing of an agreement on a code of conduct for treatment of diplomats and a joint declaration on prohibition of chemical weapons  
However , even more worrying is the potential proliferation of nuclear , chemical , biological and ballistic missiles - the danger of their falling into the wrong hands .  
As agreed , separate expert groups in the chemical , biological , ballistic missile and nuclear areas met to pursue the objectives outlined above .  
The principle has been referred to and applied at the national level in relation to human activities with potentially severe effects on human health ( engineering , the pharmaceutical and chemical industries , nuclear power plants , etc . ) .  
UNCED further emphasized that gross chemical contamination , with grave damage to human health , genetic structures , reproductive outcomes , and the environment , continues to exist in some of the world 's most important industrial areas .  
UNEP / IRPTC carries data profiles relevant to the assessment of hazards and risks posed by chemical substances to human health and the environment , waste management , and legal information on national and international regulatory control measures .  
The resulting validated data sets are intended to provide a source of basic data of internationally recognized quality which are needed for assessing chemical risks in both national and international forums .  
The Netherlands has decided that , as a national objective , the maximum permissible chemical risk level for the public and the environment must not be exceeded by the year 2000 .  
A complete understanding of Iraq 's technical capabilities , manufacturing equipment , precursor suppliers and past chemical weapon production activities are essential if the Commission is to be confident that it is monitoring from a solid base .  
In certain key areas , there is an evident and growing trend in the trafficking and use of chemical and fissionable materials in conflicts , as well as the hidden or overt desire of some countries to possess nuclear weapons .  
It had a crash programme to build a nuclear weapon in 1990-1991 ; it had weaponized live biological agents , including the deadly botulin and anthrax organisms , weapons never before used in warfare ; it produced a far greater quantity of chemical weapons , in more diverse forms , than it had previously admitted ; and it deliberately kept these documents hidden from the United Nations Special Commission ( UNSCOM ) , even as it was claiming that all information had been handed over .  
Civil and external wars could occur in regions where the possession of advanced weaponry , such as medium-range missiles with chemical , biological or even nuclear warheads , by ambitious and threatened regimes becomes a potentially lethal prospect . 
On the international level , it must be acknowledged that , despite the modest progress achieved in the control of nuclear , chemical and conventional weapons , these weapons have unfortunately increased qualitatively and quantitatively to an alarming degree .  
As anticipation mounts for the entry into force of the Convention , efforts need to be intensified to resolve the pending issues , including particularly those related to the definition of chemical weapons , inspection procedures , challenge inspections , and old , abandoned , dumped and buried chemical weapons , as well as the fundamental issue of the peaceful use of chemical material and technology to ensure the finalization of the preparatory work as soon as possible .  
Apart from the obligations to prevent proliferation derived from the existing disarmament agreements , the European Union considers the measures taken on export controls to be useful instruments in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , their object being to stem proliferation without detriment to transfers of material , equipment and technology for peaceful purposes in the nuclear , chemical , biological and space-research fields .  
Calls upon all States in the Middle East to take practical steps in appropriate forums aimed at making progress towards , inter alia , the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction , nuclear , chemical and biological , and their delivery systems , and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective .  
As far as production is concerned , the use of input and materials ( intense or otherwise ) and the adoption of technologies ( i.e . , whether they are environmentally sound or not ) may well determine both the level of industrial waste generation and the chemical and physical properties of products , with implications for the use and disposal stages .  
Accusations , such as producing and stockpiling chemical weapons and trying to develop nuclear weapons and building up conventional arms , are concocted apparently in order to frighten Iran 's neighbours , justify an illegitimate foreign military presence in the Persian Gulf , and impose a costly and unnecessary arms sale to the countries of the region .  
Needless to say that these allegations are mainly propagated by a Government which has been the primary supporter and sponsor of Israel 's State-sponsored terrorism , of its aggressive policies , and of its production of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , and has also backed despotic Governments which have not experienced parliamentarianism , consultation and elections in their political life even for a single day .  
By taking samples at the sites concerned , the group verified that quantities of the pure chemical were indeed present and that the size of the pits in which the chemical was buried was consistent , in general terms , with the quantities of the chemical Iraq declared to be buried there .  
These remaining issues are not of a magnitude that would affect the assessment as to whether Iraq has completed the substantive actions required of it under paragraphs 8 to 10 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) to eliminate its proscribed ballistic missile and chemical weapon and related facilities and to permit effective monitoring of its compliance in those areas .  
Military doctrines of the States in the region should be exclusively defensive and in all respects adapted to the international agreements on restricted use of military force and non-use of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons ;  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
With respect to persistent organic pollutants , proposals were advanced for the global programme to initiate , directly , an intergovernmental process to consider and negotiate a global , legally binding instrument .  However , much of this legal development may focus more within the broad field of chemical safety .  
Strongly support United Nations , regional and national efforts on arms control , limitation and disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , in all aspects , and other weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons and other forms of particularly excessively injurious or indiscriminate weapons , in pursuit of our common commitment to a world free of all these weapons ;  
had decided to address themselves to the social and economic aspects of the scourge of drugs , to make reciprocal commitments that would lead to a significant and verifiable decline in consumption as well as a sharp reduction in supply , and to adopt energetic measures against money-laundering , distribution organizations , arms trafficking and illicit trafficking in chemical precursors .  
special concern , in this regard , has been the need to determine the full extent of Iraq 's programmes and to seek verification of Iraq 's claims to have destroyed all proscribed weapons , in particular its stocks of agent VX and its precursors , operational missile systems , all of its biological warfare agent and all of the aerial bombs and missile warheads that Iraq states it filled with various chemical and biological agents in the period immediately preceding the Gulf War .  
Council expressed its deep regret that the Government of Iraq was continuing to produce bacteriological weapons of a pestilential nature to inflict overwhelming damage on Iraq itself and on the region as a whole , in addition to its production of chemical and radioactive weapons that were no less dangerous and destructive .  
The increased number and growing sophistication of lethal nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons of mass destruction and the further development of their intercontinental delivery systems heightens the threat of annihilation for many countries and peoples , especially when some of the countries which possess them lack even minimal credibility .  
Humanity can be sheltered from the tragedy of massively destructive wars only through the full and complete elimination of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons under effective international control .  
In this regard , they endorse the commitment made at the seventh meeting of the Andean Presidential Council to strengthen existing ties of cooperation with a view to developing common policies and actions to promote closer cooperation with other countries and regional groupings in order to pursue a concerted , comprehensive effort to combat all of the crimes related to the phenomenon of drugs and illicit substances , including their production , distribution and consumption ; money-laundering ; the diversion of chemical precursors ; and illegal trade in light arms .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
The unit employing this method , called TerraSURE , is capable of creating isolated , functional process reactors in the subsurface of hazardous waste sites , landfills or tailing deposits where in situ bio-remediation , chemical degradation and solvent extraction can be carried out .  
" Detector " : a mechanical , electrical , optical or chemical device that automatically identifies and records , or registers a stimulus such as an environmental change in pressure or temperature , an electrical or electromagnetic signal or radiation from a radioactive material .  
Potential carbon dioxide utilization , disposal , and storage options include enhanced oil recovery , storage in depleted natural gas fields and other underground reservoirs , chemical feedstocks and other basic material , and finally disposal in the deep ocean .  
Many delegations were concerned that subprogramme 1.3 emphasized the micro rather than the macro aspects of disarmament such as nuclear , chemical , bacteriological and conventional weapons .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
As I stated in my address to the General Assembly during the general debate on 7 October 1996 , the Taliban mercenaries used some type of chemical or internationally banned weapon against the forces of the Ministry of Defence of the Islamic State of Afghanistan on 25 and 26 September 1996 in Lata-band , Band-i-Ghazi and Pul-i-Charkhi , battlefield areas situated east of the capital , where the resistance against them was firm and tenacious .  
The Commission came to the unequivocal conclusion that Iraq had in fact produced biological weapons , that its biological programme was offensive in nature , that Al Hakam had been constructed as a dedicated biological warfare agent research and production facility and had been operational before January 1991 , and that additional sites , including Muthanna , a known chemical weapons establishment , were involved in the programme .  
The destruction of large chemical weapons stocks and of the sprawling biological weapons facility at Al Hakam , the neutralization of wide-ranging and diverse missile capabilities as well as the creation of a unique and effective monitoring and verification system are tangible examples of accomplishments over five and a half years .  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gasses , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 1 ] / as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
The issue involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment .  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Adopting effective controls on explosives and against illicit trafficking by criminals in certain materials and their components that are specifically designed for use in manufacturing nuclear , biological or chemical weapons and , in order to lessen risks arising from such trafficking , by becoming party to and fully implementing all relevant international treaties relating to weapons of mass destruction ;  
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 49 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
A general definition of the activities covered , as contained in article 1 , was satisfactory , since it would be difficult to list all the activities and substances to which the articles applied , not least because of the constant advances of science and the concomitant increase in lawful activities ; and also because of the need progressively to eliminate certain chemical substances deemed to be harmful to the environment and to prohibit certain activities that were currently lawful , such as deforestation .  
The substantive outcome of these joint efforts relates in particular to environmental protection in its global dimension : prohibiting chemical and bacteriological weapons and reducing nuclear weapons , as well as formulating a new concept and practice of peacekeeping ; ensuring human rights ; and codifying international law on non-renewable resources .  
We once again call upon all relevant parties to manifest the requisite political will and flexibility in the Preparatory Commission so that the major remaining issues concerning abandoned chemical weapons , challenge inspections and article XI can be properly resolved before the entry into force of the Convention .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
The highest priority for the international community , therefore , should continue to remain the ultimate and complete elimination of nuclear weapons as was laid down in the Final Document of SSOD I . The agenda should also include measures on the elimination of the other weapons of mass destruction , in particular chemical and biological weapons , through the full implementation of relevant disarmament treaties . 
Recalling the long-standing determination of the international community to achieve the effective prohibition of the development , production , stockpiling and use of chemical and biological weapons as well as the continuing support for measures to uphold the authority of the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating , Poisonous or Other Gases , and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare , signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925 , [ 48 ] as expressed by consensus in many previous resolutions ,  
With the aim of integrating and consolidating national and international efforts to promote chemical safety , the Forum is to provide policy guidance , develop strategies in a coordinated and integrated manner , foster understanding of the issues , and promote the requested policy support needed to discharge those functions .  
Although there have certainly been some unfulfilled expectations in addressing the global chemicals agenda , these two mechanisms are demonstrating that , by acting in close cooperation , bodies engaged in chemical safety work can be more productive and attain higher quality results from a given level of effort and resources .  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
During the last two years only , the inspections have led to the unmasking of : a complete biological weapons development and production programme ; highly sophisticated and advanced work on the extremely lethal chemical warfare nerve agent VX ; and the multifaceted domestic development and production of Scud-type missile engines under Iraq 's project 1728 .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
After peaceful relations and reconciliation are established among all States in the region , Israel will endeavour to establish in the Middle East _ through direct negotiations among all its members _ a zone free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons , as well as ballistic missiles , based on mutual and effective verification .  
Indeed , Israel has been actively supporting and participating in efforts of the international community to prevent the proliferation of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles , not least through export control mechanisms , inspired by those of the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) , the Australian Group ( AG ) , and the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) , of which Israel is an adherent .  
As the tensions which reflected the cold war era give way to growing global confidence and cooperation , the international community should now turn more of its attention and energies towards many as yet unresolved regional conflicts , which are characterized by unprecedented conventional arms build _ ups and , in some instances , also by the Clandestine pursuit of nuclear , chemical or biological weapons .  
Promising directions of cooperation of development of cooperative links in the mining and metallurgical , chemical and jewellery industries and light industry , mechanical engineering , building materials production , military industrial complexes and agro-industry complexes ; the establishment of inter-State industrial and financial groups and joint enterprises ; cooperation between transport department ; harmonization of the actions of the banking systems of Armenia and the Russian Federation ; and other joint actions taken in the light of the mutual economic interests of the two countries .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
It stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , the prohibition of the development of outer space weapons , and the reduction of conventional weapons to a rational level .  
My country , Senegal , feels that , apart from the potential for destruction presented by nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , security problems are equally linked to conventional armaments in numerous conflicts and tensions raging throughout the world , especially in Africa .  
Within this framework , the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms must , if it is to be successful , be expanded to include information on other categories of armaments that are not currently covered , such as nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , in addition to advanced technology with military applications .  
The Movement observed that in his note the Secretary-General expressed the view that weapons of mass destruction continued to be of primary importance despite significant progress achieved to outlaw chemical and biological weapons and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regimes .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
After the establishment , as we hope , of peace treaties between Israel and every country of the region , it will be possible to create a regional security system that would provide multilateral and shared solutions to the range of security problems in the Middle East , including a mutually and effectively verifiable Middle East free of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles .  
The application of double standards in the area of non-proliferation and the employment of non-transparent and exclusive export control mechanisms in the areas of nuclear , chemical and biological technology for peaceful uses are most destructive of international confidence and security .  
That will be possible only if the Security Council shoulders its full legal and political responsibilities : to defend its resolutions without applying double standards , especially since Israel , as we all know , continues to possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical weapons , that pose a threat to regional and international peace and security .  
Given that many countries , particularly in the developing world , lack adequate institutional capacity in hazardous waste management and in monitoring illegal imports of chemical and hazardous wastes , there is an urgent need for strengthening national capacity for the effective management of such wastes .  
My Government is fully confident that , provided there is political will , tangible action addressing conventional weapons would not be beyond the scope either of the ability or the competence of a forum that has to its credit the successful negotiation of bans on whole categories of weapons of mass destruction , including biological and chemical weapons .  
Many representatives noted that the topic involved mainly activities typical of modern industrial societies , such as those connected with nuclear power plants , the chemical and space industries and maritime transport of petroleum and other dangerous or polluting substances , which certainly had undeniable political and economic value , but also posed a considerable risk for the safety of human beings and protection of the environment . 
Turkey considered that such a convention should also include organized transnational crimes committed in the perpetration of or linked to terrorist acts and illicit trafficking in firearms , in chemical and nuclear materials and in children and other persons .  24 .  The United States noted that Member States had not had sufficient time to discuss the question of the elaboration of an international convention against organized crime and to exchange their views on the issue .  
As in most developed-country markets , there are regulations which specify the types of packs that are acceptable and the information that labels must contain , and health regulations which are often justified both in terms of hygienic conditions and the use of harmful chemical additives , pesticides and fertilizers , but which can be so complicated and restrictive that they act as barriers for developing country suppliers .  
The use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel-air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium , like the dumping of other toxic and dangerous chemicals and wastes in the developing countries , violates the rights to life , health , physical security and other human rights , such as economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development .  
In the Middle East , the Palestinian people and the Arab population in the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley continue to face serious environmental dangers as a result of the continued Israeli occupation of their territories and the growing military threat posed by nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons .  
Recalling further its resolution 1996 / 16 , in which it requested the Secretary _ General to submit a report on information gathered on the use of nuclear weapons , chemical weapons , fuel _ air bombs , napalm , cluster bombs , biological weaponry and weaponry containing depleted uranium and their consequential and cumulative effects and the danger they represent to life , physical security and other human rights ,  
The Organization coordinates the environmental monitoring activities and scientific assessments of its 178 Member states and 5 territories through its Global Atmosphere Watch ( GAW ) , a system of networks of observing stations , related facilities , and infrastructure encompassing the measurement and related scientific assessment activities devoted to the investigation of the changing chemical composition and related physical characteristics of the global atmosphere . 
With water a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , the imperative remains to manage all freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality within minimum acceptable standards .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
The potential hazard of radioactive material depends upon : the type of material ( i.e . , plutonium , uranium , thorium ) ; isotopic composition ( i.e . , content of fissile isotopes ) ; physical and chemical form ; degree of dilution ; radiation level ; and quantity .  
In that case , Iraq had refused to accede to a request by a chief inspector to be furnished with a copy of a document highly pertinent to obtaining a verifiable material balance of Iraq 's munitions filled with chemical or biological agents .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
Within the framework of the WHO project , implemented in three stages , national specialists have been undergoing training , both abroad and in-country ; laboratories for analyses have been set up in provinces and towns ; and the necessary equipment , instruments , chemical substances and diagnostic devices for analysis have been supplied to urban and rural areas .  
Stress the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
In view of the fact that the two types of weapons of mass destruction of biological and chemical weapons have been comprehensively prohibited , there is no reason why nuclear weapons , which are of greater destructive force , should not be comprehensively banned and thoroughly destroyed .  
The readiness demonstrated by the Arab States to take practical steps towards the establishment of an effectively verifiable Middle East zone free from all weapons of mass destruction - nuclear , chemical and biological - and to refrain from taking any measures that preclude the achievement of this objective in accordance with paragraph 5 of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East as well as paragraph 14 of Security Council resolution 687 ( 1991 ) should not go unnoticed .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
Damage to oil refineries , fuel dumps and chemical and fertilizer factories , as well as the toxic smoke from huge fires and the leakage of harmful chemicals into the soil and the water table have contributed to as yet unassessed levels of environmental pollution in some urban areas , which may in turn have a negative impact on health and ecological systems .  
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
Sectors that have been the main targets for recent anti-dumping actions are metals and metal products , chemical products , machinery and electrical equipment , plastics and plastic products , textiles and clothing , pulp of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material , prepared foodstuffs and beverages , stone and plaster products , other manufactured products , footwear and headgear .  
When the shell hits its target , normally a tank or an armoured car , it emits chemical and radioactive dust containing carcinogenic ionized atoms ( alpha-gamma ) that not only contaminates the area around the incinerated tank but is carried great distances on the wind and spread over a wide area , contaminating the air , soil , vegetation and human beings .  
In its fourth area of concentration , the UNEP approach , which emphasized the need for cleaner production , changing consumption patterns and the potential risk of chemical products , was based on the belief that the international community must stimulate the development of environmentally friendly technologies .  
Stresses the value both of the collection of reliable oceanographic data through such systems as the Global Ocean Observing System , including the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network , and of periodic comprehensive scientific assessments of international waters , such as the Global International Waters Assessment , including assessments of the impact of physical and chemical changes on the health , distribution and productivity of living marine resources .  
That region has suffered from brutal and savage conflicts for many years , most recently Iraq ' s wanton and brutal invasion of Kuwait , and the continuous threat to neighbouring countries posed by the Iraqi regime ' s use of chemical and biological weapons against its own people in northern Iraq .  
The Russian Federation has made progress in putting together a comprehensive programme for destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , including the identification of destruction sites , the technology needed for destruction , protection of the environment , the agencies responsible and the overall financial requirements , which has been approved by President Yeltsin . A draft law , which will establish the legal framework for destruction , has received its first hearing in the Duma .  
What the Convention will do is create a system that makes that extremely difficult as a practical matter , because of its system of monitoring sensitive chemicals , its challenge inspection provisions , its economic and political sanctions , and by creating a forum for determining collective action to combat the threat of chemical weapons .  
While control over the regulation of all aspects of the production and supply of drugs and psychotropic substances had been tightened in health care and scientific institutions and in the chemical industry , severely weakened institutional accountability , as well as an underdeveloped system for formulating and implementing regulations impeded control and oversight .  
In fifth place , as regards general disarmament , we emphasize the need to advance towards total elimination of nuclear , chemical and bacteriological weapons ; illicit trafficking in small arms , and the use of antipersonnel mines and explosive devices .  
It still dumps nuclear waste in the occupied Arab territories and continues its programme of developing all kinds of weapons of mass destruction , biological or chemical , because of the worlds inaction and the double standards that the great Powers apply .  
Our efforts in biological and chemical weapons , in verifying conventional arms levels and in pursuing collective security arrangements are all an essential backdrop to creating the conditions for complete nuclear disarmament .  
With water as a primary agent in maintaining both human health and transmitting disease , there is an imperative need to manage land and freshwater sources to maintain chemical and biological quality to minimum acceptable standards .  
All missiles capable of carrying warheads with nuclear , bacteriological and chemical agents should be banned from future production and current stockpiles should be gradually reduced and finally destroyed .  
Sanctions should be restricted to the acquisition of arms , military equipment and dual-use materials as stipulated in relevant Security Council resolutions , especially the resolutions relating to the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , be they nuclear , chemical or biological , and of any other military potential that might endanger the sovereignty , safety , security and stability of neighbouring countries .  
With regard to the use of non-controlled substitute chemicals in the illicit manufacture of drugs , the substances and guidelines included in the limited international special surveillance list established by the Board were a useful tool for Governments , promoting awareness and cooperation with the chemical industry to prevent diversion of those substances .  
Urges Governments and international and regional organizations to make every effort to enhance cooperation at all levels , with all relevant agencies and with the chemical industry and trade , to ensure the rapid exchange of information , in particular relating to stopped shipments , suspicious transactions and new chemicals identified as being used in the illicit manufacture of drugs ;  
The aim of the Recommendations for Guidance is to define the biological , chemical , geological and physical components to be measured and the procedures to be followed by the Contractor to ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects which may arise from its activities in the Area , and to provide guidance to prospective contractors in preparing plans of work for exploration for polymetallic nodules .  
Quality of life is declining in urban areas , with losses of housing and of human lives caused by erosion , siltation and flooding ; general insalubrity owing to the lack of appropriate solid and liquid waste management systems ; severe overcrowding caused both by the population explosion and by uncontrollable concentrations of population ; physical and chemical degradation of land ; pollution of all kinds ; and above all , deforestation on the periphery of urban areas . 
It is our hope that the country concerned will work out a comprehensive and practical destruction programme as soon as possible in accordance with its obligations under the Convention , which should guarantee the safety of the local people and the environment so that the substantive destruction process can be started and the grave danger posed by the abandoned chemical weapons can be eliminated within the time frame set forth in the Convention .  
The full implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention must be seen as an urgent endeavour of the international community with a view to eliminating all chemical arsenals , verifying industrial activities using sensitive chemicals , promoting increasing cooperation for peaceful uses , and controlling the international exchange of sensitive chemicals , a task entrusted to the OPCW but regrettably not yet implemented despite the wish of the majority of States parties .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
These include : the conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty ( CTBT ) ; the indefinite extension of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ( NPT ) ; the encouraging decisions taken at the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the NPT ; the adoption of the Convention banning chemical weapons ; and the recent adoption of the Programme of Action to combat the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons .  But it is most disappointing to note that several multilateral disarmament initiatives have remained unrealized or face an uncertain future .  
The international community continues to witness an accelerated race to develop strategic nuclear reactors for military purposes and increase the range and power of ballistic missiles and rockets with nuclear , chemical and biological warheads despite the pledges of the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit last year for , among other things , the gradual multilateral reduction of arsenals of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction .  
We note with the deepest concern the close connections between international terrorism and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other deadly materials , as a paramount threat to international peace and security at the dawn of the new millennium .  
Accordingly , the political reality in our region mandates a practical step-by-step approach , culminating in a comprehensive peace and the eventual establishment of a mutually verifiable zone free of ballistic missiles and of chemical , biological and nuclear weapons .  
Our close cooperation becomes urgent when it is realized that a small group of terrorists can actually possess weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , biological and chemical ones , and destroy large areas of the world and millions of innocent people with wilful abandon , senselessly and indiscriminately .  
Recognizing further the close connection between international terrorism and illicit arms-trafficking and the illegal movement of nuclear , chemical , biological and other potentially deadly materials ,
