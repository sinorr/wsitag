Today , the curtains of a large-scale development of the country 's western region have already been raised , and the enthusiasm of the vast numbers of cadres and masses is running high .

Hosts of facts proved that through fabricating a set of heresies , Li Hongzhi absorbed and controlled spiritually a great number of kindhearted people who want to keep themselves strong and healthy .

I believe that a healthy , stable , and friendly relationship between China and India is in the common interests of the peoples of the two countries and is also conducive to the global peace and stability .  The Sino-Indian friendship , diligently cultivated by the leaders of the two countries , will certainly continue advancing forward in the new century .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .

In light of the existing problems of the national economy and policies for the future , a concerned authoritative person said : At present , the problems in the deeper level of economic operation still have not been fundamentally solved , the effective demand is still inadequate , and the delay in the adjustment of the economic structure and other " stubborn problems " still obstruct the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
In recent years Comrade Jiang Zemin has repeatedly emphasized that leading cadres must stress study , politics , and healthy trends , work hard to enhance the ideological and political quality of the ranks of party members and cadres , do a good job in resolving problems of world view , view of life , and values , and firmly embrace correct ideals and beliefs .  
The number one men of the party and government occupy the key position in the leadership groups and shoulder heavy responsibilities ; if supervision over them is lost , they will become privileged figures without control or constraint , which will result in suggestions being stifled , criticism being suppressed , and healthy trends suffering setbacks , and it will be impossible to curb the phenomena of corruption .  
In short , we must , under the unified leadership of party committees at all levels , carry out vigorous ideological-political work to explain and answer the masses ' questions , resolve contradictions , straighten out their feelings , coordinate interest relationship , bring about cohesion , and mobilize all positive factors .  Only by so doing can we provide our country 's reform , opening up , and modernization with powerful spiritual motive force and ideological safeguards ; can our economic construction advance in a healthy and smooth way .  
To study and implement the spirit of " the Speech , " we should create a healthy , progressive , scientific , and civilized social and culture environment which will guarantee that our youngsters can develop healthily .  Adolescence is a period when youngsters are developing their outlooks on the world and life as well as their value systems .  The quality of social environment is of utmost importance to them .  
All quarters of society and educational departments should make concerted efforts to strengthen the comprehensive management of society and cultural development ; should air more selected radio and television programs , show more selected movies , and publish more selected books and journals that are beneficial to the youngters ' healthy growth so as to resolutely resist the poisoning of youngsters by various feudal superstitions and decadent ideas and cultures ;  
They should rectify and improve public order inside and around schools and sternly crack down on various illegal and criminal activities that jeopardize the normal order in school and should strengthen community development and actively create a harmonious environment in families and neighborhoods to conscientiously guarantee the youngsters ' healthy growth .  
Meanwhile , we should also uphold the principle of suiting measures to local conditions and providing specific guidance for work in specific areas ; push forward the work in a positive and steady manner by means of taking cases of excellence as an example for the rest to follow , and by means of using the experience of selected units to promote work in the entire area ; and bring about a healthy and orderly development to the socialization of social welfare .  
In short , the economic globalization trend and China 's reform and opening up have provided guarantee that the capital adequacy ratio reaches its standard , which is not only the rule of game for the international banking industry , but also the internal demand for the development of a socialist market economy and the promotion of the healthy growth of the banking industry in China .  
It should be said that the participation of non-state-owned shares in the capital will help the large-sized commercial banks ascertain their operational objectives , resist administrative intervention , change the traditional non-marketized operations formed in the state-owned commercial banks for many years by means of the shareholders ' interest mechanism and supervisory and restraining mechanism such as auditing supervision and so on , and promote the healthy development of the economy and the banking industry .  
In the economic field , we are faced with two major topics that should be solved properly .  One is to establish a relatively perfect socialist market economic structure and the other is to maintain the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
With the unchecked spread of large quantities of pirated publications riddled with errors , a lot of wrong knowledge and information is misleading the consumers in a very harmful manner .  Youngsters in particular would be adversely affected for life by such wrong knowledge .  Certain obscene pirated CDs would even directly interfere with youngsters ' healthy growth .  
We should sing aloud the " Collection of Morality Songs for Military Personnel " to enable these songs that are revolutionary , advanced , healthy and progressive to echo in military camps , to enrich our lives , to inspire our spirit , to serve our strengthening and accelerating our military 's fighting strength , to serve our strengthening and improving ideological and political work , and to serve our constructing a socialist spiritual civilization .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .
