Especially in recent years , with continued enhancement of using technology in the weaponry and constant introduction of high new technology , the traditional " men of unusual strength " and " fleet-footed runners " are no longer the tops in training of the missile company .  To replace them are the " software fans " capable of planning and managing commands from the commanding center by softly clicking the mouse in front of the computer screen and the " computer experts " skilled in using software to launch missiles .  
In order to change this situation , the developed countries , which have benefited most in the course of economic globalization and have possessed a huge amount of capital and advanced technologies , are totally capable of providing more development aid to developing countries .  
He said that although Ningxia is situated inland and its natural conditions are not excellent , its ancient irrigation works , splendid Xixia civilization , and unique customs and cultures are wholly capable of attracting tourists at home and abroad to bring along local economic developments .  
To enterprises , it is far from enough if they merely have the general knowledge of the WTO 's basic rules .  Hence , it is necessary to adopt multiple forms to train , as quickly as possible , a large number of special personnel who are familiar with the WTO rules , proficient in foreign languages , and capable of participating in the settlement of trade disputes .  
5 ) After 21 years of rapid growth , China 's comprehensive national strength has been remarkably augmented , the eastern region has possessed considerable actual strength , and the central and western regions have basically resolved the problem of having enough to eat and wear , thus the state and the eastern region are capable of increasing the intensity of rendering support to the central and western development .  
Early this year , in formulating plans for advanced scientific and technological training , leading members of the subdistrict held that the future advanced scientific and technological war would mainly be a theater battle .  The reserve forces and militiamen must be capable of providing highly efficient and swift logistical supply and give full play to their role of protecting the theater of war .

The society is unceasingly progressing , the economy is rapidly developing , the living standard of the people is increasing day by day , and Turkey has already become a spectacular country in the international community .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
Foreign army materials show that the Russian Army recently formulated a basic concept for developing a command system at the current stage .  An important aspect was cutting back and readjusting fixed command facilities and building a field campaign command center equipped with various functions and capable of rapid response .  
As the new model aircraft had very powerful mechanical functions and was installed with video camera and laser display equipment , it was capable of appraising the tactics and firepower response of the artillery unit .  It also had the function of simulated missile launch , thereby creating conditions for raising the quality of training in " three attacks and three defenses . "  
Because of limited resources for scientific research , relatively obsolete equipment , and shortage of capable innovators , we must uphold the policy of carrying out innovations selectively , stress the principal needs , and accurately select the areas where we will make the breakthroughs so that we can use the limited resources on innovative research projects .  With respect to innovative scientific research , we should realize that , while we are falling behind developed countries , we should have confidence in our own strength , which is more important .  
Since the end of the Cold War , in order to maintain its leading position as " the only superpower capable of lording it over " , the United States has gradually cultivated a global strategy such as " controlling two oceans and striking from both sides " in light of a new international strategic pattern .  
In May 1999 , it again launched the " month of recommendation for skilled persons " activities .  It had tried to recruit skilled people from all parts of the country by lifting geographic restrictions and ignoring the applicant 's social status .  From more than 500 outstanding young party and government cadres and over 500 excellent young managers in various enterprises under the direct administration of the city , it had selected 100 young administrators capable of working in large enterprise groups .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
The key cities of people 's air-defense across the country have generally established an air-raid siren test system , formulated and improved urban air-defense plan , and strengthened the people 's air-defense command system .  Various localities have organized and trained a total of several hundred-thousand air-defense workers specialized in dealing with the aftermath of air-raid , and thus created a backbone force capable of performing air-defense task in wartime and the task of disaster control in peacetime .  
Over the past several years , the unit has trained an outstanding contingent of professional backbone personnel for sea transportation ; has become capable of fulfilling sea transportation tasks under all sorts of complex conditions ; and has successfully accomplished sea training or sea support tasks on countless occasions .  
The United States also believes that , looking at the balance of forces in the Asia-Pacific region , the western forces headed by itself are overwhelmingly superior , and so the present moment is an excellent opportunity for establishing a constraining multilateral security mechanism under its own control , capable of resolving substantive problems .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
Some anti-chemical warfare equipment with high technological content have been successively developed and produced .

Now , China 's ground telemetry stations and its telemetry ships at sea constitute a complete aerospace telemetry network for the boundless outer space .  They can accomplish the telemetry mission for various kinds of satellites and spacecraft .  China 's telemetry technology has reached the world 's advanced level , and China is capable of sharing telemetry resources with international networks .  
Japan recently published its " Medium-term Reorganization and Equipment Plan for the Defense Force for 2001-2005 . "  It is not difficult to see from this that , to fit in with its strategic goal of becoming a major political power , Japan is now making efforts to develop in the direction of becoming a strong military power , and will build the Japanese Self-defense Force into a new defense force with stronger capability , faster reaction , and more capable of dealing with " peripheral events . "  
in order to meet the need of maneuver of heavily equipped mass target under the condition of modern warfare , the unit has developed a group of capable personnel , equipment capable of guarding against infrared rays , and a series of thermal imaging camouflage equipment ;  
Equipped with such a portable tent , a patrol or inspection team is capable of taking a rest or staying in an area at any time , should it fail to reach a destination in time or encounter bad weather , and this has also enhanced the regiment 's control over some key areas or sandy areas , to which access is difficult .  
In just three weeks after President Bush entered the White House , he was anxious to increase military spending again .  The objective is to make the United States , which presently holds the largest store of nuclear weapons and the world 's most advanced and strongest standing military , always capable of maintaining its absolute military dominance , as well as further distance itself from all other major countries ' military capacity and consolidating the US position as the world 's " only superpower " .  
The Clinton administration proposed a limited defense system which was confined to a land-based deployment .  According to the plan , a system composed of 100 interceptors would be built inside the country which was capable of dealing with about 20-30 attacking ballistic missiles .  There was no plan to build up a system of a larger scale .  
Reality shows that the third-generation leading collective of the Central Party Committee led by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a sophisticated leading core which is completely capable of mastering any kind of complicated situation and which carries the hopes of the Party and the nation on its shoulders .  Without such a solid leading collective , our nation would not be able to enjoy the current auspicious conditions .  
They upheld selecting the best of the best to correctly select and assign capable commanding officers for brigades and regiments , adopted various patterns to strengthen the training for the leading organs of brigades and regiments , implemented patterns like armies and divisions working together , members of party standing committees having division of labor , and so on to examine and assist the building of brigades and regiments one by one , and unfolded the activities of appraising through comparison the advanced brigades and regiments to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of brigades and regiments .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
They should also be introduced if they meet relevant requirements .  In short , capable personnel are the basic conditions for doing any work .  As long as the recruitment of such capable personnel is conducive to the building of national defense and to the modernization of our armed forces , we should strive to recruit them without sticking to one pattern .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
On 9 May 2000 , USAF Chief of Staff and Commander jointly published a white paper , entitled Aerospace Force : Defending America in the 21st Century , which emphasized again that the Air Force should be developed from a force trained primarily for air battles into an " aeronautic and astronautic integrated " air force , or aerospace force , capable of fighting both air and space battles .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
The key reason is that the plane is equipped with some expensive and most advanced wide-band and fully digitized receivers instead of ordinary electronic surveillance equipment , and its all-frequency and all-band receivers are capable of intercepting or monitoring signals transmitted by the Chinese Communist forces through all frequencies .  
Said Zhang Wenzhong , political commissar of this institute : After the incident occurred , our government and people waged a firm struggle against the hegemonic ways of the United States and forced the US Government to change its initial tough and unreasonable attitude and to apologize to the Chinese people .  This once again shows that the party center with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core is farsighted , good at strategizing , and capable of keeping various kinds of complicated situation under control and dealing with complex issues .  
Therefore , to ensure that our contingent of army cadres is on the mark politically is the top priority for upholding the principle of the party 's absolute leadership over the army , which has a direct bearing on the prosperity or decline and success or failure of the party 's cause , the prolonged peace and stability of the country , and the overall requirement that the army is " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  
lay emphasis on the requirements for stressing political awareness , having a good understanding of science and technology , and doing official duties honestly so that our cadres are " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  In particular , we need to put the political criteria in the first place in order to judge whether our cadres have firm ideal and faith and can seek unity ideologically and politically with the party 's central committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  
It is especially necessary to take effective policy measures to build and develop a contingent of high-level personnel and versatile personnel who can meet the needs of the new period , with the focus on training and absorbing capable personnel for making innovations , management and operation and on further creating a favorable environment for capable personnel who have returned from studying abroad to do pioneering work .  
In order to firmly adhere to the policy of dealing " sure , accurate and relentless " blows to criminals , procuratorial and public security organizations in Chongqing and Changde made prompt preparations even in the investigation period .  Those organizations assigned key and capable personnel to investigate and detect cases in several provinces .  Public security organizations also quickly handed over cases to procuratorial organizations .  
We must strengthen our building of leadership teams , keep our objectives firmly in mind , strengthen Party spirit , consider the situation as a whole , unite closely , fulfill promises , strive to implement the Party line , have an effective and strong ideological level , political awareness and professional capability , building a strong leadership collective capable of bearing its historical responsibility .

Those ranked at the second level are chivalrous experts .  They are the " middle-aged mainstay " in the world of hackers .  They are mature and stable in terms of their technological standard , and capable of independently handling more complicated situations .  Moreover , since they are the ones who give demonstrations and guidance to novices , they are considered the " high production units " in the operation .  
All these " precedents " set by the certain air force aviation regiment - - each of which is worthy of being recorded in the development history of the people 's air force - - show to the people : In future wars , the regiment will definitely be a " formidable sword in the vast sky " capable of both attacking and defending and of smashing any fortifications .  
The basis for the economic expert 's judgment is that the principal administrator is formulating policies on " political correctness . "  As a result , professional bureaucrats have lost their functions , the capable people have remained silent , and those who curry favor with the authorities for personal gain have followed the direction where the wind blows , thus resulting in corrupt political practice .  
We have made brilliant achievements in aiding and developing poverty-stricken areas , however , we should be aware that the production means and living in the poor areas have not yet been basically improved .  These poor areas are hardly capable of resisting natural disasters , their levels of production and social growth are comparatively low , and the gap between them and coastal developed areas keeps expanding .  
There are 21 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities that have formulated rules and regulations on the study and application of laws among the leading cadres , and have clearly defined that whether a cadre possesses necessary legal knowledge and whether he is capable of managing affairs strictly according to law should be taken as a major content for the assessment of his work performance .  
This essential character requires that military personnel of the new type should not only become military experts , but also be politically minded , politically sensitive , highly capable of making distinctions on political issues , firm in adhering to ideals and convictions , and pure ideologically and morally .  
The above two different early warning systems are known as " the air-based early warning system " and " the ground-based air target surveillance and tracking system " , respectively , with the former is formed mainly by the DSP satellite system , which is capable of sounding an early warning against an incoming missile , or its future replacement - - " the air-based infrared surveillance system " , and the latter by seven key early warning systems operated by the US Air Force Space Command and the US Navy Space Command , respectively . 
The SBIRS system is a new-generation satellite monitoring network being developed by the United States at the moment , for the purpose of locating and tracking an incoming missile , and the system is capable of processing a growing volume of data collected by four infrared air surveillance systems ( the system of early warning against an incoming missile , the missile defense system , the technological intelligence gathering system , and the system of identifying features of a battle zone ) .
