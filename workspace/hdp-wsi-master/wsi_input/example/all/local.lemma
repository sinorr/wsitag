I think that the development of foreign trade in the central and western regions must be combined with the local advantages , take the international markets as their orientation , make best use of their advantages , bypass their disadvantages , exploit their favorable conditions to the full , and form their own unique features .  
In my opinion , to make breakthroughs and attain greater development in absorbing foreign capital , the central and western regions must not simplistically copy the policies of the eastern region .  Instead , they must display their own advantages according to local conditions , bring forth new ideas , adopt new models and more effective measures , and open even wider to the outside world .  
and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .

The central government has put an end to its past practice of uniform and direct central management and control by allowing various localities and departments to adopt flexible or varied production or operation modes ; has called for developing a superior economy by suiting measures to the local conditions or opportunities ; has urged all sectors to carry out economic accounting and ensure economic efficiency ;  
Finally , the " Opinion " calls on local people 's governments at all levels and the departments concerned to make overall plans for developing social welfare undertakings , set reasonable work targets , and avoid such practices as acting arbitrarily , rushing headlong into mass action , making overlapping efforts , and wasting resources .

On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
It is absurd , because it regards a local government within a country of sovereignty and territorial integrity as an " independent state . "  This is nothing short of challenging and illegally plundering the fundamental interests of all the people of the country .  
Regional conflicts and local wars have broken out one after another .  There is not yet a fundamental change in the unfair and inequitable old international political and economic order .  
The success of the exercise fully reflected the great achievements of the air force logistics system in seriously implementing Chairman Jiang Zemin 's strategic thinking on strengthening the army through science and technology , persisting in taking as their goal winning a high-tech local war , and actively launching mass science and technology training , closely centering on the focal and difficult points in logistics in actual combat .  
The Israeli Volunteers Service Center is a unique social service institution based on local communities .  It is managed by volunteers and provide family health and medical care for the aging , weak , sick , and disabled people .  It is also the largest volunteer organization in Israel .  
Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .

Zhu Rongji stated that the State Council is going to organize a special force and , once an in-depth investigative study is completed , propose a plan for improving the social security system at the end of the year .  Once it is approved by the central authorities , it may be implemented on a trial basis in Liaoning first , while the other provinces and regions may select one or two local places and cities to implement pilot projects , promoting it comprehensively once we have obtained some experience .  
Meanwhile , we should also uphold the principle of suiting measures to local conditions and providing specific guidance for work in specific areas ; push forward the work in a positive and steady manner by means of taking cases of excellence as an example for the rest to follow , and by means of using the experience of selected units to promote work in the entire area ; and bring about a healthy and orderly development to the socialization of social welfare .

In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
With the great support of the local port administration and experts concerned , this reserve division has researched and built a roll-on connecting bridge , thus opening up a passageway for the troops to load and unload their heavy equipment on sea .  This division has received favorable comment from the troops participating in the drill .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
Bearing in mind Dandong 's key antichemical warfare work targets , the antichemical warfare detachment of the local troops conducted the exploratory drill to counter possible direct or indirect use of chemical weapons by the enemy in future warfare .  
The restriction on projects on which restriction must be imposed can also be appropriately relaxed so long as such projects are conducive to the development of the western region and do not affect local environmental protection or the overall situation of national economic construction .  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned is an important component of the efforts that the local party committees should make to maintain , reinforce , and improve the party 's leadership .  Only by continuously improving itself , and making efforts to improve the mode of its leadership , can a local party committee really ascent a higher plain to look farther ahead and give thought to things more deeply ; and only thus can it better play a role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level .

In local war , one strictly selects military and non-military targets and employs the most accurate and " humane " attack .  This tactic itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .  
The main cause is the intervention of local protectionism and other non-market factors , which have enabled some home electrical appliance enterprises which have lost their competitiveness and survival ability to survive and keep on operating under the protective umbrella of administrative intervention , which , in turn , has prevented resources that have been excessively invested in this industry from smoothly withdrawing from competition .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .

Originally he planned on staying a night in the United States and expanding his impetus and influence and gaining political capital by publicly meeting US pro-Taiwan congressmen and local overseas Chinese ; the United States , however , was worried that it would get into a deadlock with China , and stressed that during his stopover the new leader " can not have any public agenda " .  
Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should help military cadres ' families who were laid off because their enterprises gone bankrupt or suspended production .  Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should follow relevant policies and regulations to protect their basic livelihood condition .  Meanwhile , they should provide them with free professional guidance at least once in a year and free employment recommendation three times a year .  
For military cadres ' families who can not find employment for reasons other than personal one , labor and social security departments can allow them to pay , on a voluntary basis , basic pension insurance fees in accordance with a ratio based on local average wage .  Their pension insurance records can be kept at local employment service organizations .  In addition , they can enjoy exemption or reduction of various management fees .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
We should seize the opportunity , meet challenges , lay stress on the key points , suit our measures to local conditions , grasp the key link and principal contradiction , concentrate our efforts on solving outstanding problems concerning the overall situation in the development of the region , and speed up the region 's economic and social development .  
There will be 4% growth in total local productivity ; at the same time , the government of the special administrative region is trying to improve the investment environment progressively and trying to make the economic rules better and more complete .

All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .

State-owned enterprises in cities must transfer all primary and secondary schools , hospitals , and other social service organizations to unified planning and management by local governments .  For some time , funding needed for this purpose will be jointly shared by both the enterprise and the government before it is gradually transferred in its entirety to the government .  Some of the organizations can be transformed into commercial operations .  
It was reported that the circulation line of US nuclear attack submarine has the problem of metal embrittlement and so it has been criticized by the people .  If nuclear submarines are reinforced in Japan , local people are expected to show objections .  Therefore , Guam has become the best choice of the US military .  
In the political sphere described by Putin as the " crux of Russia 's rejuvenation , " Russia has , by means of the Federal Constitution , straightened out the relations between the central authorities and various republics , oblasts , and border regions ; curbed the separatist tendency of local regimes ; and severely cracked down on the separatist attempt by illegal armed groups in Chechenya , initially restoring a powerful state power system .  
Power struggle between local officials , plenipotentiaries directly commissioned by the President to federate regions , and central administrative institutions may arise from time to time .  In particular , the establishment of peace in Chechenya and the shaping of its future will remain a longstanding headache for Russia .  
Under the leadership of local party committee and government and with the support of the broad masses of the people , public security organs at various places have carried forward the spirit of brave fight and persistent battle , hit hard , moved toward a good beginning of the special target struggle on " hitting the mob and eliminating devils , " and obtained preliminary results .

In compliance with the trend in history and by giving account to Hong Kong 's situation and interests , the central authorities set forth the important principles of " one country , two systems , " " Hong Kong being governed by local people , " and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong .

Over the past few years , the public security organs have adopted resolute measures to " strike at triad activities or weed out local tyrants ; " have ruthlessly cracked down on all types of illegal or criminal activities by cracking one batch of major or serious cases after another or rounding up in the net of law one criminal guilty of flagrant crimes after another ; and have thereby upheld justice , deterred crimes , or maintained social stability .

In some places , there are activities of using smuggling and producing fake products as a way to become rich and the dangerous situation of linking crimes of smuggling and manufacturing fake products with local and personal interests .

As elsewhere in Taiwan , land is used to its best advantage in Chuolan . The verdant mountainsides provide a suitable and scenic setting for fruit cultivation and the area 's inherent features - - such as its excellent natural drainage - - are fully exploited by the local farmers .  
Kangshan is famous for a wide variety of local products . The earliest of these were sugar , dyed cloth , wine , oil , pickled cabbage and thin rice flour noodles . Now the three most famous products are honey , mutton and fermented black bean sauce .  
Fresh seafood is arranged in front of Temple Entrance restaurants , where the customers can select their own seafood and have it prepared to their taste . Others may prefer to buy spring rolls , rice cakes , curry or noodle dishes , tempura , or oyster omelets at the smaller stands , and top them off with a dessert of traditional sweets or luscious pre-cut fruits . Keelung , whether by means of bright new public construction or traditional local color , has managed to overcome the original drab appearance caused by its rainy weather .  
The first announcement was a good omen for the Chinese delegates as Lin Hsiu-ling , the female lead in " All the Youthful Days " won the special mass broadcasting award , conferred by local journalists to the year 's most popular and photogenic star .  
They were originally a solid color , but later came to be embellished with illustrations of ancient Chinese relics , art treasures , local scenery or scenes from famous legends . With its unique ticket design , effective sales and credibility , the Chinese national lottery was chosen by the International Lottery Association in 1962 as the finest in the world .  
Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential . In addition , the specter of rising labor costs and tougher international copyright and trademark laws have further intensified the need for local manufacturers to do their own industrial design , marketed under their own labels .  
Later , an incarnation of Chang Hsun came looking for an appropriate site for a temple and settled on Anhsifu . A local official inspected the area and felt that the cave there would produce phoenixes , an omen meaning that someone living in the area was destined to become famous . The phoenixes , therefore , must not be allowed to escape , and the official ordered that a stone pillar be placed on the " phoenix 's wing . "  
People from points south flocked there to do business , making it second only to P'ingtung itself as a commercial center . The town became the central market for farmers to sell their red beans , betel nuts , coconuts , and other local specialities , from where they were sold wholesale to other markets .  
Many importing countries , strapped by foreign debt , pay particularly close attention to the terms and amount proposed by bidders . In 1979 the ROC government established the Export-Import Bank to assist local makers , granting long-term repayment schedules at low interest rates . In addition , should a foreign customer fail to make good on his payments , the bank will reimburse the Chinese firm and take legal action overseas to recover the debt .  
If local people are responsible for some mistake , a foreign administrator had best not make an issue of it in public , or the perceived assault is liable to boomerang as one is labelled a " racist . "  
In the late 1970 ' s the local film scene acquired a new look . The Motion Picture Development Foundation film library , founded in 1978 with the support of the Government Information Office , began to systematically introduce famous European films and top-notch local works to its members . And starting in 1980 , an international film festival has been held every year in conjunction with the Golden Horse Awards to show foreign art films ( together with some high-standard commercial films ) nominated for the awards .  
Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
As a result , all the trivial chores of running an embassy - - showing slides , cooking and serving dinner , fixing toilets , paying the water bills - - have to be handled by the ambassador and one or two assistants , in addition to their major duties of keeping themselves informed of the local situation , negotiating with local officials , and serving overseas nationals .  
The Taiwan Photographic Society , whose motto was realism with a local color , and the Photographic Society of China , whose rallying cry was salon pictorialism , represented the two main streams of photography on Taiwan during the 1960s and 70s . Because of differences in viewpoint , language , and thinking , the two groups moved in different circles of activity and engaged in different spheres of endeavor .  
We should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an even more active and responsible attitude . From central to local government , from representative bodies to the administrative agencies , all should make a thorough self-review , based on actual needs , and strengthen and improve where required , to fortify the substance and function of democracy .  
The materials can be divided into several major categories : chia-ku wen remains ( oracular bone inscriptions ) , ancient artifacts , original editions , government documents from the Ming and Ching dynasties , local records , and modern historical documents .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies . It now is evident that , while the ruling party focused its efforts on central government offices and overlooked the recruitment of candidates that can win in local elections , the DPP has launched its most elite manpower at the local level , especially in races for county magistrates and city mayors .  
Japan 's environmental movement has been joined by doctors , lawyers and experts in various fields who have helped to set up research and legal channels to follow and even to educate the local populace in environmental issues enabling disputes to be resolved within the system and at the same time raising environmental awareness . "  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
Eventually people strung together some of the popular songs existing in the countryside , blending them in with plots from vernacular fiction and song-texts and inserting a few charming stage steps and movements derived from ch'e-ku and ts'ai-ch'a drama . The result was a new type of folk drama with a strong element of local color and the main emphasis on singing .  
Taiwanese folk opera is sung in the vernacular and is easy for the local community to understand . Its affecting stories of lovelorn suffering proved immensely appealing to farmers and fishermen whose simple lives otherwise offered little opportunity for leisure or recreational pastimes .  
If a local can under-take recording and explanatory fieldwork in advance it helps give a better insight into the subject , and the lack of obstacles to communication and understanding makes it easier for him to organize scattered and fragmentary materials and so arrive at more meaningful and detailed results . " This is how Wang Sung-shan , currently a research assistant at the National Science Museum , regards Ch'en Chien-ming 's role vis-a-vis other workers in the field .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
At the end of the Ch'ing , the port became obstructed by silt , and it lost its value as a port . The local center of activity shifted to Chunan . And when the railroad was built , it only stopped at Chunan , further isolating Chungkang .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
Some of the demands overlap with standard government regulations , but even more of them are based on special local needs , such as a requirement that the firm adhere to effluent standards higher than the national standard , that an environmental impact statement be drawn up , that an inspection team be set up , that the factory reach certain standards within a certain period of time or else be shut down .  
Premier Hau Pei-tsun has stated that the government wants to ensure a healthy stock market , not rescue it . The Ministry of Finance has also firmly turned down suggestions from certain deputies and businessmen to lower the securities transaction tax so as to stimulate a recovery in share prices . Instead , regulations are being revised to encourage financially sound companies to list their shares on the market and to allow foreign institutions to enter the market , as a viable means of nudging the local stock market towards full maturity .  
For supplementary legislators , oral interpellations only make up 3% of the total , with 97% being written interpellations . And ten percent of written interpellations are about local affairs , showing that some legislators still have n't settled themselves into being " national level " representatives .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , with people from the various provinces following close behind , the multifarious flavors of north and south China hit the ground running in Taiwan . Add to this the local native style , and you could say that this is the most fortuitous event in the history of Chinese food since somebody figured out how to make fire from rubbing sticks together in ancient times .  
American fast food came to Taiwan in 1984 in the shape of McDonald 's , whose first Taipei outlet achieved a record turnover for the worldwide chain in the first week of opening . They not only encouraged other Western fast food businesses to set up shop here , but also set the pace for local fast food outlets such as Chicken House , Ting Kua Kua and Han Hua , whose common features are based on McDonald 's example of clean , bright surroundings , hygienic food and speedy service with a smile .  
Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized . In recent years , whenever construction projects have posed a threat to those of our kind that are a little on the senior side , or are curiously shaped , local people have stood up on our behalf and tried to save us . All Taiwan heard of the incident where conservationists rallied together to save the towering coconut trees from a road-widening scheme along the Pingtung-to-Kenting Highway .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
Arriving in what were then poor , backward countries such as Nigeria , the Philippines and Indonesia with her Western training and modern medical equipment , she found to her surprise that " age-old local traditional medicine provided the most economical and practical means of care for most people . " And this sparked her interest in studying traditional medicines round the world . "  
Strawberry picking has become a popular leisure activity for city dwellers , and no doubt many people have picked the big red " Taoyuan No . 1 " strawberries at some pick-your-own strawberry farm . This strawberry was developed in Japan and a Japanese patent has been applied for . Local growers also used to carry plants away lock , stock and barrel after they 'd featured in Dutch exhibitions in Taiwan aimed at opening up the local flower market .  
Three years ago she selected a suitably attractive area set against the hills , called Three Corner Lake , and harried the relevant local departments into building an activities center and restaurant there , for the reception of visitors .  
As envisioned at the Council of Agriculture , recreation agriculture in Taiwan will embrace farming , livestock , forestry and fishing in line with the special features of each area . Visitors will get to admire the countryside in its endless seasonal transformation , and have a go at growing rice , picking tea or catching fish . They can also experience local culture in progress , and see temple festivities , open-air performances and prayers for the harvest .  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
The formation of culture is strongly influenced by geographical factors , " says Tsai Hsiang-hui , an associate professor of history at the Chinese Culture University who serves as a trustee to the cultural foundation in Peikang . " The significance of local cultural and educational foundations lies in bringing together people from the same area , sharing similar customs and backgrounds , to show their concern for local culture . If we are n't elementary school classmates , we may be distant cousins .  
Soldiers came from the local brigade to set up a sunscreen , and the electricity company contributed the use of a cherry-pick for pruning the upper branches . Others who lent a hand included farmers , horticulturalists , specialists from the Dept . of Agriculture &amp; Forestry and the National Taiwan University 's department of plant pathology . The offending concrete was removed and the soil changed , with the result that old roots have begun to bud anew , and there seems to be hope for the survival of the tree .  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed . So there are many areas where the military authorities and local government will have to work together in the future .  
D . in soil and agricultural sciences from the University of Hawaii , he returned to Taiwan four years ago . In Taiwan he specialized in recultivation of seeds from rare and precious local varieties of trees . Because he made a major breakthrough in asexual propagation , he had just begun to earn a reputation . Yet it was just at this point that he chose to pull up roots . "  
Three years ago , when first appointed principal of the island 's only junior high , Fuan Junior High School , Lin Yao-wen became deeply enamored of the local scenery , which has been especially favored by nature . The entire family of volcanoes ringing Taipei , including Mt . Tatun , Mt . Chihsing , Mt . Shamao and Mt . Kuanyin , are all visible from the school 's athletic grounds , and the magnificent Keelung River and Tamsui River slowly wind by .  
With a simple and honest look of a farmer , matched with authentic Taiwanese and heavily accented Mandarin , he was extremely effective at using local flavor to add to the persuasiveness of the commercial . "  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
The Chang 's , for instance , who were the first to become foster parents , have become an " instructional boot camp " - - and not just for new foster parents . Since they 're so outgoing and personable , rich in experience and adept at breaking through a child 's " psychological defenses , " Sung Li-hsun often sends children to the Chang 's first so they can see how fostering works and adapt to the local environment before being " parceled out . "  
The salary of a locally born maid is about NT $ 20,000 , while the average for a foreign national is only about NT $ 15,000 , " points out an executive-level professional woman employed in a foreign corporation , who has hired both local and foreign-born help , " and besides , these days only middle aged grannies are willing to work as domestics in Taiwan , and they are very selective themselves , and have a lot of demands like vacation or raises . "  
The " Mei Stream Arts Society , " organized by twelve local Puli painters including Liang Kun-ming and I-yong Hung , has continually held individual and group exhibitions since being established fifteen years ago , and has earned quite a fine reputation in the arts community .  
" Shuishalien : Originally the name of the local aboriginal tribes in the Puli - - sun Moon Lake area ; surrounded on four sides by mountains at an altitude of about 500 meters , it is the geographic center of Taiwan with many natural springs and a moderate climate ; the tea produced there has a unique flavor and its water is perfect for tea . "  
When the 27,000 residents of Shuili Rural Township heard that the Chichi line would be dismantled as soon as their fleet new highway was finished , they launched a mass petition drive and formed the Chichi Line Preservation Committee , pooling local tourist resources and holding special activities to attract outside visitors .  
An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds . Everyone is encouraged to put forward performing columns for the procession , and Peikang 's special tradition of yi-ko flower chariots is being preserved .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy . If you just give them a chance , they can escape from the traditional recalcitrant attitude of ' having one more thing to do is not as good as having one less thing to do . ' '  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
The promotion and advertising of formula in less developed nations has created the mistaken belief that formula is superior to mother 's milk . Yet because of limited wealth , local women thin the formula out , so that children do not get enough nutrition . Also , there is no safe , clean water , and purification and disinfecting are inadequate , so the infant mortality rate is extremely high .  
Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .  
Given that in some areas of Taiwan local residents have made a killing by developing the seafood industry by raising fish in nearby shallows , Lu Tao fishermen are even more unsettled because they are restricted from doing the same by the environmental protection regulations of the ECNSAA .  
As for outsider divers , Mr . Chen has " some thing I 'd like to say " : " They go down to the bottom wearing heavy gear , but do n't understand the nature of the water ; when they 're hit by a sudden current and ca n't get their footing , they end up carelessly grabbing and breaking off and stepping all over and destroying the coral . " But it 's the local fishermen who get stuck with the reputation for destroying the ecology .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
The maintenance of the basic rural village structure , plus leisure time and extra cash that people are willing to spend on cultural activities , is just like Taiwan shortly after retrocession , before any electronic or television media had become widespread , when local opera was definitely in its prime .  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
They have thus been preserved down to today . When a large banyan tree was " unfortunately " growing where a highway was planned to be widened at Toucheng in Ilan , the housing department 's urban planning section demanded that the local authorities remove it . In the end , a nearby temple gave up its own land for the road to pass through and the tree was saved .  
She is well aware that as an emigrant returning to her native land to work , although she has various natural advantages such as knowing English , making friends easily , and being more easily forgiven if she speaks out of line , on the other hand she has to become accustomed to things which other people are already used to , learn the demands of the local market , and overcome the difficulties of communicating in a language which she only half understands .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
But our local languages , especially within the Chinese language group , use ideographic rather than phonetic writing , and there is a clear separation between colloquial pronunciations and bookish pronunciations ; also some words have no written form , and some pronunciations are far removed from the written form . All these problems go to show that if one wishes to study local vernaculars , one faces the problem of the lack of a standardized writing system and phonetic notation .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
Come and meet the In-specting King ! " An evil visitor borne by the waves : Each year at the middle of the sixth lunar month Wen Wangyeh , the deity who resides in Yunglung Temple in Tainan , leads the local people out to receive the Inspecting King as this " high official " disembarks on his far-ranging round of inspection , followed by his retinue of abandoned souls .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep . The Taiwanese connoisseur is quite sniffy about his cup of tea . As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
The famous fishballs and " iron eggs " ( eggs boiled in diluted soy sauce until small and hard ) attracted many customers , and the exhibits , books , magazines and other records of Tanshui 's history opened a window on the town 's past . The You Theater put on local opera performances in the streets , and to watch figures being blown from hot malt sugar was mouth-watering fun for adults and children alike . . . .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
This was due to rifts within the community on the Shankuang Estate between people who had supported different candidates in the local elections , and to people from different Ami tribes insisting on their own customs . For example , in different tribes the age at which one is eligible to take part in the male initiation ceremony varies from 15 to 19 . The spread of ages included in each age grade varies from three to five years , and there are also differences in traditional dress , and so on .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
The main ceremonies of the Ami people are the " Sea Festival " held each June and the " Harvest Festival " each July and August . Travelling to the east in January as we did for this article , we missed the opportunity to attend those . But , since a local election is fast approaching , we ran into plenty of county assembly and mayoral hopefuls out trying to build up their name recognition by holding dinners in tents by the side of the road .  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
The fine arts world at that time uncovered two homegrown artists , Hung Tung and Ju Ming , and the painting world was swept by a nostalgic " native realism " emphasizing things and people from local Taiwanese culture and society , and especially from the countryside . Representative artists included Hsieh Ming-chang , Ong Ching-tu , Chen Tung-yuan , and others like Hsi Teh-chin and Hsu Kun-cheng who had awakened to this style even earlier than the others .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest . Yet local private enterprises , which , like quails , are small in stature but large in number , have not been given the attention they deserve . They have even been viewed as opportunistic and money hungry .  
For 30 years , Sanyi sold its products for export , but later Taiwan 's withdrawal from the United Nations and the international energy crisis brought a decline . Over the last decade , with a booming stock market and economic development , there has been an excellent market within Taiwan , especially for carvings of religious figures such as Maitreya Buddha , which are seen as symbols of prosperity by local people .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
Unwilling to be disturbed , Lin refused to be interviewed . Reporters then camped out around her home . Some unfurled banners in protest , others went in a group with their publisher to present a " gift " of a golden Boddhisattva , and others also sent lavish presents . And some " set a new record for the Chinese media in America " by renting a helicopter to watch the wedding ceremony from the air , attracting disapproving stares from the local citizens and greatly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood .  
A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
Moreover , it was not just anybody who could take a Japanese name - - only civil servants , teachers , village mayors , or local notables were eligible even to apply , and the application had to be reviewed and approved - - so that , in a way , the Japanese turned the unpalatable change in surnames into a kind of honor comparable to the traditional imperial surname .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
Mr . Luo of Hsinglung Beef Noodles says the choice of meat is very important : on no account should one use imported frozen beef , for imported beef does not usually arrive in Taiwan until one or two months after it has been slaughtered , so that it is not as fresh as fresh-slaughtered local beef . Furthermore , imported beef has to be thawed before use , making it soft so that it can not be boiled for long without breaking up .  
According to the original recipe , the beef is first sliced and placed on top of the cooked noodles , then a superior stock made from chicken bones , medicinal herbs , shrimp sauce , fish sauce and so on is poured in ; lastly various raw vegetables such as chiutsengta and purple perilla are added , along with local herbs and leaves .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
For instance , some people like to take fish spears underwater to catch fish . This not only results in a reduction of that species , but also affects the local food chain , or it forces fish schools to swim farther out to sea . Try to avoid disturbing the ecology . Also , many divers trample on soft coral or move pieces of stony coral , so that the algae and other organisms living on them die .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
At the beginning of December 1992 , they organized the first public hearing over the Meinung reservoir . At the same time , in order to build consensus among local citizens , they took to driving a rickety old farm vehicle without a license plate , with signs on the front and rear painted by artist Tseng Wen-chung which said in large letters , " For farm use " and " Seventh Section Work Station . "  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual . It is inconceivable that the local Chinese forces would have dared to spark an incident during the night maneuvers by the Japanese forces .  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
But the fact that the Chungho cases were all concentrated in a specific area ( around the small mountain behind Le Tien Temple and a few areas of similar topography ) means that the vectors have set down very firm roots in this city in northern Taiwan , creating what is defined as a " local epidemic . "  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Whenever there was a construction site , a few bizarre pieces of stone , some large , some small , would appear on the surface of the ground . Some of them were still recognizable in shape ; it was obvious that they were knives , axes , arrowheads or other crafted objects that people had used at one time . Huge stone slabs made local residents suspect that they were the lids of coffins for some people of long ago .  
For example , every time he heard tell of a construction project going on within the range of the ruins , Tacheng Middle School teacher Chien Shih-lang would grab a metal screen and head for the dirt pile to " search for treasure , " sifting out from the dirt pile shards of stone coffin and other objects stirred up by the backhoes and arranging them in separate bags . He saved them , both as a record of local history and also as classroom material of local interest .  
Even if most of the descendants of the Ketagalan have forgotten their own identity , according to an investigation by Lin En-shean , a professor at National Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Ethnology , in the wake of the recent increasing social emphasis on " native soil , " meaning a new esteem for local Taiwanese culture , the atmosphere in society toward minority ethnic groups has evolved from prejudice and taboo to respect .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
Grabbing the bird , I discovered that the webbing of her foot had been pierced by a hook caught in a rope used by the local aquaculturists . The swan 's blood was turning the water around her red . I quickly tried to pull out the fish hook with my hands , but the hook was too deeply caught in the flesh , and I ended up cutting my own index finger instead . All the while , the injured bird was splashing and struggling to fly away , drenching us with lake water .  
But Legislative Yuan members , local politicians and landowners rushed en masse to intervene , and the plan to " resurrect " Shihmen 's water sources was thrown out by the Ministry of the Interior . In August this year , after the disastrous typhoon , the residential , commercial and recreational zones around the Shihmen Reservoir were finally reduced in size .  
Sitting on the local as it shook and jiggled , I noticed that most of the other riders were elderly . Some of these grandfathers went so far as to stretch out on the seats for a nap . A grandmother had a shoulder pole with bamboo baskets full of vegetables that she was bringing to market . A few aboriginal women wearing broad-rimmed rain hats and carrying bamboo baskets got off in Tahsi on the way to odd jobs in nearby harbors .  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
But at a time when local cultural consciousness is flourishing , and with the associated preference for local plant and animal species , the sudden epidemic of disease among lowland pine trees has been greeted with no great concern by many in forestry and botanical circles . This is because the pine trees in Taiwan 's plains are all introduced species brought by immigrant settlers and colonists , who planted them out of nostalgia for their old homes .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Of ' Mui 's twin sons Huegu ( Chang Hui-kuo ) and ' Api , the one plays guitar to a professional standard , and the other has been described as an excellent singer ever since he was in elementary school . Once he was grown up , ' Api was hired by several tourist " culture villages " in Hualien County as a singing and dancing instructor . He has frequently gone overseas to represent his local area in international aboriginal singing and dancing performances .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines . Upon entering the country , every leader , conforming to local custom , changed into a Filipino shirt , marked by dazzling patterns and bright , fresh colors . The collective photo which all the leaders lined up for is permeated by the style and passion of Southeast Asia . It makes a strong impression on anyone who sees it , wherever they may be from .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Among the heavy responsibilities weighing on the superintendent 's shoulders , besides having to find financial donations , is that of finding people . Recruiting local doctors has proved difficult-several times when the hospital advertised for staff there were very few applicants , and some doctors who did agree to come and work subsequently changed their minds when another opportunity came up . The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
From the memories of old family members and from old photographs , one can reconstruct the exquisite scene of former times : at dawn the dense mist hanging over the seven pools enshrouds the surrounding paddy fields , but as the first rays of sunshine strike through , one sees the Li Family Compound , built of bricks and stone , standing sturdy among the expanse of green . This is why the local nickname for this great house was " Beauty in the Fields . "  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
The Japanese were the first to lay roads into the region in order to crush anti-Japanese resistance on Mt . Tsao . Stumbling upon the volcanic topography , they built the hot spring baths for which the whole area from Mt . Tsao to Peitou would become famous . From 1924 , the Japanese began an effort to " create a forest on Mt . Tatun . " They also encouraged local farmers to set up nurseries , which are the forerunners of the flower farms visited by tourists today .  
Taiwan and Silicon Valley are currently mutually dependent . But Silicon Valley , possessing such a broad , deep and up-to-date technological foundation , is the world 's technology capital . Over the last two spring vacations , Wu Se-hwa , director of Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management , has taken graduate students to see Silicon Valley first hand . He reminds the local industry : " If Taiwan hopes to continue to advance , it must continue to import people and experience from Silicon Valley . "  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired . " More class time is spent explaining English than teaching subject matter , " says Professor Chi Hsi-sheng of HKUST 's Division of Social Science .  
The former is a passive network . It is activated when a doctor anywhere in Taiwan comes across any disease which , according to law , must be reported ; the doctor then files a report with the local bureau of public health . The latter network involves cooperation among public health agencies and about 800 doctors nationwide . Each week a telephone survey is done of the situation in various areas , so that there is constant active monitoring of overall public health conditions .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
In local folk-worship traditions in Taiwan , there are so-called " unmarried miss temples , " dedicated to women who died unwed . Deceased unmarried women are considered to be among the " lonely souls without homes " to whom offerings are made on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month each year . This is because memorial tablets for unmarried women can not be placed in the family home after their deaths , so there is no one to make offerings to them in the afterlife .  
Taiwanese has survived only because people of Fujianese ancestry are the majority in Taiwan . However , though policies designed to suppress the use of all dialects ( such as fining or hanging humiliating placards on students who spoke dialect in school , or restricting time dedicated to programming in local dialects as did the broadcasting law promulgated in 1976 ) the impression was deepened that Taiwanese was relatively crude-a " low class " language that , though perhaps more intimate , was not suitable for elegant situations .  
During a visit by Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan , the local people , exasperated by the effects of two calamities in quick succession , aimed a torrent of invective against the government 's inappropriate planning and poor preventative measures . Some people blamed the flooding on inadequacies in straightening work carried out on downstream sections of the Keelung River , causing flooding further upstream .  
In the case of another elder generation artist , when the owners of the Hsinsheng South Road studio in which Lee Shih-chiao spent nearly 40 years reclaimed the premises , a space in the Apollo Building in east Taipei had to be purchased instead . Although a museum was established , as a consequence it lost its potential local commemorative significance .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
Thus evolved seafood dining in Taiwan , from simple roadside stands by the harbors to specialty shops to the " Warring States Period " pitting high-class restaurants against cheap chain shops against fresh fish street vendors . Meanwhile , because seafood raised in aquaculture ponds or imported from abroad has steadily replaced local seafood caught near the shores of Taiwan , the " most-favored fish " lists-especially for wedding banquet dishes-have seen some radical changes of fortune .  
Mrs . Hung , who grew up in Tanshui and runs a seafood restaurant , nostalgically recalls eating chouduyu ( a siganid ) caught at the mouth of the Tanshui River . She says : " Natural chouduyu did n't even need salt , it tasted fragrant and sweet just fried up straight . If you buy chouduyu that was raised in an aquaculture pond , you have to add soy sauce just to cover the smell of the earth . " But local fish caught in the open ocean like the chouduyu are growing scarce .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work . They founded the Tong Hsin Volunteer Service Association , whose efforts are focused on services for the elderly and on recycling . They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
In 1930 , aborigines in the area of Wushe stormed a sports day at the local school , killing over 100 Japanese , including policemen and teachers . The motivation for the attack was anger at Japan 's repressive policies for " governing the barbarians , " by which the authorities endeavored to requisition territory and exploit the forestry resources of Taiwan 's central highlands . Under these policies , the culture and traditional ways of life of aboriginal tribes were effectively outlawed , and those that resisted were massacred .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
Once a week we worked on a specific topic assigned by Marian . We did role playing ( bought and sold stocks , for example ) , prepared a newspaper column , visited a local junior college , and picked wild strawberries . We even carried out a mock American-style election by printing out election ballots . Marian brought her shower curtain from home to set up a voting booth in the classroom .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
Filling the open spaces around the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung , and crowded onto nearby rooftops , some 20,000 spectators , including over 200 local and international journalists , were waiting for the action-an enormous number given the usual low attendance at art events .  
The scrap contained large amounts of insulation material made of plastics containing chlorine , so burning it produced highly toxic dioxin . The stench from the fires forced pupils at the nearby Nanning Junior High School to wear cotton face masks to school , and there were high rates of respiratory tract diseases among local residents .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
" Formerly , Taiwan under its authoritarian political system never cultivated mechanisms to encourage autonomy . It lacked a civil society given to self-reflection . It was n't in the habit of discussing , deliberating and making judgments , and it lacked a concern for local affairs . " Ping Lu 's soft , moderate tone reveals an undercurrent of hurt .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
The Lin family 's " New Tile House " was built almost two centuries ago , and is the oldest family compound in the Liuchia high-speed rail development area . The high-speed rail plan originally called for the ancestral shrine and some of the defensive walls to be preserved as a park , but local residents and the Lin family are not satisfied with this solution and have been protesting to the agency in charge of the high-speed rail in the hope of persuading it to preserve the entire compound .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
In Anhui Province there was Ouyang Xiu 's self-effacingly named Pavilion of the Drunk Old Gentleman , where the mind of the aforementioned gentleman was preoccupied with scenic wonders rather than the next drink . The settings of these retreats reflected the aesthetic ideals of the literati and their detached approach to life , and it was these same people , the educated elite , who set the tone for national and local administration during the Song dynasty .  
Many scholar-officials also formed communities out of their own extended families by establishing clan congregations , updating genealogies , and setting up private schools to educate promising youngsters . These new forms of local organization helped society to remain orderly and civilized , and fostered an overall mood of culture and enlightenment . Rule by the learned  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
In 1553 , during the Ming dynasty , after a Portuguese " tribute ship " was blown aground , the Portuguese captain asked to lease a nearby fishing village to dry out the goods . A local maritime official acceded to the request . In 1614 , after the Portuguese had assisted the Ming court in defeating pirates , Viceroy Zhang Ming-gang secured the emperor 's consent to allow Portuguese to settle permanently in Macau .  
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water . When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience . " If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
In the 1980s , a number of young directors joined Taiwan 's film community . They made a bold break with tradition and gave rise to a new wave in local film . After a harsh winnowing , only Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang remained , the former noted for his excellent grasp of Taiwanese imagery and the latter for his clinical depiction of the urban middle class .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
Li Hsi-chi got his initial inspiration from the inscribed wooden plaques that grace the door lintels of clan temples in Kinmen . He executed an entire series of paintings based on them before moving on to throw occasional poetry events modeled after the elegant parties indulged in by the upper classes in centuries past . Li also called on artists and writers from both Taiwan and the mainland to tour Kinmen and understand the beauty of the local culture . These activities spurred the local community to a heightened interest in cultural preservation .  
Dong enjoys enthusiastic support from the local community , which has provided him with generous financial assistance , manpower , filming locations , and more . The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August . He devoted particular attention to the local investment climate in each country , and came up with a few suggestions of his own .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
In fact , I 'm furious with it , but what can I do ? " The leaders of 23 local governments signed a petition demanding that the central government allocate still more of the Tax Redistribution Fund to them . " The petition was immediately supported by everyone , regardless of party affiliation , and regardless of whether they were on Taiwan proper or its outlying islands . "  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
The elected heads of Taipei County , Taichung City , Tainan City , Ilan County , and other local governments around Taiwan are in virtually unanimous agreement that " the central government should completely re-think its revenue sharing philosophy and formulate consistent criteria for determining a fair distribution . Such criteria might include population , land area , and degree of need . "  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
The 47% share previously allotted to Taipei and Kaohsiung was decided upon last year after the government canceled a plan to abolish all local sales taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax . Now that this share has been lowered to 43% , the other cities and counties have seen their combined share go up to 39% , with each local government 's individual share calculated on the basis of population , land area , and other factors .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
The Nankang Hills stretch across the Taipei Basin as a straight finger of low sandstone peaks 140-370 meters high . Their highly uneven topography , carved out by the abundant local rainfall , has meant that despite lying cheek by jowl with the city , they have been spared destructive overdevelopment and have been able to maintain a basic forest environment . The hills ' great diversity of microenvironments creates a paradise for ferns .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
Kuanshan Township is located in Taitung County , in the flat bottom of the East Longitudinal Valley . The Hsinwulu River runs through the township , and there are high mountains to either side . The majority of the residents are involved in farming , in particular growing Kuanshan rice , which is especially tasty because of the pristine local water . Such industrial activity as there is is of a low-polluting kind , allowing Kuanshan to retain its good natural environment .  
Grow Lin of YCF BonEagle notes that every level of government in the PRC , from central to local , and the various high-tech parks , are all very sensitive to what businesses want , and the incentives they offer to attract firms change correspondingly fast . Anything that does n't fit demand , or industries for which the market is already saturated , are likely to be left with nothing but the bones to chew on .  
Pingtung County Councilor Lin Yu-hung has raised the issue before the county council , stating : " Taiwan 's pending entry into the World Trade Organization will have a tremendous impact on traditional industries . The Pingtung County Government must promote the use of more advanced farming techniques and consider how to make local farmers more competitive . "  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
So runs a local rhyme passed down by the residents of southern Taiwan 's Tungkang Township . Tungkang is a fishing village famed not only for its " three treasures " - bluefin tuna , oilfish and banded coral shrimp-but also for its Tapeng Bay National Scenic Area . Here in Tungkang , tourists and locals rub shoulders on streets scented with the damp smell of the sea , while out on the sea a few speckled boats pitch and roll as they sail slowly towards China .  
I found the most recent issue of Sinorama , with its reports on the special local character of places like Tungkang , Meinung , Chiaotou , and Linpien , very refreshing . The reports were very touching , and much more thoughtful than the usual tour book blurbs . This is the kind of reporting that is really lacking in our society today , and offers a sense of intimacy that Taiwanese readers abroad can really appreciate .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
Many family pedigrees in the local area also provide evidence of the fearsome loss of life that occurred . The deluge even came to the attention of the emperor himself , who ordered the imperial granary to ship emergency rice supplies . It was impossible to dig separate graves for each of the victims , so they ended up laid to rest in four large pits . Expressing deep sorrow over the disaster , the emperor declared that the " spirits of the victims would all end up in heaven just like the rest of us . "  
In the 1980s , she spent five years trekking around the coral rocks of Kenting , observing a local troupe of macaques . During that time their numbers gradually increased , but then suddenly almost the entire troupe was killed by hunters , and the population growth accumulated over many years was wiped out overnight . By the time Wu had finished writing up her thesis , the few survivors had disappeared among the windswept coral .  
A major reason is that unsophisticated Aboriginal people of that era were often cheated and oppressed by Han Chinese , so in comparison Maxwell 's apparently selfless efforts were very much appreciated , and word spread fast to all the local tribal communities .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
" If you divide the financial sector up into state-run banks , private local banks , and foreign banks , the most at-risk group is that made up of the large state-run banks , which currently have the largest market share , " says Schive Chi , who knows what he 's talking about after years of experience in banking . The style of foreign banks is to make quick decisions based on comprehensive data , wielding a flexible array of products that keep up with the market .  
This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
This is a song of Kukeng Rural Township , written by a local resident . It accompanies newlyweds and couples from the rural township celebrating their golden and diamond anniversaries as they walk through a tunnel of densely packed foliage , symbolizing the continual revitalization of romance .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
Little League baseball remains an inte-gral link in the memories all Taiwanese have of growing up . Professional baseball was also immensely popular for a time . However , in recent years , following regrettable incidents involving gambling and manipulation of players by local organized crime syndicates , baseball withered in the public 's fancy .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
In contrast to its fellow " Little Dragons , " Taiwan 's economic policy has been waffling since 1997 . With so much still up in the air , foreign investors have been unwilling to put their money into Taiwan and local businesspeople have begun losing patience with the government 's dithering . Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of Taiwan 's economic outlook is that government and industry are headed in opposite directions and the distance between them is growing .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
On the day of the French defeat , local residents subsequently ordained a ritual so as to pay homage to the ghosts of those who died so far from home . Regardless of whether the battle victims were from the mainland province of Hunan or from far-off France , all were buried within close proximity of one another , and received the same burial rites-an ending that is at once ironic and tragic .  
The Chinkuashih area has a unique , long , and complex history of geological activity . Tahan College associate professor Yu Ping-sheng , who has extensively studied the local geology , tells us that the sedimentary rock which forms the area accumulated on the ocean floor 25 million years ago .  
Li Tung-liang , a director of the Chaoyang Lukang Association , points out that in the early years of the Guangxu reign period ( 1871-1908 ) of the Qing dynasty , the Quanzhou woodcarving master Li Ko-chiu moved to Lukang , where he gathered together all the local wood sculptors and organized a guild . Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .  
But those workers who have lost their jobs are quite a different group from the workers in such urgent demand in industry . Michael Hsiao pointed out that those who are out of work have lost their jobs because changes in Taiwan 's industrial structure have made their skills obsolete . Continuing the restructuring of local industry is not going to create jobs for this group . Hsiao argued that the government should instead address the unemployment problem through social assistance measures , and the shortage of workers in key industries through economic policy .  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
The late Lin Heng-tao , an expert on local history and customs , wrote that during the Japanese occupation the Octagon Market was Taiwan 's most fashionable shopping area . Popular merchandise included milk candy , red bean sweet bread , Tong Luo barbeque , sushi , and other Japanese foods . There were also handguns , telescopes , Japanese Warrior brand art supplies , toys , sake , beer , and soft drinks .  
He enlarged the puppets , put more modern faces on them and dressed them in brighter costumes . He used dry ice and flash powder to create a variety of stage effects . He also made changes to the music , importing a sound system and making bold use of local pop stars and Western music to accompany his plays . His golden-light theater came to dominate puppetry and he himself rose to the top of his generation of puppeteers .  
Academia Sinica professor Chen Kuo-tung , who served as chief editor of Leaves in the Wind , is quick to concede that the historical materials in the book have to be taken with a grain of salt , but argues that it makes a valuable contribution by bringing together scattered impressions of Taiwan that Westerners have had over a span of more than three centuries , thus giving local readers a chance to understand what their homeland has looked like to foreigners .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
We 're not afraid of competition . The more people in Taiwan get into this industry the better , for strength comes from solidarity . " Eric Lee , president of Softstar Entertainment , a major local computer games company , says that companies such as Softstar , Wang Film and CGCG have already formed a strategic alliance . They have also set up an " academy of the new arts , " in which experienced industry workers teach courses in order to pass on their knowledge and skills as quickly as possible .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
Although these two parties , the only legal minority parties at the time , played only a marginal role as " tokens " of democracy under Kuomintang authoritarianism , nonetheless thanks to the idealism of key members like Chiang Yun-tien and Kao Yu-shu , and to popular disaffection with the KMT , the CDSP remained active in local elections and constituted a force outside the KMT .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
If the rising popularity of alternative medicine in the US is a reaction against the rapid development of Western scientific culture , in Taiwan it is more a case of people taking a fresh look at some " old stuff " that is deeply rooted in local traditional culture .  
Chang Chuan-fen , a veteran activist in the gay and women 's rights movements , wrote a couple of lesbian novels packed with local color-Against the Wall and Freestyle Love-that earned rave reviews and sold extremely well , much to the amazement of the publishing industry .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
Protection of the local industry has become a leitmotif of the communist authorities ' video policy since 2000 . Fostered by the government , TV series have indeed seen rapid progress . Not only have they developed a distinct dramatic style native to China , they have also taken control of the viewership , and the high rate of return on investment is driving the development of the entire TV industry . Stations in every province are forming into groups that are capable of holding their own against the CCTV .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
While promoting his film in Taiwan , Zhang and local director Hou Hsiao-hsien engaged in a lengthy chat about their " ideal " martial arts film at Taipei Film House . Zhang pointed out that his film was set in the time immediately before the first Qin emperor had unified all of China . At that moment in history , it would have been impossible for people to foresee his eventual transformation into a tyrant ; therefore , the assassin is able to place trust in the emperor .  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
During this fourth clinic of Tzu Chi 's held on Batam , altogether 901 patients were helped by the combined efforts of more than 150 Tzu Chi volunteers and 61 doctors from the medical association , as well as 9 local doctors and 52 local volunteers . In addition , more than a dozen volunteers from other Chinese Buddhist organizations also joined in or helped in transporting patients from offshore islands .  
Li says that in Indonesia , where anti-Chinese sentiment is intense , the fact that Tzu Chi often lends a hand is gradually changing local attitudes toward Chinese . Now , if you go out wearing the " blue sky and white clouds " volunteer uniform of Tzu Chi , people will always greet you with a smile .  
He eventually discovered that the paper most suitable for sky lanterns was the kind used under the steamed turtle buns presented as an offering to the Lord of Heaven on the ninth day of the first lunar month . And so every year on the eve of the Lantern Festival he would volunteer to work at the local cake shop in exchange for a few sheets of uncut white paper .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
According to Clio Chi , executive director of the Eastern Culture Foundation , once given the opportunity to show their talent , Aboriginal children invariably end up surprising everybody . After the foundation started funding Paling Elementary School , a school in Taoyuan County attended by Aboriginal children , that school 's website soon took first place in a nationwide contest and even became an outlet for online sales of the peaches grown on Lala Mountain , thus helping to spearhead local economic development .  
She confidently points out that her own English pronunciation is accurate , and she is capable of leading classroom activities , knows how to prepare a curriculum , and understands the background of local students . On the other hand , " foreign teachers are n't necessarily superior instructors because they do n't have experience teaching Taiwanese students , and they are n't as sensitive to the kinds of linguistic difficulties that Taiwanese students encounter , " Lu says .  
While this is not the case with the SARS epidemic-there are press conferences almost every day at every level of government from the premier down to local government officials , as well as at all major hospitals , so that there is considerable information available-SARS has still had an impact of unprecedented scope , with related issues that include the quarantine of over 10,000 people , sealing of hospitals and neighborhoods , closing of schools , creation of dedicated facilities , proper use and distribution of masks and protective clothing , and economic aid to affected industries .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
Ching Ching Farm in central Taiwan is also driving local economic growth . It offers activities like getting up-close with the sheep herd there , and there is also the attraction of nearby peach and apple orchards . Nearby , not only are there rows of restaurants opened by locals , but even the international chains 7-11 and Starbucks coffee houses have opened outlets , leading to a perfect fusion of the romance of the sheep ranch with the consumer habits of the visitors .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth . The teaching hospitals then inspected 69 regional hospitals , which , in turn , inspected 400 local hospitals . In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
With the debate , two factions-one mainland , one Taiwanese-became apparent within Taiwanese literature . In the tumultuous times immediately following the war , the leading lights of the local literary scene who were still writing or editing fell on hard times , with most of those who did n't retire ending up either in jail or dead .  
" In addition to shaping and achieving goals , it 's also important to fill people 's bellies , " says Lee . He notes that after Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , local factories moved abroad and unemployment became a serious problem . Consequently , the community development program will only be judged a success if it is able to revive the community and resolve residents ' economic difficulties . With that in mind , the development of distinctive local industries has been an urgent concern .  
The 10 kite-makers the program has trained since 2002 have done quite well . Under resident master kite-maker Lee Hou-jui 's tutelage , local mothers have not only learned a craft and acquired a source of income , but now also travel to schools all over Taiwan teaching students how to make kites . They were also very successful at last year 's National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports ' Kite Contest , where they won several prizes .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
After local people began to gather here in large numbers , the " Fangliao Good Life Society " was established to promote artistic and literary events in the community . A resounding success , in 1998 the site was voted a national model for the improvement of urban landscapes .  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
You can see incorrect usage wherever you look . I 'll give you some examples . After mainland tour groups started coming to Taiwan , I was hired to train local tour guides . I advised them to be sure that visitors from Shandong Province would n't be offended by the ubiquitous shop signs advertising lu rou fan ( rice topped with chunks of pork stewed in black bean sauce ) .  
Thinking back on his career as a local official , Lin says that as the representative of the county executive and spokesperson for the county government , he was tied down by countless details and small tasks . He would often be awakened by phone calls in the middle of the night-having just got to sleep after yet another busy day . His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
On September 13 , the Ministry of Education held the National Education Development Conference . At the conference , the central topic for higher education was " Promoting the Quality of Higher Education to Raise International Competitiveness . " The stated objective was to have a local university enter the ranks of the world 's top hundred universities within ten years , and have at least ten key academic departments or inter-institution research centers ranked first in Asia in their respective categories .  
Currently other localities are lining up to threaten the use of referendums to give expression to local aspirations . For example , Hsihu Township in Miaoli County is seeking to have a Hsihu exit built on the Central Second Freeway , Wulai Rural Township in Taipei County is demanding that the government abolish the toll booths that collect environmental maintenance fees in the Wulai Scenic Area , Penghu County is demanding the opening of tourist casinos , etc . In no time at all the referendum seems to have become the convenient new favorite for solving deadlocked disputes .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
Of course , the war was not in the least affected by the protest . But it is gratifying that on this subject at least there was a broad consensus among local feminist organizations , returning to the basic starting points of the women 's movement : love , peace , justice , and human rights . Perhaps it is by returning to basic humane values that the women 's movement in Taiwan will enjoy a resurgence .  
People doing modern ceramic art have always played down local culture , so I decided to seek creative motifs in my ethnic background . That fits in well with today 's emphasis on things rooted specifically in Taiwanese culture . " After embarking on his new path , Li at first made heavy use of the motifs appearing in traditional paintings used for celebrating Chinese New Year .  
Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .  
Because of US bombing raids during World War II , the Japanese instituted a policy of dispersal . When Chiu was six the whole family was moved to his maternal grandmother 's house in Tunghsiao Township , Miaoli County . American and Japanese planes would frequently engage in dogfights overhead , and each time the aerial battles finished , the local residents would go to the waterside in search of aluminum and plexiglas . The pieces of aluminum could be cut and trimmed into rice spatulas , and the plexiglas could be turned into toys .  
Chiu held onto a spirit of " releasing the spirit tied up by the cities and returning to the peaceful , simple life of the country . " Putting features of Taiwanese scenery-whether from Lanyu , Penghu , or Chiufen-into his paintings , he came at his topics from a critical angle . Rather than making comparisons about beauty or ugliness , he relied on inner feeling-taking his melancholy and concerns about the transformation of the local landscape and revealing them for everyone to see on his canvases .  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste . As for the disposition of collected kitchen waste , " 70% is used primarily for raising pigs , and composting accounts for 30% , " says Lin Tso-hsiang , section chief for kitchen waste recycling operations at the Environmental Protection Administration 's Bureau of Environmental Inspection . During the current phase , local governments have not been required to institute kitchen waste recycling ; they are merely encouraged to do so .  
Of particular importance was the fact that although the hydroelectric plant was to be donated gratis to the local community , the community would then be responsible for all future management and upkeep . This was deemed the only way to ensure sustainable operation and prevent the facility falling into disrepair for lack of maintenance as soon as the aid team left .  
Because of this , creative education has been established as a four-year pilot project with an annual budget of NT $ 60 million . In spirit , it will encourage diversification , differentiation , and maybe even a little rebellion and mischief . In practical terms , whether in innovation in educational methods , reform in educational materials , innovation in student performance or in reforming and restructuring campus spaces , any good ideas will receive support . And because this effort is a local , piecemeal , gradual bottom-up process , it will not encounter much opposition .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman . However , this adventurous spirit , who feels that sleeping in the wild is more comfortable than sleeping in a bed , seemed destined to return to the mountains , to the unpopulated wilds , and to the swift currents of the sea .  
" Given the inadequate economic scale and lack of material incentives , Taiwan baseball has a tough row to hoe , " says Jackie Shao , an assistant professor in sports science at Taipei Physical Education College . She argues , however , that there is nothing inherently good or bad about any particular path ; rather , this is the model that has evolved by trial and error over many years , and the one most suited to local conditions .  
Apart from its high altitude , the Yushan Weather Station is also located on the Tropic of Cancer . This is a special location combining high altitude with low longitude , precisely where the Pacific and continental air masses interact . That means meteorological data observed here has an important reference value for local weather forecasts .  
Now , that land is more than just a " natural classroom " for the 11 classes on ecology , flora , and fauna at the college ; it 's also been opened to the public , becoming a well known place for the people of Yungho and Chungho-particularly local elementary and junior high school kids-to come and get in touch with nature . The college also trains volunteer guides for the garden to meet the huge demand from the local community to visit it .  
After the workshop concluded , the members went on to form the Wenshan Neovista Association , launching a series of talks , fighting for funding , planning the renovation effort , getting the opinions of local residents , and construction companies involved in the effort . After three years of hard work , they finally completed the project . Soon after completion the college opened the hall with a series of art and literature activities , using it to pass on the area 's rich art and culture .  
As the maritime point of entry and exit for northern Taiwan , Keelung was able ( thanks in part to intense lobbying by local government and elected officials ) to gain central government approval despite its currently having only 68 hectares of available land . The FTZ there is set to begin operating in late September this year .  
For the children 's forest playground , Chang designed the observation deck , determined the angle at which to set the slide , and calculated how much wood would be needed for the project . Using timber from the coconut palms , the most abundant local source of wood , the villagers built the entire playground themselves .  
During previous typhoons , after a flood release from the reservoir , it was always possible to wait a few days for the river water to clear up and start providing potable water again . But this time people were not so lucky . Six or seven days after Aere the turbidity of the water remained high , leading to Taoyuan being declared a disaster area due to a severe water shortage , and a war of words broke out between local and central authorities over responsibility .  
This typhoon caused the people of Taoyuan a great deal of pain and suffering as they were forced to go without water for many days . Industrial losses are estimated at NT $ 10 billion . Heads of agencies at the local and central government level are exhausted by their efforts . The chairman and the CEO of Taiwan Water Corporation stepped down , and there was a strong reaction among the corporation 's employees .  
Though going through the worst wave of overseas relocations by local industry in history and facing increasingly bitter competition in industrial development , this year , thanks to a turn for the better in the international economy , Taiwan 's economic performance has stabilized .  
Hsu tells an anecdote : more than ten years ago , local inventor Huang Ying-chun devised an air-cushioned shoe . Unfortunately , due to the fact that at the time accessing relevant information was problematic , he did not scrutinize foreign patents and applied only for a domestic patent , with the result that this patent was later challenged and overturned by Nike .

He was born in 1968 in Shanhua Township , Tainan County . In middle school he began to attend the local Holy Church , where Rev . Wang Tung-ho filled him with inspiration and guided his religious development . In his 30s , Wang had given up a bright future in the city and moved to the countryside to minister to the ordinary folk of the township .  
The area was once central Taiwan 's main aquacultural center , with all kinds of fish being raised there . Traders would come from around the island to strike deals with the local farmers , who did double duty as their own wholesalers . For a while , trade was brisk , but over recent decades the industry has been on the decline , and is now of little real note . Already it seems like people are forgetting this important part of Taiwan 's history .  
In the old days , the wealthy regarded artistic brickwork , and wood and stone carvings , as ways to decorate their houses and flaunt their wealth . The last two have stayed as large parts of local culture , but brickwork somehow fell out of favor , and so Liao set herself to reviving brickworking as a living part of the culture .  
This is part of the reason that Liao 's husband Chang Cheng-yuen decided to get involved in the brickmaking industry , even though he never had any contact with it as a child . In fact , Chang has developed a repertoire of over 70 different styles of brick , and his exquisite workmanship has even attracted clients like McDonald 's , who contracted him to build the local outlet a pond and a set of brickwork golden arches . Having such a major company recognise their work has encouraged Liao and Chang immensely .  
" Holding the Chinese Food Week on the very day as Chinese President Jiang Zemin finished a successful visit to Latvia has a special meaning , which will give more local people and guests to Riga a chance to have delicious Chinese food and learn the Chinese culinary culture , " said Carl Mains , general manager of the hotel on the opening ceremony of the Food Week .

Provision is made for a daily allowance for incidental personal expenses to be paid to up to 1,273 military personnel for a total of 207,698 troop days at a rate of $ 1.28 per troop per day , payable in local currency . 
The preparation , completion and implementation of the NPA often involves a broad selection of institutions , governmental and non-governmental , religious and secular , public and private , national , regional and local .  
Ensuring a modicum of the sense of individual , local and national security : peaceful political and favourable national and international economic conditions .  
This transformation is being pursued on the basis of new perceptions about development , which see in popular participation , individual and local initiative and private business activity the key to economic recovery and sustainable economic growth .  
As part of the implementation of the project , a total of 25 specific studies are being completed at the field level by local experts , covering all major economic and social sectors .

Mountain farming furthermore relies on the exploitation of highly variable and complex ecological niches , where local knowledge is often superior to what extension agents can offer based on research and experience derived from extensive lowland farming systems .  
A major development in government policy concerning mountain communities is the increased understanding of the importance of local control over natural resource management and security of resources , especially land tenure , as the main incentives for investment in environmentally sound technologies and improved land husbandry .  
The support units seem widespread - they are responsible for developing local guidelines for national execution , training line ministries on national execution procedures , preparing the required national execution reports , facilitating contractual arrangements with cooperating and implementation agencies and generally providing support to the technical ministries hosting nationally executed programmes .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .

If differences among countries ' living standards are the focus of the comparison , then a purchasing-power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate is regarded as the most appropriate method , as it values the commodities and services sold in each country at a set of common international prices , rather than at local prices multiplied by the value of the national currency determined in the foreign exchange market .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .

The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Seminars and training programmes were to be organized on the prevention of crime in urban and other areas , and sound crime prevention strategies developed , capable of being adapted to local conditions , with particular reference to the approaches suggested at the relevant workshops held during the Ninth Congress .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .

Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , and sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .

Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
Second , the strategy to be pursued must be based on growth with equity , the full participation of all actors in development , including civil society , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the poor themselves , and should involve a decentralized approach in which decisions and resources allocation can be made at the local level , taking into account the specific conditions and needs of the target groups or areas .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector .

One of these goals , formulated in the founding resolution of the Decade ( resolution 44 / 236 ) , is to provide by the year 2000 ready access for all countries to global , regional , national and local warning systems and the possibility of broad dissemination of warnings . 
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
Based on this research , a training programme has been developed to strengthen national and regional capacity for strategic development policy analysis , focusing on tools and techniques that incorporate the local cultural and social context for evaluating the socio-economic driving forces of structural change . 
The Programme of Action calls on Governments to increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially , inter alia , by formulating or strengthening , preferably by 1996 , and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels .

The Plan focuses on stimulating and supporting national and local activities and initiatives and is built upon the idea of a partnership between Governments , international organizations , NGOs , professional associations , individuals and large segments of civil society .  
For the period starting on 1 May 1995 up to 31 October 1995 , the MINUSAL team was composed of 11 Professionals , headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General at the assistant secretary-general level , supported by 8 civilian police , 1 internationally recruited General Service staff and 15 local level staff .  
The average monthly cost for the previous period was $ 5,000 , but requirements for the current period are expected to be much higher because , while some of these services were covered under the logistic support services contract during the last mandate , the new service contract does not provide for them , thus requiring use of local contractors to provide these services .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
In that connection , activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations , increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international , regional and national organizations and agencies .  
The additional requirements of $ 3,165,000 reported under this heading were mainly attributable to the following : ( a ) an amount equivalent to one month 's salary ( $ 885,500 ) was paid to 1,454 local staff in lieu of notice ; and ( b ) an amount of $ 2,197,400 was recorded in the reporting period in respect of salaries paid to the local staff in the previous mandate periods .

However , the economy of the territory has not changed and the occupying authority , Israel , is continuing its old practices , which are incompatible with international law and local custom , including unjustified detention , blockades , collective punishment and the expansion of existing settlements .  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities that are sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly if State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , Governments should devise innovative privatization plans so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions performed before privatization ;

For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .

Objectives of this endeavour include protecting public health , providing for safety and security conditions , education , and social integration , promoting equality , respect for diversity and cultural identities , increased accessibility for persons with disabilities , and preservation of historic , spiritual , religious and culturally significant buildings and districts , respecting local landscapes and treating the local environment with respect and care .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
National , subnational and local policies and development plans must be carefully re-examined to ensure optimal land use and geographically better balanced economic development , including the protection of indispensable agricultural land ; land that sustains biodiversity , water quality and groundwater recharge ; fragile areas , including coastal areas ; and other sensitive areas in need of protection . 83 bis .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .  
To promote social integration , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , recognizing the importance of volunteer contributions and in close cooperation with non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , the cooperative sector and public and private foundations , should :  
Provide accessible , affordable , impartial , prompt and humane local systems of justice by , inter alia , facilitating and strengthening , where appropriate , existing traditional institutions and procedures for the resolution of disputes and conflicts ; ( e bis . )  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
Undertaking the valuation of the goods and services of a forest at local , national , regional and global levels is a complex and costly exercise that must be carried out in response to specific demands and guided by the type of decisions for which the results are to be used .  
This approach provides the necessary base for moving towards sustainable land-use systems within which forests are clearly recognized as an option with its own validity in contributing to sustainability at local , national and global levels . 
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
Promoting construction methods , materials and technologies that are affordable , safe , efficient and accessible and that emphasize greater use of local materials and human resources , that encourage and support design efficiency and energy-saving methods , and that are environmentally sound and protective of human health ;  
We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
Using resources and economic instruments in an effective , efficient and equitable manner at the local , national , regional and international levels ;  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
Encouraging multilateral development institutions and donors to support nations in their effort to pursue enabling strategies through which national and local governments , communities and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in shelter and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Fixed satellite communications had given noticeable support to the growth of global , regional , national and local networks for government institutions and private enterprises in their daily operations .  
In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
It was stated that the objectives of an emergency monitoring system were : ( a ) to provide national protection agencies and relevant research institutions with information to support strategic and emergency decisions ; ( b ) to re-establish the telecommunications and environmental data collection systems when an event had occurred in order to coordinate the local relief operations from the coordinating centre and to collect real-time environmental data ; and ( c ) to assess real-time and a posteriori damages , data that would be useful for understanding the phenomenon and its consequences .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
There are still many areas in which research has to provide additional tools to enhance reforestation activities , including ( i ) systematic evaluation of reforestation needs ; ( ii ) better matching of the site and types of reforestation ; ( iii ) improvement of technologies designed for arid regions , greater international scientific cooperation between the countries concerned being of particular importance ; ( iv ) taking into account and using local knowledge and technologies .  
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
98 A series of instructional and educational meetings were held between October 1994 and June 1995 for young lawyers from Siracusa and a number of local conferences and one national seminar were held during the period under review , dealing with numerous aspects of criminal justice , including the role of justice of the peace and penal procedural matters ( priority theme C ) .  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
The continuing presence of the international civilian personnel and local staff in the mission area during the withdrawal period is required to provide uninterrupted administrative support to the contingents and to ensure the recovery , collection , disposal and shipment of the United Nations-owned and leased assets , hand-over of rented premises , and settlement of commercial contracts and agreements with the local vendors . 
In the area of public administration , programme activities focus on strengthening administrative and organizational systems at both the central and local levels , improving management methods and practices through modern management techniques and information technology , and legal frameworks and programmes that are sensitive to the global economy .  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
The increase in the cost of spare parts , repairs and maintenance is attributable to frequent vehicle breakdowns caused by mountainous terrain , rough road conditions in the Mission area , dispersed locations of outstations , inadequate local availability of spare parts and mechanical skill .  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
In addition to the common staff costs for international and local staff which were calculated based on standard scales , provision is also made for the repatriation of 80 international staff at the end of the Mission at the rate of $ 1,400 per person inclusive an allowance for 100 kilograms of unaccompanied excess baggage ( $ 112,000 ) . 
While endeavouring to achieve maximum efficiency in the restructuring of the Division , equal consideration was given to the need to strengthen selected areas of administration and support services in the light of prevailing operational demands experienced by the Mission . 31 .  The Committee , in paragraph 18 of its report , requested that a review be undertaken of the requirements of the Public Information Section for 36 posts ( 25 international and 11 local ) .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
There is also a need to provide a selected number of centres with portable recording and radio feed equipment that can help them relay radio news to local broadcasters as well as transmit to Headquarters material gathered in their respective regions .  Recommendation 5 , Diversifying DPI audiovisual materials .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
It is essential to define , at the national , regional and local levels , a family support programme that is based on the principle of equal sharing of family responsibilities and is consistent with the policies for promoting equality in the labour market and protecting the rights of the child .  
This responsibility is reflected in the adoption of an integrated approach at the local and national levels in order to ensure access to affordable and reliable services for the children and dependants ( particularly those who are elderly and disabled ) of women and men who are working , undergoing training , studying or seeking employment .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
In addition , at the local community level around mine-sites , companies are providing enhancement to existing schooling programmes , health-care programmes - both medical and dental , including preventative care programmes and support through provision of social workers and also providing physical infrastructure such as water-wells , schools , health clinics and recreational facilities .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Cooperation and assistance can take a variety of forms , including joint ventures with local entrepreneurs in mining and the provision of ancillary supplies and services ; initiating complementary work and marketing relationships with indigenous small-scale producers ; lending expertise to both the Government and producers ; voluntarily returning marginal or small deposits to the national mineral inventory ; and joint or sole sponsoring of demonstration projects , training programmes or mining schools .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .  The present report takes into consideration the results of discussions held at the fourth session of the Commission .  
Undertaking research on effective systems and procedures in public administration , with particular attention devoted to the civil service systems , administrative structures and administrative reorganization , decentralization , aid management , accountability , financial management , metropolitan and local governance , approaches to rehabilitation and reconstruction of government and administrative services in post-conflict situations , and to ensure the timely distribution of these research results to Member States ;  
Such tools , revised to suit the local legal system and local practice , could be used at the regional and national levels and could form the basis for joint activities with other relevant international organizations .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
At its 1st plenary meeting , on 5 February , after the representative of the United States of America raised a question to which the Chairman responded , the Preparatory Committee accredited to the Conference , and its preparatory process the international associations of local authorities listed in A / CONF . 165 / PC . 3 / 2 / Add . 2 ( see annex I , decision 3 / 2 ) .  
To that end , the inventory of effective strategies , approaches , projects and programmes to reduce illicit demand and supply maintained by the Programme will be improved and expanded , and effective countermeasures tailored to local conditions against drug abuse , cultivation of illicit crops and drug trafficking will be developed .  
From a water allocation perspective , water in aquifers and rivers has to be shared on three complementary levels : ( a ) local sharing between water-dependent sectors and users ( households , industries , irrigated agriculture ) ; ( b ) urban / rural sharing ; and ( c ) upstream / downstream sharing by sequential reuse .  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities , sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly where State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , innovative privatization plans should be devised so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions previously performed ;  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
The driving forces behind increasingly serious water problems include rapid world population growth - in terms of both rapid urbanization and rural populations growing beyond local carrying capacity - and rising expectations and dependence on reliable water-related services to meet social needs , economic activity and food production .  
During the visit , I was able to meet with the local political leadership and express support for those who seek to implement the Peace Agreement and its vision of a single multi-ethnic country , two entities peacefully coexisting and elections that are free and fair .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
Two maternal and child health / family planning projects , implemented by UNRWA in coordination with local Palestinian non-governmental organizations , made considerable progress in improving the quality of antenatal care and providing postnatal care .  
The identification of the multiple actors ( United Nations , bilaterals , multilaterals , donors , non-governmental organizations , government authorities , beneficiaries , etc . ) and multiple levels ( international , regional , national , local ) engaged in humanitarian assistance response and the appropriate coordination mechanisms for these complex interactions will be addressed .  
It is also increasingly recognized by disaster-prone country authorities and by many donors that a larger proportion of international assistance should be focused on addressing the root causes of disaster , through suitably adapted prevention and preparedness programmes which maximize the mobilization of national and especially local community resources , drawing upon the skills and expertise of all relevant regional and international agencies .  
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the second half of June 1996 .  
That had made it possible to implement policies which were better adapted to local conditions in the areas of health and education , particularly in the provinces of the North and the Iles Loyaut , controlled by the FLNKS , which had succeeded in catching up to a considerable extent in the areas of infrastructure and public services , and achieving major progress in the economic sphere .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the first half of July 1996 .  
At national , subnational and local levels capacity-building is a key objective for several reasons : ( a ) forest management action is effected at these levels , ( b ) many countries do not have the institutional capacity to design and to implement strategies for the management of their forest resources , and ( c ) FAO and other international organizations concerned depend for their data collection on information that countries have already collected for their own purposes .  
Through the application of a relational and multidisciplinary database , a selection of economic , cultural and social variables is linked to the biophysical condition of forest resources in selected sites at the local level where periodic assessments are conducted to also observe the dynamics of change .  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
In areas where plantations are designed to achieve multiple purposes , especially for fulfilling subsistence needs of local populations , methodologies have to become more efficient and designed to reinforce the process of expanding forest cover .  NULLSeveral initiatives at the regional level have taken place or are planned for the near future in connection with improving the readiness to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
In some rural areas , when police officers refused to deploy to outlying districts , citing lack of facilities and logistical problems , judicial and other local authorities frequently improvised by relying on locally elected officials ( CASEC ) or unofficial communal police , who sometimes worked in collaboration with HNP to carry out police duties .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
On 25 July , at around 4.30 p.m . local time in Bujumbura , my Special Representative , Mr . Marc Faguy , was informed that the armed forces had put in power a presidential candidate of their choice , deployed heavily armed units , set up roadblocks across the city and moved into the national television station .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
Faced with an increasingly heavy reliance on temporary assistance for Conference Services , resulting from growing workloads and decreasing established resources , and more recently with substantially reduced appropriations for this budget item , the Secretariat has endeavoured to maximize the use of local freelance staff and avoid payment of costly travel expenses and daily subsistence allowances , in addition to salaries . 
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The full value of forests , wooded lands and trees and their contribution to social , economic and environmental well-being at the local , national , regional and global levels must be recognized .  
The process should build on national capacity and be based on the following characteristics , considering the situation of each country : well defined linkages to macro-level policies and policy processes ; closely linked cross-sectoral policies and issues , particularly land-use policies ; high-level political commitment and broad-based support ; participatory and decentralized planning approaches , including the use of local knowledge ; and identification and management of conflicts between relevant actors .  
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
The field office in Sarajevo was originally conceived of as a small liaison office intended , among other things , to provide support to the investigation teams , to perform liaison functions with local and national Governments and organizations in the area and to provide expert legal advice on republican and federal law in the former Yugoslavia . Following the Dayton Accord , and the increased investigative activity in the region , the critical need for increased support for the investigation teams became immediately apparent .  
These included changing mandates and constant uncertainties in the Mission , delays in budgetary authorization , delays in issuing budgetary allotments , cumbersome and inflexible procurement procedures , lack of experienced United Nations staff , frequent rotation of military personnel , difficulty in integrating military and civilian components and intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status of forces agreements . 
International and local observers take the view that principal responsibility for the continuing insecurity lies with the local police , who are either unable or unwilling to take effective action against the ongoing wave of criminal activity against the Croatian Serbs .  
Set against these positive signs are the unhelpful attitude of some hardline elements in the local Serb leadership , continuing uncertainty over the duration of the mandate of UNTAES , the need to resolve certain major policy issues if elections are to be held in February or March 1997 and questions concerning reliable assurances from the Government of Croatia for the preservation of a multi-ethnic society once the UNTAES mission ends .  
The general population 's lack of income-earning opportunities and low purchasing power , combined with increasing prices and decreased availability of basic goods on local markets , have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
There have been financial losses of some $ 890-million owing to the non-implementation of letters of credit in , for example , the importation of ready-made clothing and shoes , milk and other baby food , electric and other domestic appliances , spare parts , home and office furniture , and other essential goods imported from abroad to meet the consumption needs of the local market ;  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
On instructions from my Government , and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which Israel engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place during the second half of July and in August 1996 .  
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
At the Social Summit , Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rested with national Governments , with the support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society , including private citizens .  
The International Council on Social Welfare , made up of a wide range of local , national and international organizations with special interests on issues related to social welfare and social development , adopted Summit follow-up as its top priority and held regional follow-up seminars for non-governmental organizations in Africa , Asia Pacific , Latin America and Europe .  
The United Nations is the main international organization requested by Governments to undertake tasks such as facilitating dialogue between warring parties , preventing renewal of internal armed conflict , strengthening infrastructure , improving local security and facilitating electoral processes .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
The 124 national reports received by the Habitat II secretariat confirm that national planning processes generally adhered to this pattern , including representatives of national ministries , public and parastatal organizations , local authorities , the scientific and academic community , professional organizations , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the private sector .  
Because the United Nations system plays a predominantly supporting and facilitating role in shelter and settlements development , the substantive content of the follow-up by the United Nations system to Habitat II will be guided by national and local priorities for assistance , as outlined in the national reports and as further developed by the national mechanisms recommended in the Habitat Agenda .  
At the same time , the possibilities of financial support from non-traditional sources of funding , which have been opened up by the new partnerships established by the Habitat secretariat with , among others , the organized private sector , private foundations and municipal and local authorities , will be actively pursued by the Centre . D . Involvement of local authorities and civil society ,  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  NULLFinally , UNIFIL continued to make every effort to ensure security and protection of its staff :  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of document A / 50 / 363 / Add . 4 that , as proposed by the Secretary-General in paragraph 35 of his report to the Security Council ( S / 1996 / 416 ) , some of the existing UNMIH contingents remained in Haiti and that the revised cost estimates for the liquidation provides for the repatriation of 538 military personnel and contingent-owned equipment and for 8 international staff and 28 local staff for the closing of the base camp in Cap Ha \ x { 9ba0 } ien .  
Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
The relationship between the military and prostitution has been illustrated by cases of soldiers paying for the sexual services of orphaned , abandoned or displaced girls , who are often held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off-duty local soldiers .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
The revised cost estimates for the maintenance of the Observer Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 represented a 47 per cent reduction in the previous estimate , due to the reduced staffing level , comprising 34 military observers , 43 international staff and 47 local staff , and the non-implementation of disarmament and demobilization programme .  
Organizations of civil society are often flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
At independence , social security coverage extended only to established civil servants and established staff of administrative public institutions , local public authorities , staff of some public enterprises and some categories of employee in the structuralized private sector ( family allowances scheme , contractual retirement plan ) .  
Many delegations , while supporting in general the proposals for contributions by host governments towards local office costs ( GLOC ) , requested additional information regarding the financial impact of the proposals , in particular the financial impact of applying the revised programme thresholds for providing international staff to some net contributor countries ( NCCs ) , and the impact of the three-year waiver period following graduation .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The Plan focuses on stimulating and supporting national and local activities and initiatives and is built upon the idea of a partnership between Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations , professional associations , individuals and wide sectors of civil society .  
They should also be charged with raising funds ; channelling international and regional inputs , information and support to the local and grass-roots levels in their respective countries and coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade ; and reporting to the High Commissioner on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade .  
The training packages will incorporate the methodological approach mentioned in paragraph 75 of the Plan of Action , and address the following professional groups : prison officers ; primary and secondary schoolteachers ; legal professionals ( judges and lawyers ) ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; media ; and human rights monitors .  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
A colloquium organized by the Department in Warsaw in May 1996 on metropolitan and municipal governance focused on strategic planning and administrative change at the local level , including capacity-building , to support government 's new role as a facilitator of market-led economies .  
His delegation welcomed the fact that 155 out of 193 countries had already prepared national programmes of action , either in final or draft form ; the national programmes of action should be based on regional and local realities , such as historical and cultural factors and differing levels of development and capacity , in order to enhance the possibilities of achieving the targeted goals . 
The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
Those included activities using the education for development approach in the areas of advocacy and training ; research studies by the International Child Development Centre in Florence , Italy ; workshops that addressed issues of religious , ethnic and cultural discrimination ; and dissemination of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the public in numerous local languages .  
Are convinced that sustainable development and the utilization of solar energy would be enhanced by local and national capacity-building , policy reform and technology-sharing among nations , with an emphasis on coherent efforts towards technology acquisition and development in the developing countries . 
In addition , the authorities have repeatedly stated their commitment to equality and non-discrimination , and it was apparent in the discussions of the Representative with government officials at both the central and local level that they were making efforts to ensure that the law was being applied to persons of all ethnic groups in an equal manner .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
However , some of the remaining internally displaced persons informed the Representative that they received almost daily visits from local officials , telling them that they were no longer entitled to live in public buildings and threatening them with eviction .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Key components of administrative modernization and local government reform programmes are : the reorganization of civil service personnel administration and the delegation of authority for human resources management to the provincial governments ; the revision of civil service pay , career and incentive structures to enable the Government to recruit and retain qualified staff ; the design and implementation of an integrated public administration training system ;  
During the 1996 CG meeting donors ' interventions were characterized by three " leitmotifs " or central themes : need for greater government accountability ( as opposed to mere statements of good intentions ) and improved governance , most importantly to combat corruption ; need for more rapid economic growth to reduce poverty , through boosting supply response ; and need for deepening the democratization process , through in particular multi-party local elections .  
Those constraints included the numerous changes in its mandate , as well as other uncertainties in its operating environment , delays in budgetary authorization , cumbersome and inflexible procurement practices and procedures , a lack of experienced United Nations staff , the frequent rotation of personnel , the difficulty of integrating military and civilian components , and the intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status-of-forces agreements .  
His delegation supported the continuing decentralization of functions which , in particular , increased managerial responsibility at the local level , and agreed that delegated management authority must be accompanied by delegated financial authority , subject , however , to the overall authority of the Office of Human Resources Management . 
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
On 7 October , as part of regular consultations , the Transitional Administrator met with President Slobodan Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , who expressed full support for UNTAES , undertook to meet with local hardline Serb leaders to urge them to cooperate with UNTAES and stated his wish to see an extension of the mandate for an additional year .  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .  
With respect to article 4 of the Convention , and in the light of the current difficult economic situation , the Committee emphasizes the importance of the allocation of resources to the maximum extent possible for the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights of the child at both central and local levels , in accordance with the principles of the Convention , in particular those relating to non-discrimination and the best interests of the child ( arts . 2 and 3 ) .  
The Committee is also concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in the areas covered by the Convention , as well as between central and local authorities .  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
Despite the negative effect of the financial situation of the United Nations , as pointed out by the Assistant Secretary-General for Public Information , great progress had been made in improving the work of the Department and innovating when implementing its programmes , thanks no doubt to its links with educational institutions , think tanks and national and local governmental institutions , as well as international media organizations .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
The recent Administrative Decentralization Act provided a mechanism for indigenous and peasant communities to make their needs known to the central Government through local governments ; other legal measures had brought indigenous people into the national social security system and formalized their territorial rights .  
Training camps for foreign Muslim extremists , originally intended for the organization of violent actions outside the Sudan , were now being used , owing to the weakening of the State and to international pressure , for domestic repression alien to local Islamic traditions .  
The attacks are alleged to result from the central Government 's official policy imposing " its truth regarding Islam on an erroneous local version of Islam " and therefore to have religious legitimacy , as demonstrated by , inter alia , the fatwa of April 1992 ( see para .  122 ) .  
Sudan Airways carries thousands of elderly patients suffering from intractable diseases such as cancer , liver failure , heart disease and arterial diseases on a weekly basis to London , Cairo , Amman and Jedda on travel tickets that are discounted by 50 per cent and are paid for in local currency .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Planning to meet requirements and the design and erection of decent and socially acceptable lodgings represents an extremely complex and expensive task inasmuch as , to cope with the problem of refugees arriving in unpredictable numbers , with major peaks , account has to be taken of economic possibilities and of the limited land areas and premises available , while also avoiding conflicts with the population and among the refugees themselves and taking into consideration local political interests .  
The departmental coordination unit to combat racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , set up within each departmental council for the prevention of delinquency under the circular issued by the Prime Minister to the prefects on 1 March 1993 , meets at least once a year to monitor problems of racism , initiate warning procedures , if necessary , collect information on local criminal policy , promote the amicable settlement of disputes and , in the light of particular local characteristics , propose measures to strengthen social cohesiveness . 
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;

While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .

These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
The pivotal role of regional organizations in democratizing development should be enhanced by opening channels to the regional level for the views of those at the local level , and by reducing bureaucratic obstacles to the flow or volume of assistance ; the United Nations regional economic and social commissions are well placed to contribute to such an effort .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .

The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened ; the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated ; while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .

The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .

In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national and international programmes and projects for the Year and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
The Assembly appealed to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in science and technology of developing countries , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
The Assembly welcomed the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments5 on the report of the Special Representative , to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections were free and fair , that members of the armed forces remained neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote was confidential and that local and international observers were welcomed .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
In addition to delaying or denying entry visas , initial work permits and internal travel permits to international non-governmental organizations , the Government also attempted to introduce new uncompetitive bidding procedures for local food procurement by obliging humanitarian agencies to purchase food through government parastatals .  
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
The secretariat convened five international expert working groups to study aspects of early-warning as they relate to geological hazards , hydrometeorlogical hazards including drought , technological hazards , the use and transfer of modern technology , and national and local capabilities pertinent to early-warning .  
Subsequently , the importance of managing wildfire hazards became the dominant policy promoted through the collaborating interests of public authorities , commercial interests and local commitments driven by a combination of balanced economic , social and ecological values .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
These require organizational structures , information flows and decision-making protocols capable of acting effectively at both national and local levels to monitor and forecast hazards at those levels , and to generate risk scenarios that can indicate the potential impacts of an impending hazard event on specifically identified vulnerable groups and sectors .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
The projects evaluated were selected through a weighted combination of such criteria as innovative design for formulation of public policies , relevance of project strategies for programme areas and sub-offices , emerging priorities ( e.g . , child labour , AIDS ) , potential for intersectoral integration , a child rights framework , national and local impact and replicability and sustainability of results .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to contribute to the creation of an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , and broad-based programmes of human rights education , and strengthening of local non-governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
An average of 96 groundsmen and cleaners were employed under special service agreements to clean a maximum of 88 military locations at a monthly payment equivalent to the lowest grade provided for in the established local salary scales ( $ 915 per month ) .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 , 1994 and , more recently , in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building of developing countries in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
That conditionality must be perceived in a positive light : those who cooperate in good faith in the implementation of the Agreement , whether at the central , local or municipal level , can be assured of our support .  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
The regulation on certain issues of State information policy of January 1996 , mentioned above , in addition to specifications regarding registration , placed the regional and district press under the direct control of the local political administration , with local executive committees being empowered to approve editors-in _ chief who themselves become members of the committees .

Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Those included : exposures from natural sources of radiation ; exposures from man-made sources of radiation ; medical radiation exposures ; occupational radiation exposures ; dose assessment methodologies ; epidemiological evaluation of radiation-induced cancer ; deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair and mutagenesis ; hereditary effects of radiation ; combined effects of radiation and other agents ; models , mechanisms and uncertainties at low doses ; and local exposures and effects of the Chernobyl accident .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Considering that parliamentarians can contribute substantially to sustainable development by promoting legislative changes , improving public policy and strengthening institutions for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda2 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements13 at the local , national , regional and international levels ,

The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
We are not opposed to the moderate liberalization of markets regulated by international trade in order to prevent negative effects on sensitive sectors of local economies , but we are opposed to those who preach freedom of trade for some and then systematically avoid it for themselves as they see fit .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
While it is important to act with determination and caution , on the one hand , it is , on the other , vital to know how to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can support emerging models , consolidating the global and intersectoral dimension of youth policies in close coordination with national , regional and local authorities while not ignoring the various social actors , including young people .  
The people and Government of Jamaica have long recognized that small businesses , which incorporate small-scale enterprises , micro-enterprises and cooperatives , have the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and social and economic development .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
In addition to taking preventive action , the High Commissioner is seeking to take action regarding durable solutions , such as attempting to create an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad-based programmes of human rights education , as well as the strengthening of local non-governmental organizations .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .

The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete .

However , their situation at the regional , national and local levels has worsened as they confront increased discrimination regarding their economic , social , civil and cultural rights .  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
The Guidelines also elaborate various environmental measures in relation to UNHCR activities , which include ; consideration of the carrying capacity of the local environment and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas in site selection and camp planning ; promotion of energy-saving stoves , energy saving cooking methods ; economic and educational programmes designed to reduce fuelwood collection ; and controlled fuelwood harvesting .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
Other objectives include the provision of timely and authoritative information by the Spokesman for the Secretary-General to media representatives , the provision of timely and adaptable information materials through the United Nations information centres to meet regional and local needs , the establishment of an international broadcasting system and monitoring of international trends and events as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the Organization and the Secretary-General by major media networks .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Gross and massive violations of human rights can be committed by local State bodies and officials , too , but the danger of such violations increases immeasurably when they are committed by , for example , a parliament passing racist laws , or a ministerial cabinet conducting a repressive policy .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
In light of the Committees view that further efforts are required to ensure that the Convention is used as a political tool and a framework for action on behalf of children , the Committee recommends that future national and local programmes of action on children incorporate policies , programmes , aims and goals reflecting the principles and provisions of the Convention .  
The Committee also suggests that a multidisciplinary monitoring and coordinating system be established to assess the progress achieved and difficulties encountered in the realization of the rights recognized by the Convention at the national and local levels , paying particular attention to the adverse effects of economic policies on children .  
With regard to the follow-up to Habitat II , ACC , at its first regular session for 1997 , decided that the arrangements should focus on supporting country-level action and coordination and should involve the development of guidelines to orient the resident coordinator system in establishing country-level thematic groups and strengthening implementation and monitoring at the national and local level .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The SRCF will be used for : ( i ) financing assistance to governments and regional / subregional bodies in the national , subregional and regional action programming ; ( ii ) financing assistance for the preparation of local area development programmes ( LADPs ) that respond to National Action Programmes , bearing in mind also the dual track approach for LADPs and NAPs that some countries might envisage ; and ( iii ) catalytic financing for National Desertification Funds , designed within the context of National Action Programmes . 22 .  Finance for civil society .  
In addition , recognizing the imperative of a conducive policy environment for participation of resource users in conservation and sustainable management of natural resources , the Fund has launched a comprehensive programme of studies to examine pertinent policy and institutional issues at the national and local levels .  
Governments should focus on being enabling partners and facilitators by creating and strengthening effective partnerships with a broad spectrum of national and grass-roots groups including local authorities , the private sector , non-governmental organizations , women 's and youth groups and the scientific and academic communities .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
Indeed , while we applaud the recognition granted to local government in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 , the two pages in that Chapter hardly reflect the immense financial , infrastructure , administrative and governmental contribution of local Governments to the green and brown agendas or to the agendas of the North and South .  
Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
In its resolution 1992 / 50 on the fraudulent or unlawful enrichment of top State officials , the Commission on Human Rights pointed clearly to the responsibility of the North in connection with the commission of that crime in the countries of the South and thus raised the question , still unclear in international law , of the restitution to despoiled peoples , for reinvestment in local economic , social and cultural development , of the funds which their leaders have extorted from them , usually with the complicity of foreign banks .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
Convinced also that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking , and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievement and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals , and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
Requests Governments , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations and the specialized agencies , actively to support local , national and international initiatives , including the development of human rights indicators , aimed at assessing and improving the housing and living conditions of women throughout the world , in full consultation with and with the full participation of women themselves , their representatives and community _ based non _ governmental organizations and other relevant groups ;  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
In order to implement the recommendations made at the Fourth World Conference on Women , Lebanon had established a national committee on women 's matters which was responsible for coordination with the official authorities , both central and local , and with non-governmental organizations of the League of Arab States at the level of the Arab countries , and with intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and its specialized agencies at the international level .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
The centres would develop train the trainer programmes to train peace promoters in the region concerned and to monitor and support their peace promotion work on a long-term basis , producing ultimately a diverse and flexible network of peace promoters around the world , connected by modern communication technology , for the exchange of information and experience in building a culture of peace at the local and regional level .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
As the Council underlined , the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration is the full cooperation of the Government of Croatia , which bears the ultimate responsibility for convincing the local population that their reintegration is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible .  
It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
Information centres are an essential partner in this effort , whether establishing strong working relationships with the local media and responding to their inquiries ; cooperating with civil society and other local partners to promote major United Nations themes ; disseminating the Department 's products , such as booklets , brochures or United Nations radio and video programmes ; maintaining reference libraries ; translating the Department 's material into local languages ; servicing visits of the Secretary-General and other senior officials to their host countries ; or maintaining liaison with Governments .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
To tackle illicit cultivation in Afghanistan effectively and to sever trafficking routes flowing from that country will require a major - and sustained - investment by the international community coupled with the commitment of local authorities to enforce a ban on opium poppy cultivation as a condition of participation in alternative development activities .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .  
Assessments are required continuously , to guide rational and effective decision-making for environmental policy formulation , implementation and evaluation at local , national , regional and global levels .  
One approach is to reduce traditional backward and forward linkages to the local economy to a minimum by not promoting economic growth and its attendant service and administrative infrastructure at the site of production .  
The recent increase in mineral investment in developing economies provides an opportunity to develop creative partnerships at the local level to integrate mine development into a wider regional strategy for improving economic and social conditions .  
The development of cost-effective , meaningful and useful methods for the regular assessment , monitoring and review of the environmental performance of industry at the local , national , regional and global levels is urgently required .  
With the encroachment of agriculture on natural or quasi-natural ecosystems , plant and animal genetic resources are being lost , modern cultivars are replacing local ones and intensive livestock production systems are developing .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
Action at the global level and action at the regional , national and local levels should be consistent with each other and based on common norms .  
The purpose of the Social Incentive Fund is to provide a comprehensive and concerted approach at the local level to the numerous problems involved in improvement of the urban living environment .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
Particularly in the social field , advisory services and group training proved to be the most effective means to reach local governments and grass-roots people , including the urban and rural poor , women , children , youth , the aged and the handicapped .  
The Government has launched a major programme of reforming the public sector aimed at improving the capacity for efficient service delivery , devolving administrative power from the centre and increasing democratic participation in local government .  
There is , however , a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
By supporting democratically accountable local governments , UNCDF has demonstrated that civil society can be empowered and the local private sector stimulated to participate in poverty reduction .  
That meeting intended to forge firm partnerships on five key issues : global economic commerce ; biotrade , for the benefit of indigenous and local communities ; commercial diplomacy ; risk management of commodities , and microcredit .  
One was to reject everything that was foreign , on the reasoning that each countrys situation was unique and that external influences tended to be irrelevant at best or to undermine local uniqueness and cultural identity at worst .  
Other environmental health risks such as unsafe uses of lead , tobacco and ambient and indoor air pollution need to be adequately addressed in local , national and regional preventive strategies with a view to reducing their potential effects .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
As training materials needed to reflect a rapidly changing technology and specific local conditions , they had to be both flexible and based on simple principles with wide and durable applicability .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
Another indigenous representative from Oceania recognized that , despite difficulties , some progress had been made in indigenous health conditions and that traditional cultural , social and spiritual needs were addressed in close cooperation with local groups .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
There is a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
The majority of the reports indicate social / cultural benefits , including active involvement of local communities , increased public awareness , and maintenance of natural heritage and historical sites , as well as cleaner air .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
With the sporadic outbreak of local conflicts , the excessive accumulations of small arms and light weapons have not only had direct human costs , but also brought immeasurable social and economic dislocation .  
To eliminate the need to import expensive ready-made prosthetic components from abroad , ICRC has introduced new materials and developed special moulds to facilitate low-cost production at the local or regional level .  
It should be designed to meet critical urgent needs , as well as the long-term requirements essential for the development of a sustainable national / local capacity , when applicable .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
Other training and reference materials in the pipeline are : a training manual for primary and secondary school teachers ; a training manual for national and local NGOs ; a handbook for parliamentarians ; a trainers guide for military peacekeepers , a training manual for the treatment of victims of domestic violence for the police ; and a handbook on human rights and constitutions .  
These would involve transferring genocide cases falling within categories 3 and 4 , and possibly also 2 , 12 / to this local communal level of traditional justice , where locally elected and respected members of the community would preside over cases involving other members charged with these offences .  
The cost of three additional staff under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1-D-2 , 1 General Service and 1 local ) were absorbed within approved resources , as reported to the Advisory Committee in a letter from the Controller dated 11 February 1998 .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Progress in achieving sustainable forest management will depend on effective integration and coordination of local , national , regional and international actions related to these topics in addition to main economic instruments , such as direct economic incentives ( subsidies and charges ) , tax policies , resource rent capture and regulation of land tenure .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to a variety of global environmental systems , it is important to consider the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy demands for goods and other services .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
However , considering the value of these forests to local populations , it will be difficult to adequately identify quality changes , especially change in species composition and biological diversity , which is mostly induced by the common practice of selective cutting of highly valuable trees .  
I would emphasize here , without wanting to be too critical , an occasional lack of understanding in the implementation of adopted policies ; a pernicious role played by local personnel ; supporters of those in power being recruited by the international organizations ; a perceived lack of sensitivity on the part of those who were in charge of certain political and diplomatic aspects ; and perhaps too frequent personnel turnover .  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
Governments and relevant international and regional organizations have been encouraged to conduct case studies , and communicate these to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on the impacts of intellectual property rights on the achievement of the objectives of the Convention , including relationships between intellectual property rights and the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities ( decisions III / 14 and III / 17 of the Conference of Parties ) .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
The periodic humanitarian assistance in the form of food , clothing , footwear and medicines given by international and local charitable organizations , small enterprises and farms also plays an important role in aiding the needy , the elderly , the disabled , residential institutions and orphans .  
They were decided without consultation with the provincial authorities , local populations , or international and non-governmental organizations engaged in development work in the province , and without any adequate social and environmental impact assessment studies .  
The activities undertaken to mark the anniversary by Governments , international and regional organizations and , most notably , by civil society at all levels - local , national , regional and international _ have also provided clear evidence of a reinvigorated commitment to human rights as the common principles which should unite the international community as a new century begins . 
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
In concluding his presentation to the Committee , Mr . Otunnu pointed out that his programme of work for 1999 involved a series of initiatives at the country , regional and international levels which focused on developing public advocacy , strengthening international standards and local values , establishing concrete initiatives in the midst of ongoing conflict , and mobilizing concerted responses to post-conflict needs .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
It should be noted that , in this dispute , in which a number of workers were dismissed , workers who refused to stop supporting the ad hoc committee that had been set up or to renounce their intention to join the local union were prevented from entering the plantations , giving rise to declarations of illegal strikes and unwarranted dismissals , the verification of which revealed procedural irregularities .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note that the Government sought outside , non-governmental expertise to : ( i ) develop a coherent policy and strategy for domestic violence ; ( ii ) propose a set of legal measures ; and ( iii ) implement a framework for training local staff .  
Not only had India taken institutional , legal and educational measures to strengthen the role of women at the political level , but it had also taken affirmative action to ensure that women filled one third of the seats in all elected local , village and municipal bodies , thereby providing them with the opportunity to exert influence in the formal structures of economic , political and social decision-making .  
Small businesses had the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and scientific and technological expertise and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and economic and social development .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
For other atrocities , documentary evidence that directly implicates individuals , whether at the senior governmental level or the regional or local level , is currently not available and may never be found given the uneven nature of record-keeping in Democratic Kampuchea and the apparent loss of many documents since 1979 .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
Daily and weekly dissemination on tape , via satellite and / or shortwave broadcasting , telephone feeds and as sound files on the Internet to participating radio organizations in all regions of the world for local , national , regional and international broadcasting ( News and Media Division ) ; ii .  
This resulted primarily from the upward revision of local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent , effective 1 March 1997 , and the delayed liquidation of obligations no longer required , which could not be identified and cancelled in time before the closing of the accounts .  
Additional requirements of $ 1,991,900 are recorded under civilian personnel costs , due to various developments such as the unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries , noted in paragraph 27 above ; as well as the delayed termination / separation of individual local contractors employed under special service agreements ( SSA ) , and of local staff hired as general temporary assistance whose contracts expired beyond 30 June 1997 .

Recognizes the importance , for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , of a multifaceted approach at the local , national , regional and global levels , as well as of the continued involvement of major groups , as defined in Agenda 21 , and calls for the preparations for the 10-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups ;  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
These benefits were exchanged for performance standards related to export targets , local content requirements , debt-equity ratio ceilings , national ownership floors , operating scale minima , investment timetable obligations , regional location criteria and , eventually , product quality specifications and environmental rules .  
Second , policy standards , which tie subsidies to the promotion of major national strategic priorities , such as maintaining price stability , increasing local content , raising the level of exports and not worsening income distribution .  
In 1998 , the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity had recommended that member States should adopt a draft model legislation on access to biological resources at national level ; initiate a process of negotiation among African countries to adopt an African convention on biological diversity ; and develop a common position to safeguard their sovereign rights and the vital interests of local communities .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;

Strongly supports the efforts made to enable the people of Haiti to express their political will in the forthcoming legislative and local elections , invites all the political leaders of the country to involve themselves in a constructive dialogue , and in this connection , invites the Government of Haiti to ensure the necessary political and security environment for the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the schedule recently announced by the Provisional Electoral Council ;  
Estimates of the number of militia fluctuate for a variety of reasons : some minor leaders and some of the rank and file are returning to East Timor ; militia are often collocated with local West Timorese and displaced persons , making it difficult to distinguish between the two ; with some militia involved in criminal activity , their identity as a pro-integration group is becoming blurred ; and significant elements of the militia leadership appear to be reviewing their plans for the future .  
As mentioned in my last report ( S / 1999 / 987 ) , UNMIK has also established other consultative mechanisms through which the local population and leadership have been able to participate in the decision-making of the interim administration by providing expert guidance and advice to UNMIK on specific issues , for example in the fields of legislative matters , humanitarian affairs , economic policy , health , education , energy and public utilities .  
The expert group agreed that the Ombudsman Institute would be set up primarily to protect the rights and freedoms of all legal entities in Kosovo , by monitoring the activity of the Interim Civil Administration and emerging local institutions prior to and following provisional elections .  
Promotes the sharing and transfer of experience through the monitoring of human settlements indicators and learning from best practices in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels and feeds back the lessons learned and experiences gained in improving human settlements conditions at the country level into global policy development processes ;  
Commission resolution 1997 / 50 spells out the revised mandate of the Group , which is to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily , provided that no final decision has been taken in such cases by local courts in conformity with domestic law , with the standards set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and with the relevant international instruments accepted by the States concerned .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
With respect to procurement by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals in excess of $ 50 , 000 but less than $ 200 , 000 ( or the specifically delegated monetary procurement limit , if it is less ) , any such procurement action must first be submitted to the applicable local Committee on Contracts for advice to , and , if satisfactory , approval by , the Chief Administrative Officer , the Chief of Administration or other applicable head of office .  
Reaffirms that voluntary repatriation , local integration and resettlement are the traditional solutions for refugees and that all remain viable and important responses to refugee situations ; reiterates that voluntary repatriation , where and when feasible , remains the preferred solution in the majority of refugee situations ; and notes that a combination of solutions , taking into account the specific circumstances of each refugee situation , can help achieve lasting solutions ;  
Among the activities promoted by local and regional authorities , labour unions and non-governmental organizations were international and national conferences on the issues associated with ageing , ranging from broad cultural and social debates to more focused discussions of the specific economic , medical and psychological concerns of the elderly .  
It is important to note that , in resolving the problem of social protection for the elderly , local executive and administrative organs have cooperated very closely with public organizations for veterans and the disabled , the charitable fund , the committees of the Red Cross and trade unions .  
The main purpose of these conferences , held with the direct and active participation of young people , was to raise the general publics awareness of the goals set and the commitments undertaken by Governments , to promote dialogue with the decision makers on follow-ups and to encourage an active involvement of young people , civil society and the local governments in the implementation of the relevant national plans of action .  
My country is fully convinced that States play a great role in activating social development at the local level and in creating an enabling environment , thus implementing the Copenhagen commitments by placing social development on a strong foundation of human rights , non-discrimination , pursuit of equal opportunities and the realization of social justice .  
This policy would open the economy to market forces while at the same time restoring the valuable contribution of social action ; it would be geared to a gradual reduction of the imbalances and inequities of our current reality and to the transformation of relations between the State and civil society ; it would promote greater participation of communities in development efforts at the local and regional levels .  
Does anyone in this Hall believe that they might read on the Internet or in a newspaper in the foreseeable future that a South-East Asian country has requested or received a mandate from the Security Council to intervene , without the consent of the White House , in a civil conflict in Michigan that the White House has been unable to control , a conflict resulting from wild actions of the famous local militias ? 
Though national and local approaches to the problem of mine clearance have existed for decades , millions of landmines and other unexploded ordnance are still buried in the soil or scattered on the surface in over 60 countries around the world , and thousands of innocent people are being killed or injured every day .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
Where globalization has adverse effects on the provision of an access to social services for all , these effects need to be addressed by positive measures at the local , national , regional and international levels in order to minimize them and to promote social development .  
Invites concerned non-governmental organizations , funding sources and the private sector , in coordination with national authorities concerned , to support and develop a programme that will bring a wide range of expertise and proven interventions , including alternative community-based services , to the training of local community workers , teachers and primary health care staff and to provide appropriate interventions for stress-related disorders to girls and women in crisis ;  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
Promoting broad-based sustainable development through tourism while safeguarding the integrity of local cultures and protecting the environment requires an effective partnership between key stakeholders at the local , national , regional and international levels and participation at all levels of tourism planning , development and assessment .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
For rural areas not connected to grids , sustained programmes of investment in decentralized rural energy schemes , based on an efficient use of renewable energy sources , where reasonable , should be launched , with the incremental cost of such schemes to be met , where necessary from regional and global sources , to meet local demands for energy services .  
Although economic instruments are primarily applied at the national and local levels , they can be adapted in an efficient manner at the regional and international levels .  
Of the estimated 3.1-billion people in rural areas , approximately 2-billion have no access to electricity and about the same number of people rely on traditional energy sources for cooking , such as wood , charcoal and animal and plant wastes , which are associated with adverse environmental effects at the local level .  
Policies for rural development and rural energy policies should be developed and implemented in a mutually reinforcing way and appropriate government agencies within the responsible ministry for national energy policy should be assigned specific duty for rural energy , in some cases at the local or provincial levels .  
The positive engagement with the natural resource base is essential not only to maintain local and national food security but also to offer opportunities for balanced rural development .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of procedures to serve as alternatives to formal criminal justice proceedings and to formulate mediation and restorative justice policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation and restorative justice among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
With regard to the development and diffusion of biotechnology , it was emphasized that , while national level research and development efforts were critical in order to ensure , among other things , that local conditions were taken into account , knowledge-sharing through North-South and South-South partnership and networking and regional initiatives were crucial for effective transfer and diffusion of technology .  
Young women and men should therefore be involved from childhood in decisions relating to their own lives , and step by step in democratic decisions for their school , their community , in local national social and cultural organizations as well as at the national , regional and international levels .  
Recent international meetings on population issues , including the high-level regional meeting concerning Asia and the Pacific that had been held recently in Bangkok , had contributed to the establishment of the political commitment needed to integrate developmental , population and environmental strategies at global , regional , national and local levels .  
With regard to the Secretary-Generals report on the implementation of the outcome of the Istanbul Conference ( A 53-267 ) , which stated in particular that the special session of the General Assembly should review the specific contributions of different partners to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the national and local levels , he observed that Governments , employers and workers , all of whom were represented in ILO , had played an active role in preparing the Conference . 
The 1992 amendments confirmed Moroccos support for the principles , rights and obligations deriving from the Charters of the international organizations it has joined and its commitment to universally accepted human rights principles , established the region as a local community , transformed the Constitutional Chamber into the Constitutional Council and raised the Economic and Social Council to the status of constitutional body .  
Accordingly , Moroccos health policy addresses five main concerns : a ) more effective mobilization and use of resources ; b ) the building of a new relationship between the public and private sectors regarding health matters ; c ) streamlined management and regulation of the overall health care system ; d ) improved services with control of spending ; and e ) participation by local communities .  
In implementation of high royal instructions placing rural areas at the heart of governmental strategy , in the framework of the policy enabling all citizens to participate in cultural life and to contribute to the improvement of rural living conditions , and with a view to improving the geographical distribution of cultural services and facilities , the Ministry of Culture has initiated , in cooperation with local communities , an extensive programme to build and equip libraries in rural centres .  
These consultative bodies , comprising representatives of all the social partners concerned ( local communities , cultural associations and unions , private and banking sector , personalities from the arts and literature , etc . ) , constitute a genuine forum for debating cultural policy and determining the direction and priorities of cultural actions . 
In order to ensure the creation of the necessary framework conducive to foreign investment and to private sector participation in maritime transport , it is essential to harmonize regulatory instruments at least at the regional level , and to exploit existing opportunities for cooperation which could enable both local and foreign operators to access maritime markets more easily and ensure the competitiveness of small island developing States operators .  
Although there were average monthly vacancy rates of 4.9 per cent for international staff and 6.9 per cent for local staff ( see annex III to the present report ) , additional requirements under local staff salaries and common staff costs were necessary due to the unforeseen retroactive increase of 12.5 per cent in local staff salaries effective from 1 January 1997 .  
Moreover , in the case of securitization of mortgage loans , an assignment against the consumer-debtor may materially increase the burden of risk imposed on the consumer-debtor ( if , e.g . , the mortgage loan is assigned by the friendly local savings and loans bank to a foreign lender , who may be more aggressive in the collection of the outstanding amounts of the loan or in handling any variable interest rate ) .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes requires the deployment of substantial resources that exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
A number of people stressed that incidents which had come to light often thanks to the watchfulness of local associations and NGOs like Greenpeace International , might represent only a tiny percentage of the waste and products which are banned from import , but which are smuggled into the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean and buried there illegally .  
The projection provides for the retention in MINURCA of 1 , 350 military personnel , inclusive of the 35 additional military personnel referred to in paragraph 44 of my main report , and 25 civilian police advisers , supported by 179 international and local staff .  
For instance , when local arts and crafts and cultural practices are adapted to suit foreign tastes , the result can be poor quality handicrafts , unethical trading practices and fake antiques , as well as the deterioration of cultural dances , music and festivals .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism . 
While it is evident that there is a continued need for the international community to support the strengthening of national and local capacities in terms of health _ care expertise , infrastructure and supplies , it is also incumbent upon the national and local authorities to do their part to ensure that what is in principle free access to State _ sponsored medical services actually exists in practice .  
In order to ensure the effective dissemination and promotion of the Guiding Principles , participants agreed that international humanitarian organizations and national NGOs should facilitate the organization of local _ level workshops on the issue of internal displacement in general and on the application of the Guiding Principles in particular .  
The additional requirement of $ 1 , 991 , 900 under this heading resulted primarily from paying an unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent effective on 1 March 1997 and the delayed termination separation of individual local contractors under special service agreements and local staff hired as general temporary assistance based on their actual contract expiration dates , which were mostly in July or August of 1997 , rather than 30 June 1997 .  
The Bah International Community , with over five-million members from all strata of society organized as approximately 17 , 000 local communities and 175 national and regional communities , is committed to peace and engaged in a wide range of activities.These activities include but are not limited to fostering grass-roots participation in sustainable development initiatives , advancing the status of women , eliminating racism , and promoting and protecting human rights . 
Most efforts on integrated coastal area management , though technically innovative and successful in various cases , have evolved at the local level , leaving them isolated from the mainstream of national development planning ; furthermore , such efforts have not attracted substantial funding , making the initiatives less effective than they could be ;  
Building adequate manpower with the requisite level of skill for effective integrated island management ; small island developing States should assess their training needs and develop a training programme , involving the private sector , non-governmental organizations and Governments ; training should not be limited to technical experts ; it should include local communities , for example , fishermen , tourist hotel operators , managers of industries located in coastal regions and farmers ;  
This would include ( i ) documentation of traditional ethnobiological knowledge , including identification of ecosystems , species and genetic types that are endangered or in short supply at the community level ; ( ii ) factors responsible for their endangerment , and actions that can be taken to address the situation ; and ( iii ) identification of knowledgeable persons who should be formally recognized and made integral participants in biodiversity conservation at the national and local levels .  
In Mauritius , a national environmental commission has been set up , chaired by the Prime Minister , with a broad membership , including ministers responsible for economic planning , finance , education , science and technology , energy and natural resources , tourism , industry , health and justice , and representatives of local government .  
In several small island developing States that have established or upgraded institutions charged with resource conservation and environmental protection , inadequate national budgets have seriously limited the scope of their operations ; even in situations where local expertise exists for dealing with environmental protection and resource management problems , shortages of funds hinder adequate action .  
The project consists of two components : ( a ) a Jakarta component to achieve better waste management through both solid and liquid monitoring activities , educational activities for students and local people , community-based waste recycling and composting activities ; ( b ) a Pulau Seribu islands component with coral reef monitoring activities , scientific research , educational activities for local fishermen and alternative income activities for women and fishermen .  
The final resolution of the Conference stated that it is crucial to ensure access to all relevant information for the public , to involve local and regional authorities and the public in decision _ making and to seek public confidence in principles that govern the safety of repositories and in waste management programmes ( for the proceedings of the Conference , see the Council of Europe series Studies and Texts , No . 57 ) .  
Moreover , the increasing participation of local communities in tourism development has encouraged modern structures of public administration as well as the sharing of joint responsibilities between public institutions and the private sector .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
To find the support it deserved , the ICC must be complementary to national criminal courts , intervening where local courts were unable or unwilling to act .  
In spite of the constraints encountered , many small island developing States have established initiatives to balance tourism activities with broader economic , social and environmental objectives at the regional , national and local levels .  
This can be achieved through direct government policies , joint ventures with local private initiatives , and foreign investment from regional and international public and private banks .  
With regard to the above , there have not been sufficient efforts or effective measures by the Government to replace the authoritarian components of its system of organization with the elementary principles characteristic of any pluralist and democratic society , this being most apparent at the middle levels of the State and particularly in local administrations .  
Such a conference would provide a forum for Ugandan religious leaders , parliamentarians , notables , local political and administrative leaders , non _ governmental organizations and associations to discuss the situation in northern Uganda , with a view to formulating a political platform conducive to the pacification of northern Uganda through participatory political processes and socio-economic rehabilitation .  
A reduced provision of $ 327 , 300 under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 144 person-months at the local level ) is required to meet the need for additional support during surges in activity at the Logistics Base .  
All Governments shall formulate integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels .  
The Act was accompanied by a decree _ law establishing local boards ( 324 nationwide ) to administer the guaranteed minimum wage ; they are a key element in what is an example of good governance on poverty in the developed world , grounded in the reinforcement of the local mutual aid network by linking official administrators with community organizations .  
That amendment also entitled any person , natural or juridical , to establish a periodical , a local radio station or a television studio , whereas the previous legislation recognized this right only for the State , social and economic organizations and for associations .  
To intensify efforts to raise awareness of and to mobilize international and national public opinion concerning the harmful effects of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls , including female genital mutilation , in particular through education , the dissemination of information , training , the media and local community meetings , in order to achieve the total elimination of these practices ;  
In these and other areas , there is a need for concerted efforts at the international level to provide small island developing States with access to technology on affordable terms , and to assist them in their efforts at establishing regional centres for capacity-building including training in the assessment of technologies as well as their management , technology negotiations and partnerships leading to technology transfer , and adaptation of available technology to local conditions .  
In view of their narrow natural resource base , their proneness to disruption by natural disasters , their small range of primary product exports and their limited local capital for productive investment , small island developing States need to join forces for their development , so that communication and exchange of information becomes vital .  
As a result of extensive media outreach and the dissemination of human rights information materials translated into local languages by UNICs , the Secretary-Generals Human Rights Day message was widely publicized , articles and commemorative newspaper supplements were published , public service announcements on the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration were broadcast , and Centre directors appeared on a number of radio and television programmes .  
In order to achieve the objectives described therein , the plan of operations for the Observer Mission headed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General , calls for the phased deployment , as security conditions permit , of the authorized strength of 70 military observers , a 15 - person medical unit and 5 civilian police advisers supported by 50 international civilian and 48 local staff .  
an increased commitment by Governments at the national and local levels , and their partners in civil society , to guide public and private investments for the provision of adequate shelter , basic infrastructure and services ;  
The special session to be held in the year 2001 will review progress made at national and local levels and will assess the appropriateness of mechanisms that have been established at national levels to coordinate and support the different activities set up by Governments at the national and local levels in cooperation with partners from civil society .  
At the local , national and regional levels , the organizational arrangements that were successfully and effectively utilized for the preparations for Habitat II will be refined and adapted to the requirements of the special session , with special emphasis on the inputs and participation of local authorities and other partners from civil society . 13.44 During the biennium 20002001 , the following outputs will be delivered : 
A policy catalogue and case book on the elements of good urban governance ; a report on normative standards and benchmarks for good urban governance ; a set of capacity-building manuals on urban governance structures and institutions at local levels ; a report on internal self-evaluation ; sets of modular media and information kits on urban governance ; enabling policy and strategy frameworks on good urban governance ; a report entitled World Charter of Local Self-Government ; ( iii ) Press releases .  
The main end-users of the outputs will be government authorities and officials of the countries of the region , especially those concerned with the planning and coordination of economic and social policies at the national , regional , State and local levels , as well as those carrying out planning , programming and management activities in other public bodies and enterprises .  
Provision of technical cooperation services , upon request , to countries of the region in connection with public-sector programming ; economic development and local management ; management of public territorial policies ; national public investment systems ; and integrated management of investment projects ; ( ii ) Group training .  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
Annual regional courses in connection with management of multiple uses of water , rights to water use and regulation of water-related public utility companies ; and the management of sustainable development at the local level ; ( iii ) Projects .  
Other users will include public and private agencies and bodies responsible for the design , execution and administration of programmes , policies and projects dealing with population-related issues and national , regional and local bureaux concerned with economic and social development .  
The project has contributed in a meaningful way to the training of national primary health care staff at the local level and has assisted civil society organizations in counselling , and has supported blood-screening activities in 11 HDI townships .  
The High Commissioner for Human Rights should , in collaboration with the Department of Public Information , the specialized agencies , regional intergovernmental organizations , interested States and non _ governmental organizations , study opportunities to establish a creative , inexpensive and efficient information strategy whose aim would be to reach people at the national and local levels .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
Where BDS are strategically important but not yet adapted to local needs , joint efforts by public and private institutions have proven effective institutional responses .  
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
International efforts , however , needed greater public support so that the public could join in the fight against drugs in all social institutions where values were formed , such as churches , schools and trade unions , and also within the relevant regional integration bodies so that the principle of shared responsibility could be brought to the most local , grass-roots level .  
The significant rise in FDI going to developed countries meant that developing countries would have to change their investment promotion strategies , going beyond the creation of a favourable legal investment framework - - which had virtually been achieved in the Latin American and Caribbean region - - to focus on policies aimed at improving such investment determinants as business facilitation , access to technology , and local technological capabilities.UNCTAD could be very helpful in that area . 
Strongly supports the efforts made to enable the people of Haiti to express their political will in the forthcoming legislative and local elections , invites all the political leaders of the country to involve themselves in a constructive dialogue and , in this connection , invites the Government of Haiti to ensure the necessary political and security environment for the holding of free and fair elections in accordance with the schedule recently announced by the Provisional Electoral Council ;  
To intensify efforts to raise awareness of and to mobilize international and national public opinion concerning the harmful effects of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls , including female genital mutilation , in particular through education , the dissemination of information , training , the media , the arts and local community meetings , in order to achieve the total elimination of these practices ;  
The estimates are based on the 1999 and 2000 standard salary costs for New York and the local salary scale applicable to the mission area and reflect the application of a projected vacancy rate of 20 per cent for international and local staff , as well as salary and common staff cost adjustments for 70 per cent of international staff classified as mission appointees .  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
He said he hoped the working group would be able to draft a declaration in which States were encouraged to consider a broad range of autonomy for indigenous groups in managing their local and internal affairs , including economic , social and cultural matters .  
Decentralization of authority and decision-making should be encouraged ; as decentralization proceeds , there is a need to increase local capacities ; policies are needed to promote economic empowerment , enhanced civil participation and increased human resources at the local or community level ; there is a compelling need to evaluate services on the basis of data received from service users at the community level ;  
The opening of many countries to global financial markets has created situations in which Governments , at both local and national levels , have new access to opportunities to borrow , yet many of the officials concerned have little or no experience with the workings of financial markets and no accurate concept of their abilities to repay the loans.This has led to numerous cases of potential public default or bankruptcy .  
In particular , the strong State would have to be reinvented applying the decentralized model of organization of the modern global corporation , with the local states taking a proactive role in wealth creation across the territory and the national State acting as strategic leader , consensus-builder and broker between the supranational and subnational levels .  
In addition to lacking sufficient local market knowledge , foreign firms may also be liable in their own country if they are prohibited from offering bribes by their national foreign bribery legislation or if their Governments have ratified international agreements such as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions .  
We know that this can only be done if all the people concerned , at the local , national , regional and international levels , are fully committed through joint and coordinated efforts and actions .  
The unique role of the community of nongovernmental organizations , at local , regional , national and international levels , in putting environmental issues on the agenda and promoting social innovation was recognized .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
While womens advancement is a globally accepted goal , it should also be recognized that prevailing conditions at the local level , whether social , political or economic , have a direct bearing on the pace at which this process evolves .  
This decentralized form of government has increased administration at the local level and proved to be the ideal way to ensure political participation from the grassroots to the uppermost levels .  
Efforts to promote cooperation and interface between ethnic communities at the local level , including the establishment of multiethnic municipal councils , administrative boards and rapidimpact employment projects , could foster peaceful coexistence .  
This is a mass organization , whose main functions are to help take care of the material and spiritual life of older persons and to engage them in the political , social and cultural activities of the local community .  
In Israel , public participation is considered crucial to the sound development of sustainable agriculture through linkages between government ministries , local authorities , the private sector , academic institutions and scientists .  
Since those elected bodies were instruments of local cell governments , responsible for plans for economic development and social justice , rural women could now play a leading role in shaping the destiny of their community .  
An international cooperative programme on integrated landuse planning and management should begin by taking stock of existing knowledge and local , national and international experience in a more systematic and detailed manner .

Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .  
Li Peng said : Since the standing committee was established in each of the local people 's congresses at and above the county level , local people 's congresses , holding legislative powers , and their standing committees have formulated a batch of local laws and regulations .  They have made a positive , catalytic contribution to the consummation of the socialist legal system and to promoting the development of various local causes .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that , as two ancient civilizations of the East and West , cultural exchanges between China and Greece are very lively .  Last year the Greek national theater put on the Greek tragedy " Medea " in Beijing , and the same play has been done on the stages of both countries in the form of a Chinese local opera from Hebei directed by Chinese , which was warmly received by the audiences .  
According a leading member of the State Civil Air Defense Office , as modern warfare principally is expressed in local hi-tech wars , nuclear and chemical protection is predicated on the safe use of the civil air defense engineering projects .  
Zhu Rongji stated that the State Council is going to organize a special force and , once an in-depth investigative study is completed , propose a plan for improving the social security system at the end of the year .  Once it is approved by the central authorities , it may be implemented on a trial basis in Liaoning first , while the other provinces and regions may select one or two local places and cities to implement pilot projects , promoting it comprehensively once we have obtained some experience .  
Meanwhile , we should also uphold the principle of suiting measures to local conditions and providing specific guidance for work in specific areas ; push forward the work in a positive and steady manner by means of taking cases of excellence as an example for the rest to follow , and by means of using the experience of selected units to promote work in the entire area ; and bring about a healthy and orderly development to the socialization of social welfare .  
Nowadays , professional national defense communications support service units in Xiamen are known to local army units and civilians as " strong and efficient support service teams out of the military establishment " that are " movable , available , and quick at fixing problems . "  
The teaching methods of the American military , besides the conventional military academy , also extend to continuing education universities , local branch academies , learning by mail , off-post paid study , continuing education technical institutes , and many other methods .  It is regulated that all military bases at the company level , or having over 750 soldiers , must establish a " troop training center " , be responsible for setting up an academy , and assist officers and soldiers to study at local academies .  
In upholding the new thinking of running schools with an open-minded spirit , we should make the following efforts : We should gear education of military academies toward society , dovetail it with the state 's higher education , learn from the reform experiences gained by local universities , extensively carry out cooperative exchanges , rely on the solid strength of local colleges and universities , and cultivate military officers through joint efforts made by military and civil sectors .  
Party committees and local government at all levels in Guangdong should make efforts to profoundly understand General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important conception of " three represents " in connection with Guangdong 's specific conditions , continue to advance reforms and opening-up , strive to move in the forefront of developing the advanced productive force , and push ahead socialist modernization .  
ensure social stability at the grassroots level , ensure the security of grassroots political power , and ensure normal local economic and social development .  By achieving these we will make new and greater contributions to the acceleration of the development of democracy and the legal system at the grassroots level , to the implementation of the basic strategy of ruling the country by law , and to the accelerated construction of a socialist state ruled by law .  
We should carry out and implement the Program from the heightened perspective of strategy and the overall situation , should understand at a profound level the important significance of emphasizing the construction of command automation for accelerating our military 's modernization construction and for winning high-tech wars , should strengthen our sense of mission and sense of urgency , should conscientiously follow the principle that local interests are subordinate to overall interests and current interests are subordinate to future interests , and should improve the construction 's overall effectiveness and benefit .  
With the great support of the local port administration and experts concerned , this reserve division has researched and built a roll-on connecting bridge , thus opening up a passageway for the troops to load and unload their heavy equipment on sea .  This division has received favorable comment from the troops participating in the drill .  
Officers and men of a certain group army that is stationed in the great northwestern region have completed theoretical study by understanding the strategic significance of the large-scale development of the western region from the vantage point of adhering to the party 's basic line , and have become more conscientious in their actions to support local economic construction .  
Bearing in mind Dandong 's key antichemical warfare work targets , the antichemical warfare detachment of the local troops conducted the exploratory drill to counter possible direct or indirect use of chemical weapons by the enemy in future warfare .  
The restriction on projects on which restriction must be imposed can also be appropriately relaxed so long as such projects are conducive to the development of the western region and do not affect local environmental protection or the overall situation of national economic construction .  
Local party committees are responsible to the central leading body and shoulder the responsibility for comprehensively leading local political , economic , cultural , and social development .  
It is necessary to concentrate on properly solving major strategic issues having a bearing on the overall situation with foresight , correctly control the political orientation for major policy decisions and major personnel arrangements , do effective work in conducting propaganda and education , effectively maintain social stability , pool efforts of all sides and lead mass organizations , reinforce leadership politically , ideologically , and organizationally over the whole municipality 's work , and guarantee the correct implementation of the party 's theory , line , principles , and policies in the local area .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
Controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned is an important component of the efforts that the local party committees should make to maintain , reinforce , and improve the party 's leadership .  Only by continuously improving itself , and making efforts to improve the mode of its leadership , can a local party committee really ascent a higher plain to look farther ahead and give thought to things more deeply ; and only thus can it better play a role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level .  
and the rate of urban alarm coverage has touched 98 percent in key PAD cities .  They successively conducted surveys of economic mobilization potential and organized economic mobilization drills in relevant counties ( cities ) of four provinces ( autonomous regions ) and conducted throughout the army the first exploration of the issue of peacetime-to-wartime switchover of local campaign corps .  
In local war , one strictly selects military and non-military targets and employs the most accurate and " humane " attack .  This tactic itself shows the political nature and purpose of war , but more and more economic targets of the other side with war potential will be included in targets for attack by firepower .  
Today the international political situation is becoming multi-polarized and revolutionary innovations have emerged in international military sectors .  Our military bases its fundamental preparation for military struggle in winning local wars under the conditions of modern technology , especially high tech conditions .  The priority of military production is changing from quantity to quality and labor-based to technology-based methods .  
In future local wars , the boundaries between strategy , operation , and tactics are vague , making the identification of operation and strategic networks even more difficult .  Strategic information , operation information , and tactical information will flow orderly in an integrated network environment , and display the characteristics of close inter-linked and integration .  
The city transferred a number of cadres with knowledge about industrial and urban development from city-level organs to work in suburban counties ; as a result , knowledge of local party and government leaders has been diversified , their average age was five years younger , and their average educational level has been raised , which has effectively boosted local economic work .  
The main cause is the intervention of local protectionism and other non-market factors , which have enabled some home electrical appliance enterprises which have lost their competitiveness and survival ability to survive and keep on operating under the protective umbrella of administrative intervention , which , in turn , has prevented resources that have been excessively invested in this industry from smoothly withdrawing from competition .  
A new tactics research team organized by the detachment has thoroughly analyzed the carrier battle group with respect to its tactical organization , electronic early warning system , sonar system , fire control system , and the performances of its high-tech equipment ; drawn experience from the high-tech local war fought in recent years in the world , and followed the trends of tactical and technological development ; and made repeated comparisons between the enemy and ourselves in terms of technology and equipment , and found out each other 's strength and weakness .  
Educational activities directed at certain targets , defining certain content , and organized around a relative focus , such as winter training for Party members , basic level Party schools , political schools for workers , night schools for peasants , theory study groups for young people , local educational institutes , and various types of training groups , etc .  
Many localities give prominence to special characteristics , conduct propaganda to suit local needs , and expand inputs , and have formed certain principal fronts for ideological and political work , including a public opinion front , a training front , and a cultural entertainment front .  
Originally he planned on staying a night in the United States and expanding his impetus and influence and gaining political capital by publicly meeting US pro-Taiwan congressmen and local overseas Chinese ; the United States , however , was worried that it would get into a deadlock with China , and stressed that during his stopover the new leader " can not have any public agenda " .  
Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should help military cadres ' families who were laid off because their enterprises gone bankrupt or suspended production .  Enterprises or local labor and social security departments should follow relevant policies and regulations to protect their basic livelihood condition .  Meanwhile , they should provide them with free professional guidance at least once in a year and free employment recommendation three times a year .  
For military cadres ' families who can not find employment for reasons other than personal one , labor and social security departments can allow them to pay , on a voluntary basis , basic pension insurance fees in accordance with a ratio based on local average wage .  Their pension insurance records can be kept at local employment service organizations .  In addition , they can enjoy exemption or reduction of various management fees .  
In the local wars that are likely to take place in the future , our military must fully take into consideration the combat power of our military and the demand of a set strategic goal , and strive to achieve the goal of " winning " at a relatively small price when it comes to making a choice regarding the pattern of a firepower combat at the strategic level .  
The Beijing Military Representatives Bureau has cooperated with five national defense departments of five provinces and cities in northern China , as well as local colleges , universities and scientific research institutes in establishing regional cooperative relations with multiple layers and professions and formed a new pattern of developing military products and scientific research by leaps and bounds .  
As to making our civil air defense project construction more efficient , the government and military sectors need to make the building of underground bomb shelters a key part of urban construction , insisting on " mostly construction " .  We need to set growth rates in line with local realities to build a number of underground bomb shelters and integrated peacetime-wartime projects suited to new tactical and technical needs .  
We should seize the opportunity , meet challenges , lay stress on the key points , suit our measures to local conditions , grasp the key link and principal contradiction , concentrate our efforts on solving outstanding problems concerning the overall situation in the development of the region , and speed up the region 's economic and social development .  
There will be 4% growth in total local productivity ; at the same time , the government of the special administrative region is trying to improve the investment environment progressively and trying to make the economic rules better and more complete .  They are raising the administrative efficiency and opening the cellular phone and web connection markets to strengthen the desire to invest from inside Macao and outside of Macao .  
In the course of advancing their work in the key fields , trade unions at all levels actively assisted the party organizations and the local governments in doing effective ideological and political work among the working masses , carried out " economic and technical innovation projects " among the working masses , organized and guided workers to enhance their work skills , learn from the advanced , do a first-class job , and make greater contributions .  All this played a positive role in the course of fulfilling the across-the-board tasks of the party and the state .  
Therefore , the central and western regions can not simply copy the policies of the coastal regions if they are to achieve breakthroughs and greater development in attracting foreign investment .  They must take measures that are suited to the local conditions , give play to their own unique strengths , pioneer new ideas and new models , and adopt more active and effective measures to further open up to the outside .  
To make these means and methods be specific , systematic , and scientific , we must give full consideration to the characteristics of military personnel and the feasibility of these means and methods under current conditions .  We must handle correctly the relationship between " theme " and " variety , " and we must uphold the relationship between the special nature of the Armed Forces and the borrowing of successful local experiences .  Efforts toward structural innovations must move forward along the correct path .  
However , some local criminal and vicious groups are rapidly developing and their activities are becoming more and more vicious in recent years .  They have been using extremely cruel measures , which seriously undermine public security in society .  They have gradually become destructive and harmful criminal groups of Mafia nature .  
Discussing the current work of taking stock of and straightening out " state investments , " Dai Xianglong revealed that in the past one or two years the central bank has held frequent consultations with local governments on the question of straightening out trust and investment companies , because the great majority of these companies , apart from a few , are the equity controlling or total investment companies of the local governments .  
State-owned enterprises in cities must transfer all primary and secondary schools , hospitals , and other social service organizations to unified planning and management by local governments .  For some time , funding needed for this purpose will be jointly shared by both the enterprise and the government before it is gradually transferred in its entirety to the government .  Some of the organizations can be transformed into commercial operations .  
It was reported that the circulation line of US nuclear attack submarine has the problem of metal embrittlement and so it has been criticized by the people .  If nuclear submarines are reinforced in Japan , local people are expected to show objections .  Therefore , Guam has become the best choice of the US military .  
In the political sphere described by Putin as the " crux of Russia 's rejuvenation , " Russia has , by means of the Federal Constitution , straightened out the relations between the central authorities and various republics , oblasts , and border regions ; curbed the separatist tendency of local regimes ; and severely cracked down on the separatist attempt by illegal armed groups in Chechenya , initially restoring a powerful state power system .  
Power struggle between local officials , plenipotentiaries directly commissioned by the President to federate regions , and central administrative institutions may arise from time to time .  In particular , the establishment of peace in Chechenya and the shaping of its future will remain a longstanding headache for Russia .  
Under the leadership of local party committee and government and with the support of the broad masses of the people , public security organs at various places have carried forward the spirit of brave fight and persistent battle , hit hard , moved toward a good beginning of the special target struggle on " hitting the mob and eliminating devils , " and obtained preliminary results .

They also formulated plans for a real army-civilian joint mine-sweeping drill , organized and completed a map inference for joint mine-sweeping operations .  
In addition , local governments at all levels must ensure the formulated , detailed rules are beneficial to implementing interim procedures , reinforcing national defense and military construction , appropriately resettling demobilized military cadres , and boosting economic and social development .  
I propose that military units stationed in western China should be authorized to take special preferential measures for retaining and attracting useful personnel .  There should be stronger leadership over the programs by which military and civilian authorities will support each other and work together in promoting the construction of a civil society ; and the military should support local economic construction projects with its advantages in terms of personnel , technical , and information .  
In compliance with the trend in history and by giving account to Hong Kong 's situation and interests , the central authorities set forth the important principles of " one country , two systems , " " Hong Kong being governed by local people , " and a high degree of autonomy in Hong Kong . This is aimed at maintaining Hong Kong 's existing commodity city model in the operation of the market economy and enabling Hong Kong to continue to play an important role as a major trading port .  
In view of the need for developing military science research in the new century , the " regulations " summarize and draw on the successful experience of our army in military science research , emphasize the need to focus military science research on defense construction , army building , and preparations for military struggles in the new situation , conduct perspective study on the issue of winning a local war under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , and thus provide powerful theoretical support for the military 's modernization drive .  
Ever since it was activated , a networked information system built by the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security has played a key role in intensifying a series of specialized struggles waged by the public security organs across the country , including " pursuing fugitives " , " cracking down on abductors " , " striking at triad activities and weeding out local tyrants " , and so on .  
Shortly afterwards , the local public security organs at all levels downloaded all sorts of information relating to the prime suspect from a specialized website created by the Ministry of Public Security , so that the broad masses of public security officers and men involved in this struggle quickly learned all details and accurate information relating to the prime suspect and information relating to investigations into the case as well , and this provided solid support for cracking the vicious " 16 March " explosion case in Shijiazhuang City .  
Over the past few years , the public security organs have adopted resolute measures to " strike at triad activities or weed out local tyrants ; " have ruthlessly cracked down on all types of illegal or criminal activities by cracking one batch of major or serious cases after another or rounding up in the net of law one criminal guilty of flagrant crimes after another ; and have thereby upheld justice , deterred crimes , or maintained social stability .  
As radical nationalism in itself is just an operational platform for speech , it must be combined with other ism values in order to assume the state of actual political operation .  In terms of contemporary China , the ideology or ism the most capable of functioning well on the platform of nationalism is exactly leftist radicalism ; such a leftist current of thought , revitalized through being combined with radical nationalism , will acquire momentum in terms of " being able to command the local lords in the name of the emperor . "  
The local planning , finance , agricultural , supervision , audit , grain , statistical , and quality and technological supervision departments and branches of the Agricultural Development Bank and branches of the Central Grain Reserve Company and other departments and units must take a step further to strengthen cooperation and coordination , give full play to their respective functions and roles , and work hard to make sure that proper personnel are assigned , that the work is done , and that the responsibilities are fulfilled .  
After our entry into the WTO , we must take advantage of the restrictions of increased production costs and insufficient resources for agricultural products in certain developed countries and regions and seek favorable opportunities to invest and build production bases abroad , further expand our force in attracting foreign agricultural business and capital , actively improve the agricultural investment environment and draw up agricultural policy in line with local conditions to attract investment by foreign business , and attract foreign business to invest in and operate agricultural enterprises as well as participate in comprehensive agricultural development in China .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
must perform well , under the unifiedleadership of the local party committees , governments , and public securityorgans , the work of administering or managing public order in areas under theirrespective jurisdiction ; and must continually step up infrastructure buildingat the grassroots level , work hard to raise the standard of law enforcement , strictly enforce the law , warmly provide services , and strive to attain such awork goal as " fewer crimes , good order , social stability , and satisfactionamong the masses . "  
Liang Guoju , director of the provincial Public Security Department of Guangdong , called a special teleconference the other day to lay out tasks for public security organs throughout the province ; meanwhile , he urged all localities across the province to publicize in the coming few days each 's results in the comprehensive management of local social security , including the number of criminal rings of an underworld triad nature and the number of suspects that each locality had successfully smashed and arrested .  
In some places , there are activities of using smuggling and producing fake products as a way to become rich and the dangerous situation of linking crimes of smuggling and manufacturing fake products with local and personal interests .  Some people even protect those who have been engaged in smuggling or producing fake products and create artificial obstacles to " cracking down on smuggling and manufacturing fake products " at the cost of state and overall interests .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
At present , according to the arrangements of the State Council , actions should be focused on cracking down on the activities of making and selling counterfeit commodities , regularizing the construction market , punishing criminal offenders involved in tax evasion and tax frauds , breaking departmental monopoly and local blockade , straightening out the market for cultural products , thus laying a good foundation for the fundamental improvement of the order of the market economy in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
In this special fight against the evil forces , local authorities , party and government departments , and law enforcement authorities at all levels must work with one mind and with firm resolve .  While we must take quick , thunderbolt-like actions to rebuff the brazenness of the evil forces , we must also take thorough and careful moves to smash the protective shelters that harbor these evil forces so as to completely destroy their structures and cut their poisonous vines in our society .  
The Standing Committee has also made a assessment of how administrative organs , judicial organs , and procuratorial organs carried out administration according to law and how the corporate law is implemented and an assessment of the work reports submitted by the cadres , who are selected and appointed by local people 's congresses , on how they discharged their legal functions and powers , enforced laws , and did official duties honestly and diligently .

Robert Wilson , a thermonuclear weapons expert at Princeton University , warned that the US military has simply got dizzy , as there can not be any such thing as a nuclear weapon that can destroy enemy underground bunkers without threatening the local inhabitants .  
The meeting required that party committees and organization departments at all levels should further unify thinking , enhance understanding , improve the style of work , effectively guarantee the fulfillment of the assignments , seize the opportune moment when local leading bodes at various levels will be changed , and raise the work of selecting , promoting , and training young cadres to a new level .  
It has been learned that the major tasks of these coordination centers are : to coordinate work in handling legal issues involving units under the General Staff Headquarters , their servicemen and servicemen 's family members and to assist local governments and judicial departments as well as provincial military districts and sub-districts and the people 's armed forces departments of respective provinces to properly handle in good time legal issues involving the military and local people and to provide legal service for military units , servicemen , and servicemen 's family members .  
To actively provide effective services for readjusting the rural economic structure and increasing peasants ' income , the vast number of rural grassroots cadres should study in depth the conspicuous contradictions in local agriculture and the rural economic structure , get their ideas into shape , draw up and perfect plans for structural readjustment and economic development in the light of local conditions , and go from village to village , household to household to properly determine measures for readjusting the economic structure and increasing income .  
has stepped up scientific and technological input in building a local network linking up its joint command center with its various county , township , and town bureaus for national defense mobilization purposes ; and has thus built a rapid mobilization system .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
We must insist on putting the military economy in the context of the national economy and combining strategic logistical construction with local infrastructure construction .  In the construction of railroads , highway , airport , docks , telecommunications , pipelines , urban construction and other basic construction , we must take into consideration the military needs and make sure they can be taken care with little or no extra spending .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
After the 1980s , advanced technology has been used in conducting geological investigation and research , such as global satellite positioning , GPS monitoring system , and aeronautical remote sensing technique , which has led to the establishment of the datum net for GPS monitoring in the reservoir area of the Three Gorges Project , and GPS net for monitoring local deformity .  
All localities , in the light of local situations , should clearly set the objectives , focus on key tasks , and strive to achieve practical results .  We should not only decidedly wipe out criminal forces and pressure groups already uncovered , but also should expose criminal forces and pressure groups that have been lying low and have not been exposed and clamp down on them .  
Article 2 .  When the principal leaders of local people 's governments , or the chief responsible persons of relevant government departments , who , according to the law and administrative regulations , are found to have neglected their duties , or committed misconduct in performing their official duties , or should be held accountable for their poor leadership with respect to preventing the occurrence of the following extraordinarily serious safety incidents shall be disciplined .

Instead , they should raise questions based on their local conditions and solve the questions in a way suited to their local conditions .  On the one hand , they should not act too fast .  Rather , they should focus on one or two striking questions in practical work as a starting point , press ahead step by step , and develop their work in the course of progress .  
For those regions where the rectification work is slack , market economic order is chaotic , and efforts to improve the situation have proved ineffective after a long period of time , those local government officials who are primarily responsible as well as relevant responsible persons must be held accountable in accordance with laws and disciplinary rules ; those who have committed crimes must be investigated on criminal grounds in accordance with the law .  
Wherever blockades are organized and superior goods from outside are unable to enter , the consumers there can only buy inferior local products , and so their interests are damaged , while the protected inferior enterprises have no intention of improving themselves , and are ultimately bound to be mercilessly knocked out in market competition ;  
The work organs of national defense education at the provincial , prefectural , and county levels in all parts of the country should , under the unified leadership of the local national defense education committees and national defense education leading groups , and effectively perform the functions of organizing , guiding , coordinating , and inspecting national defense education work in their administrative areas .  
Local institutions for national defense education at provincial , prefectural , and county levels should conscientiously perform their duty of organizing , guiding , coordinating , and inspecting the work on national defense education within their own administrative divisions , under the unified leadership of the local committees for national defense education or leading groups for national defense education .

"  Because of this , it has regarded anti-jamming and anti-magnetic mobile telecommunications , the formation of an overall network , and rush repairs as key training points .  It has set up a local area network for equipment management , a radio monitoring network , and so on .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .

His journey to the forefront of the local arts scene started 20 years ago , when Chang Ta-chien , one of the most famous traditional Chinese painters , held an art exhibition Taipei .

Since the oil shock , the price of textile raw materials has skyrocketed , and meanwhile the people 's living standards were rising , resulting in higher labor costs . The developed countries protected their domestic textile industries with import quotas . Moreover , the ROC had been concentrating on the low-priced market . As such less-developed areas as the Philippines , India and Mainland China took advantage of very low labor costs and local resources , the competition grew .  
Visitors had come from all around the world to witness the opening of the largest fine arts museum in the Far East , as well as to view the ten scheduled opening exhibitions , which included a selection of international prints and the works of overseas and local Chinese artists .

The waters surrounding the peninsula abound in coral reefs , and the geology of the region has been greatly shaped by the action of wind and wave erosion . Coral rocks in interesting shapes lie scattered along the coast , and local residents have given them appropriate names , such as Shihniushan ( stone buffalo mountain ) and Ch'ing-washih ( frog rock ) . Maobitou ( cats nose ) and Oluanbi are the two most famous tourist spots in the national park region .  
People must be educated to appreciate the importance of environmental protection , Shih Meng-hsuing stressed , if the ideals of the national park concept are to be realized . People in Taiwan , he explained , lack concern for preservation of natural resources ; both tourists and local residents indiscriminately pocket shells and coral and carry off rare plant and animal life . The thoughtless littering of park and beach areas is also a serious problem which could lead to serious damage , especially to those more sensitive areas like the fragile coral reefs .  
Situated at the confluence of three rivers in the southwest corner of Taipei County , Sanhsia is an area rich in both history and natural scenery . Once a flourishing agricultural trade center and forty years ago a booming coal-mining town , Sanhsia has over the years been supported by the local tea industry and the commerce which the rivers bring . Today , one of the few places where Ching dynasty architecture and a traditional tea market ' can still be seen , Sanhsia offers much of historical significance to the visitor .

Manufacturers generally have been in the role of supplying larger foreign companies and have prospered as their buyers have prospered . However , this strategy has its limits , particularly in the area of independent product development , and Taiwan has not used its own research potential .

Later , an incarnation of Chang Hsun came looking for an appropriate site for a temple and settled on Anhsifu . A local official inspected the area and felt that the cave there would produce phoenixes , an omen meaning that someone living in the area was destined to become famous . The phoenixes , therefore , must not be allowed to escape , and the official ordered that a stone pillar be placed on the " phoenix 's wing . "  
People from points south flocked there to do business , making it second only to P'ingtung itself as a commercial center . The town became the central market for farmers to sell their red beans , betel nuts , coconuts , and other local specialities , from where they were sold wholesale to other markets .  
Many importing countries , strapped by foreign debt , pay particularly close attention to the terms and amount proposed by bidders . In 1979 the ROC government established the Export-Import Bank to assist local makers , granting long-term repayment schedules at low interest rates . In addition , should a foreign customer fail to make good on his payments , the bank will reimburse the Chinese firm and take legal action overseas to recover the debt .  
If local people are responsible for some mistake , a foreign administrator had best not make an issue of it in public , or the perceived assault is liable to boomerang as one is labelled a " racist . "  
In the late 1970 ' s the local film scene acquired a new look . The Motion Picture Development Foundation film library , founded in 1978 with the support of the Government Information Office , began to systematically introduce famous European films and top-notch local works to its members . And starting in 1980 , an international film festival has been held every year in conjunction with the Golden Horse Awards to show foreign art films ( together with some high-standard commercial films ) nominated for the awards .  
Along with the growth in Taiwan 's economy , a rise in the general level of culture , and an increase in international contacts , many local Chinese have come to appreciate the charm of Chinese-style furniture from foreign friends , while others , having enjoyed all the products of Western civilization , have simply stopped to ask themselves : When even our last spiritual stronghold - - the home - - has become completely Westernized , is there anything left that 's special about being Chinese ?  
As a result , all the trivial chores of running an embassy - - showing slides , cooking and serving dinner , fixing toilets , paying the water bills - - have to be handled by the ambassador and one or two assistants , in addition to their major duties of keeping themselves informed of the local situation , negotiating with local officials , and serving overseas nationals .  
The Taiwan Photographic Society , whose motto was realism with a local color , and the Photographic Society of China , whose rallying cry was salon pictorialism , represented the two main streams of photography on Taiwan during the 1960s and 70s . Because of differences in viewpoint , language , and thinking , the two groups moved in different circles of activity and engaged in different spheres of endeavor .  
We should accelerate the implementation of the reforms initiated by late Chairman Chiang Ching-kuo with an even more active and responsible attitude . From central to local government , from representative bodies to the administrative agencies , all should make a thorough self-review , based on actual needs , and strengthen and improve where required , to fortify the substance and function of democracy .  
The materials can be divided into several major categories : chia-ku wen remains ( oracular bone inscriptions ) , ancient artifacts , original editions , government documents from the Ming and Ching dynasties , local records , and modern historical documents .  
This includes the establishment of centers for folk arts and popular handicrafts in southern and eastern Taiwan . In the north , Chinese culture parks will be set up . And at the same time at least five large-scale museums will be added to the present number . Exhibition halls displaying the unique features of local and indigenous products will become part and parcel of the cultural centers of every county and town .  
The election also showed what might be a weakness in the KMT policy of priming its most elite members for central government offices , out of the desire to put the best brain power in decision-making positions concerning overall public policies . It now is evident that , while the ruling party focused its efforts on central government offices and overlooked the recruitment of candidates that can win in local elections , the DPP has launched its most elite manpower at the local level , especially in races for county magistrates and city mayors .  
Japan 's environmental movement has been joined by doctors , lawyers and experts in various fields who have helped to set up research and legal channels to follow and even to educate the local populace in environmental issues enabling disputes to be resolved within the system and at the same time raising environmental awareness . "  
Furthermore , based on the many years of experience we have accumulated in implementing our Constitution and on the needs arising from the current national environment , forward-looking and necessary revisions will be made to portions of the Constitution concerning such matters as the parliamentary organs of the central government , the system of local government , and government organization to provide the Chinese people with a legal code that is in accord with the trends of our times , and to establish a great model of political democracy for all times .  
Eventually people strung together some of the popular songs existing in the countryside , blending them in with plots from vernacular fiction and song-texts and inserting a few charming stage steps and movements derived from ch'e-ku and ts'ai-ch'a drama . The result was a new type of folk drama with a strong element of local color and the main emphasis on singing .  
Taiwanese folk opera is sung in the vernacular and is easy for the local community to understand . Its affecting stories of lovelorn suffering proved immensely appealing to farmers and fishermen whose simple lives otherwise offered little opportunity for leisure or recreational pastimes .  
If a local can under-take recording and explanatory fieldwork in advance it helps give a better insight into the subject , and the lack of obstacles to communication and understanding makes it easier for him to organize scattered and fragmentary materials and so arrive at more meaningful and detailed results . " This is how Wang Sung-shan , currently a research assistant at the National Science Museum , regards Ch'en Chien-ming 's role vis-a-vis other workers in the field .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations . How confident are you in succeeding ? '  
At the end of the Ch'ing , the port became obstructed by silt , and it lost its value as a port . The local center of activity shifted to Chunan . And when the railroad was built , it only stopped at Chunan , further isolating Chungkang .  
This year local commodity prices , which caused enough complaint before , have been affected by a " bad year " in terms of both natural and man-made disasters . Since the middle of August when Typhoon Yancy struck , Taiwan has weathered typhoons Abe and Dot in quick succession , causing enormous losses in farm produce .  
Some of the demands overlap with standard government regulations , but even more of them are based on special local needs , such as a requirement that the firm adhere to effluent standards higher than the national standard , that an environmental impact statement be drawn up , that an inspection team be set up , that the factory reach certain standards within a certain period of time or else be shut down .  
Premier Hau Pei-tsun has stated that the government wants to ensure a healthy stock market , not rescue it . The Ministry of Finance has also firmly turned down suggestions from certain deputies and businessmen to lower the securities transaction tax so as to stimulate a recovery in share prices . Instead , regulations are being revised to encourage financially sound companies to list their shares on the market and to allow foreign institutions to enter the market , as a viable means of nudging the local stock market towards full maturity .  
For supplementary legislators , oral interpellations only make up 3% of the total , with 97% being written interpellations . And ten percent of written interpellations are about local affairs , showing that some legislators still have n't settled themselves into being " national level " representatives .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , with people from the various provinces following close behind , the multifarious flavors of north and south China hit the ground running in Taiwan . Add to this the local native style , and you could say that this is the most fortuitous event in the history of Chinese food since somebody figured out how to make fire from rubbing sticks together in ancient times .  
American fast food came to Taiwan in 1984 in the shape of McDonald 's , whose first Taipei outlet achieved a record turnover for the worldwide chain in the first week of opening . They not only encouraged other Western fast food businesses to set up shop here , but also set the pace for local fast food outlets such as Chicken House , Ting Kua Kua and Han Hua , whose common features are based on McDonald 's example of clean , bright surroundings , hygienic food and speedy service with a smile .  
Yet there is still some justice in the world , and the contribution we make is increasingly recognized . In recent years , whenever construction projects have posed a threat to those of our kind that are a little on the senior side , or are curiously shaped , local people have stood up on our behalf and tried to save us . All Taiwan heard of the incident where conservationists rallied together to save the towering coconut trees from a road-widening scheme along the Pingtung-to-Kenting Highway .  
But the distribution of health resources is still not equal . Major urban areas have continually built public and private large scale hospitals , not only saturating the area , but also creating vicious competition . Whereas local and base levels have been ignored . This is something the government has to accept responsibility for .  
Arriving in what were then poor , backward countries such as Nigeria , the Philippines and Indonesia with her Western training and modern medical equipment , she found to her surprise that " age-old local traditional medicine provided the most economical and practical means of care for most people . " And this sparked her interest in studying traditional medicines round the world . "  
Strawberry picking has become a popular leisure activity for city dwellers , and no doubt many people have picked the big red " Taoyuan No . 1 " strawberries at some pick-your-own strawberry farm . This strawberry was developed in Japan and a Japanese patent has been applied for . Local growers also used to carry plants away lock , stock and barrel after they 'd featured in Dutch exhibitions in Taiwan aimed at opening up the local flower market .  
Three years ago she selected a suitably attractive area set against the hills , called Three Corner Lake , and harried the relevant local departments into building an activities center and restaurant there , for the reception of visitors .  
As envisioned at the Council of Agriculture , recreation agriculture in Taiwan will embrace farming , livestock , forestry and fishing in line with the special features of each area . Visitors will get to admire the countryside in its endless seasonal transformation , and have a go at growing rice , picking tea or catching fish . They can also experience local culture in progress , and see temple festivities , open-air performances and prayers for the harvest .  
In 1978 , the late President Chiang Ching-kuo , premier at the time , had local cultural development listed as one of the 12 major development projects . Cultural centers were built in towns with county or municipal government s across the province .  
The formation of culture is strongly influenced by geographical factors , " says Tsai Hsiang-hui , an associate professor of history at the Chinese Culture University who serves as a trustee to the cultural foundation in Peikang . " The significance of local cultural and educational foundations lies in bringing together people from the same area , sharing similar customs and backgrounds , to show their concern for local culture . If we are n't elementary school classmates , we may be distant cousins .  
Soldiers came from the local brigade to set up a sunscreen , and the electricity company contributed the use of a cherry-pick for pruning the upper branches . Others who lent a hand included farmers , horticulturalists , specialists from the Dept . of Agriculture &amp; Forestry and the National Taiwan University 's department of plant pathology . The offending concrete was removed and the soil changed , with the result that old roots have begun to bud anew , and there seems to be hope for the survival of the tree .  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed . So there are many areas where the military authorities and local government will have to work together in the future .  
D . in soil and agricultural sciences from the University of Hawaii , he returned to Taiwan four years ago . In Taiwan he specialized in recultivation of seeds from rare and precious local varieties of trees . Because he made a major breakthrough in asexual propagation , he had just begun to earn a reputation . Yet it was just at this point that he chose to pull up roots . "  
Three years ago , when first appointed principal of the island 's only junior high , Fuan Junior High School , Lin Yao-wen became deeply enamored of the local scenery , which has been especially favored by nature . The entire family of volcanoes ringing Taipei , including Mt . Tatun , Mt . Chihsing , Mt . Shamao and Mt . Kuanyin , are all visible from the school 's athletic grounds , and the magnificent Keelung River and Tamsui River slowly wind by .  
With a simple and honest look of a farmer , matched with authentic Taiwanese and heavily accented Mandarin , he was extremely effective at using local flavor to add to the persuasiveness of the commercial . "  
Hsiao Min , a Christian , says that every time the passage to a new year approaches , churches will print their own red envelopes , which congregants can use at no charge . Because propitious proverbs from the Bible have been imprinted on the set , they are very popular among the congregants , so that supply ca n't keep up with demand . Since they integrate traditional customs , they can also help the evangelical church spread and adapt to local conditions . "  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
The Chang 's , for instance , who were the first to become foster parents , have become an " instructional boot camp " - - and not just for new foster parents . Since they 're so outgoing and personable , rich in experience and adept at breaking through a child 's " psychological defenses , " Sung Li-hsun often sends children to the Chang 's first so they can see how fostering works and adapt to the local environment before being " parceled out . "  
The salary of a locally born maid is about NT $ 20,000 , while the average for a foreign national is only about NT $ 15,000 , " points out an executive-level professional woman employed in a foreign corporation , who has hired both local and foreign-born help , " and besides , these days only middle aged grannies are willing to work as domestics in Taiwan , and they are very selective themselves , and have a lot of demands like vacation or raises . "  
The " Mei Stream Arts Society , " organized by twelve local Puli painters including Liang Kun-ming and I-yong Hung , has continually held individual and group exhibitions since being established fifteen years ago , and has earned quite a fine reputation in the arts community .  
" Shuishalien : Originally the name of the local aboriginal tribes in the Puli - - sun Moon Lake area ; surrounded on four sides by mountains at an altitude of about 500 meters , it is the geographic center of Taiwan with many natural springs and a moderate climate ; the tea produced there has a unique flavor and its water is perfect for tea . "  
When the 27,000 residents of Shuili Rural Township heard that the Chichi line would be dismantled as soon as their fleet new highway was finished , they launched a mass petition drive and formed the Chichi Line Preservation Committee , pooling local tourist resources and holding special activities to attract outside visitors .  
An example is Peikang 's annual Matsu birthday , half of the costs of which are paid by the temple , and the other half by the local community and trade guilds . Everyone is encouraged to put forward performing columns for the procession , and Peikang 's special tradition of yi-ko flower chariots is being preserved .  
In the past two years , headlines such as these have been continuously appearing in local newspapers and magazines . Not only have the " weak and brittle " small and medium enterprises been moving in droves to mainland China and Southeast Asia , even the rock-solid transnational corporations are letting out the word that their capital will go elsewhere because of environmental disputes , or the rising costs of land and labor .  
Altogether , there are probably no more than ten similar local drama troupes . Participants mostly have a sense that cultural development between the cities and the rural areas is too imbalanced : In Taipei arts groups are concentrated together and there are abundant performing arts . But elsewhere , after the powerful assault of the mass media , now everyone is bolted in front of the TV watching the same old TV personalities and plots that have nothing to do with their daily lives . Where have those dramas that reflect local life gone to ? "  
Display local vitality , and the renewal of life : " Affairs are in the hands of men . " Ho Chien-wei learned from this set of performances that drama companies can compromise with and come together with local cultural centers : " The local administrative system is the greatest source of energy . If you just give them a chance , they can escape from the traditional recalcitrant attitude of ' having one more thing to do is not as good as having one less thing to do . ' '  
If the birds only have a place to go , and the environmental impact assessment for the industrial zone can be brought up to requirements and implemented , " no one would oppose the locality developing an industrial park , " says one official at the COA who hopes the local government can enter into reasonable , calm dialogue . Since those closest to the black-faced spoonbill are the local residents , to protect it first requires getting local support .  
The promotion and advertising of formula in less developed nations has created the mistaken belief that formula is superior to mother 's milk . Yet because of limited wealth , local women thin the formula out , so that children do not get enough nutrition . Also , there is no safe , clean water , and purification and disinfecting are inadequate , so the infant mortality rate is extremely high .  
Further , the voters should respect the fact that legislators are national level representatives , and must be responsible to the people of the whole nation , and not ask their legislators to waste their money and energy going to local social gatherings or attending weddings and funerals and the like [ as local officials routinely do ] , nor select legislators on the basis of localism or the narrow concerns of some special interest group . This is the only way to give legislators more room to attend to the policy process .  
Given that in some areas of Taiwan local residents have made a killing by developing the seafood industry by raising fish in nearby shallows , Lu Tao fishermen are even more unsettled because they are restricted from doing the same by the environmental protection regulations of the ECNSAA .  
As for outsider divers , Mr . Chen has " some thing I 'd like to say " : " They go down to the bottom wearing heavy gear , but do n't understand the nature of the water ; when they 're hit by a sudden current and ca n't get their footing , they end up carelessly grabbing and breaking off and stepping all over and destroying the coral . " But it 's the local fishermen who get stuck with the reputation for destroying the ecology .  
Of course , given the current technological level of domestic manufacturing , it is still difficult to undertake joint R &amp; D or sales exchanges with major American or European corporations . In order to transfer some of the more advanced technologies , it is necessary that they first be digested by ITRI before they can be given over to local operations .  
In 1988 , which was the second year after Vietnam began to permit foreign investment , Chang came by himself to Ho Chi Minh City . Upon inspecting local conditions , he discovered that the natural surroundings in southern Vietnam closely approximate those in the banana growing areas of central and southern Taiwan .  
Besides the consideration of low land costs , the concept of " bringing Taiwan 's experience in agriculture together with Vietnam 's natural resources " is just right for what the Vietnamese government - - stuck with backward local production methods and an urgent need to close the gap between city and country - - wants and needs . It has thus won their strong support .  
Different in thinking but not in status : Wildlife protection groups around the world today generally come in two kinds : One takes radical action to support the total prohibition of trade in endangered species ; the other believes that wildlife protection can not be accomplished in a single step and tries to study and gain an understanding of local conditions and works with local agencies or scholars in order to carry out long-term , systematic protection .  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
We do n't need to be overly concerned about this problem at present , " argues P . K . Chiang , political vice minister of Economic Affairs . Since the Six-Year Plan is public infrastructure , the primary consideration must be getting the job done right to benefit all the citizens . Other factors , like raising the level of economic and trade diplomacy , helping upgrade local firms , and so on are all subsidiary goals .  
The maintenance of the basic rural village structure , plus leisure time and extra cash that people are willing to spend on cultural activities , is just like Taiwan shortly after retrocession , before any electronic or television media had become widespread , when local opera was definitely in its prime .  
One candidate campaigning on an anti-Taiwanese independence ticket stirred up quite a bit of conflict when he went about the southern district of Taipei City " paying his respects " to his opponents . Even veteran ruling party whip Yao Eng-chi , nominated by the ruling party as candidate for Taitung County , did not exempt himself from the local customs and went to demonstrate at the Central Election Commission when his political views were misrepresented on the official election roster .  
They have thus been preserved down to today . When a large banyan tree was " unfortunately " growing where a highway was planned to be widened at Toucheng in Ilan , the housing department 's urban planning section demanded that the local authorities remove it . In the end , a nearby temple gave up its own land for the road to pass through and the tree was saved .  
She is well aware that as an emigrant returning to her native land to work , although she has various natural advantages such as knowing English , making friends easily , and being more easily forgiven if she speaks out of line , on the other hand she has to become accustomed to things which other people are already used to , learn the demands of the local market , and overcome the difficulties of communicating in a language which she only half understands .  
Various units including the Industrial Development Bureau ( IDB ) and the Construction and Planning Administration at the central level to the local city and county governments have mapped out seven industrial parks , three recreational parks , new cities and towns , garbage dumps , and other projects for the west coast tidal land . It is estimated that development will go forward in 13 places , adding more than 40,000 hectares of tidal land , which is equivalent to the area of three Taichung cities .  
Three years ago , when Mr . You invited me to act as convener of Ilan 's " Editorial Committee for Locally Oriented Language Teaching Materials , " I made my acceptance conditional on his placing local vernacular education work in the cultural and educational sphere , and resisting any attempt to put it on the political level where it could become a tool in the Democratic Progressive Party 's political battles with the Nationalist Party ( KMT ) .  
Many practical difficulties : If children are required to study additional subject matter which is not related to future examinations , then implementing local vernacular instruction in a situation where schoolchildren are already under heavy academic pressure is bound to provoke a reaction from many sides , including the children 's parents , the pupils themselves , the schools and certain sections of society .  
But our local languages , especially within the Chinese language group , use ideographic rather than phonetic writing , and there is a clear separation between colloquial pronunciations and bookish pronunciations ; also some words have no written form , and some pronunciations are far removed from the written form . All these problems go to show that if one wishes to study local vernaculars , one faces the problem of the lack of a standardized writing system and phonetic notation .  
Regarding governmental affairs , Premier lien has actively promoted setting out a legal structure for local autonomy . For foreign relations , he has worked toward opening up bilateral and multilateral relations . Besides taking an active part in regional organizations ( such as APEC ) and seeking entry to organizations that are functional in nature ( such as GATT ) , he has also established a small policy group for working out a strategy for getting the R . O . C . admitted to the United Nations .  
Come and meet the In-specting King ! " An evil visitor borne by the waves : Each year at the middle of the sixth lunar month Wen Wangyeh , the deity who resides in Yunglung Temple in Tainan , leads the local people out to receive the Inspecting King as this " high official " disembarks on his far-ranging round of inspection , followed by his retinue of abandoned souls .  
Because tribal drinking is a social activity , if a local leading figure can be enlisted to set a standard and make a start by reducing quantities to a suitable level , in a short period of time results should be evident .  
And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep . The Taiwanese connoisseur is quite sniffy about his cup of tea . As the growing use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides has caused the local stuff to fall from favor , Pu'er tea , by satisfying a yearning for the new , has suddenly become all the rage .  
The famous fishballs and " iron eggs " ( eggs boiled in diluted soy sauce until small and hard ) attracted many customers , and the exhibits , books , magazines and other records of Tanshui 's history opened a window on the town 's past . The You Theater put on local opera performances in the streets , and to watch figures being blown from hot malt sugar was mouth-watering fun for adults and children alike . . . .  
" No men , no money , no power . Even if there is just as much courage and character at the local level , and as much love for the land and people , everything just gets rubbed out , " says one individual who formerly served as a county executive . Today , comfortably ensconced in his central government official 's office , he describes his former days as " hectic from start to finish , yet I was often so frustrated or felt so powerless that I was unable to sleep at night . "  
They have been put off for more than 40 years . Though local self-government has been implemented on schedule , its only legal foundation has been the literally paperthin ( only one page long ) executive order " Main Points for Implementation of Local Self-Government by the Cities and Counties of Taiwan Province . " Even the most basic laws for provincial level government have been held up .  
Taking the Taiwan Provincial Government for example , in terms of the hiring and firing of personnel , currently the provincial governor is appointed by the central government , and changes in the directors of the departments in the provincial administration must be approved by the Executive Yuan . The " province " is actually just the agent for implementing central level policies everywhere but in the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung ( which are directly under the central government ) . Naturally , this more or less guts the powers reserved to local governments .  
For those cities and counties with less developed economies , or with severe population outflow , the redistribution of funds is of course the best possible plan . But the money is not there just for the asking . Often expenses that are considered vital at the local level are not seen as such by the center . Sometimes the funds are given with so many restrictions as to how they might be spent that it is hard for the local government to put them to use .  
He is worried that with the limited economic power of the Ami residents of the Shankuang Estate , as more and more high-rise blocks are built and large numbers of Han Chinese move in , the Ami will gradually lose the advantage they have enjoyed of forming the vast majority of the local population ; furthermore , each unit on the estate measures only around 65 square meters , so that as second generation residents marry , lack of space will force them to move off the estate , creating a threat to cultural maintenance .  
This was due to rifts within the community on the Shankuang Estate between people who had supported different candidates in the local elections , and to people from different Ami tribes insisting on their own customs . For example , in different tribes the age at which one is eligible to take part in the male initiation ceremony varies from 15 to 19 . The spread of ages included in each age grade varies from three to five years , and there are also differences in traditional dress , and so on .  
Wang Hsing-ching observes that most people are far less ready to accept an aboriginal at the head of an administration than as a councillor , provincial assembly member or other elected representative , " for such representatives only represent their minority community , but the local chief executive represents a whole county or city , including the Han Chinese as well as the ' native people . ' '  
The main ceremonies of the Ami people are the " Sea Festival " held each June and the " Harvest Festival " each July and August . Travelling to the east in January as we did for this article , we missed the opportunity to attend those . But , since a local election is fast approaching , we ran into plenty of county assembly and mayoral hopefuls out trying to build up their name recognition by holding dinners in tents by the side of the road .  
Generally speaking , the local buildings are in fresh , bright colors , and the walls and masonry , set against the natural background of green and blue , are quite eye-catching .  
A learning processNevertheless , despite the fact that doctors were indeed respected in the Japanese occupation era , and in the old society local gentry always had the obligation to play a role in determining public policy , under the Japanese local elites only had the opportunity to occupy low level administrative posts like neighborhood chief , assistant , or secretary , or else the nominal " assemblymen " at various levels who had no power to pass legislation or even resolutions .  
The fine arts world at that time uncovered two homegrown artists , Hung Tung and Ju Ming , and the painting world was swept by a nostalgic " native realism " emphasizing things and people from local Taiwanese culture and society , and especially from the countryside . Representative artists included Hsieh Ming-chang , Ong Ching-tu , Chen Tung-yuan , and others like Hsi Teh-chin and Hsu Kun-cheng who had awakened to this style even earlier than the others .  
Contributions of the unknown workerAn interlude which our last ambassador to Thailand , Ma Chi-chuang , takes great pleasure in relating , is one which shows how truly outstanding were the contributions made by our agricultural technological team , for they not only earned the respect and love of the local inhabitants of northern Thailand , they also exerted a direct and positive influence on relations between the Republic of China and Thailand .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
With its rich text and pictures , Sinorama touches on a wide range of topics . It not only reflects such major facets of modern Taiwanese society as its political debates , social development , economic construction , environmental protection and so on , but also fills in the fine detail of its life and geography , its local culture and traditional customs .  
He offers the analogy that inviting foreign investment is like " borrowing a hen to lay eggs . " The country is still responsible for providing the twigs and making the nest . Yet local private enterprises , which , like quails , are small in stature but large in number , have not been given the attention they deserve . They have even been viewed as opportunistic and money hungry .  
For 30 years , Sanyi sold its products for export , but later Taiwan 's withdrawal from the United Nations and the international energy crisis brought a decline . Over the last decade , with a booming stock market and economic development , there has been an excellent market within Taiwan , especially for carvings of religious figures such as Maitreya Buddha , which are seen as symbols of prosperity by local people .  
In the coastal regions of every Asian country along the western Pacific ocean live large numbers of marine turtles , but many of the islands where they are distributed lack reliable monitoring and protection . Sea turtles have even gotten innocently embroiled in local wars or been negatively affected by the capers of private individuals . For this reason international conservation groups intend to devote the year 1995 to the West Pacific Marine turtle , hoping to encourage research and protection of marine turtles in this region .  
Unwilling to be disturbed , Lin refused to be interviewed . Reporters then camped out around her home . Some unfurled banners in protest , others went in a group with their publisher to present a " gift " of a golden Boddhisattva , and others also sent lavish presents . And some " set a new record for the Chinese media in America " by renting a helicopter to watch the wedding ceremony from the air , attracting disapproving stares from the local citizens and greatly disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood .  
A dialogue between modernism and nativismLooking from the perspective of musical history , local Taiwanese music with its mass support and elitist experimental modern music must extend upwards or downwards respectively , into the third level of the musical pyramid , before they can intermingle to produce a " local music " which is capable of really expressing the feelings and aspirations of Taiwan 's people , but which can also be played on an international stage and be shared with other nations .  
Teach fishermen restraintAlthough Taiwan 's tiny community of marine scholars has already been worn thin studying ocean-dwelling mammals , NTOU , the only institution engaged in shark research , put forth a five-year plan for basic research in this area . Their goal is to understand the local shark catch situation and provide data for reference if controls are imposed in the future .  
Moreover , it was not just anybody who could take a Japanese name - - only civil servants , teachers , village mayors , or local notables were eligible even to apply , and the application had to be reviewed and approved - - so that , in a way , the Japanese turned the unpalatable change in surnames into a kind of honor comparable to the traditional imperial surname .  
Taiwan firms are now defined as " special domestic investors " by the PRC , and they enjoy somewhat greater privileges and incentives than foreign firms . However , as the mainland makes the transition to a less protected market , it may be hard for Taiwan firms to hold on to the advantages that come with being one of the " local boys . " In the future they will have to compete with non-Chinese companies from the same starting point .  
Of course , everyone has their own version of the story , and it is hard to say who is right or wrong . But Li , looking at things from the point of view of enterprise development , feels that democratization in Taiwan is divorced from the rule of law , that the media is biased , that local elected officials stir up the population to win favor , and that the government - - though willing to help - - is unable to do anything . All these keep investors from moving forward . "  
By the 1995 fiscal year , not only had the surplus been exhausted , the government debt had reached more than NT $ 1.2 trillion . If the debts of the provincial , municipal , and local governments are added in , the country is now running at over NT $ 2 trillion in the red . This means that , on average , each of Taiwan 's 21 million people is responsible for more than NT $ 100-000 of national debt !  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
Many elderly people who were unable to collect their subsidies ended up accusing the staff of being obstructionist . Moreover , beginning next year the central government will no longer compensate local governments for hiring social workers . It is likely that after many social workers leave their positions , the work of visiting and protecting the handicapped , women , children , and other disadvantaged groups will grind to an even slower pace .  
Mr . Luo of Hsinglung Beef Noodles says the choice of meat is very important : on no account should one use imported frozen beef , for imported beef does not usually arrive in Taiwan until one or two months after it has been slaughtered , so that it is not as fresh as fresh-slaughtered local beef . Furthermore , imported beef has to be thawed before use , making it soft so that it can not be boiled for long without breaking up .  
According to the original recipe , the beef is first sliced and placed on top of the cooked noodles , then a superior stock made from chicken bones , medicinal herbs , shrimp sauce , fish sauce and so on is poured in ; lastly various raw vegetables such as chiutsengta and purple perilla are added , along with local herbs and leaves .  
The government should long ago have lifted the ban on private groups producing their own textbooks in order to get rid of the bad reputation for brainwashing students , " says Chou Chuan , who fought to have the ban on competition with the unified textbook system lifted . Few countries in the world except communist or backward nations use unified textbooks adopted at the national level . Even Communist China currently uses a system in which the central and local governments produce different textbooks .  
In terms of treatment of acute disorders , on the one hand , it is necessary to lessen the disparity between urban and rural areas ; on the other , a hierarchical medical care system must be developed , including basic medical care that covers the greatest possible area , second-level local medical care , and top-level regional hospital-centers ( RHCs ) and subdivisional hospital-centers ( SHCs ) , where complicated technology is a staple . The goal is delegating small hospitals for small ailments and big hospitals for big ailments .  
For instance , some people like to take fish spears underwater to catch fish . This not only results in a reduction of that species , but also affects the local food chain , or it forces fish schools to swim farther out to sea . Try to avoid disturbing the ecology . Also , many divers trample on soft coral or move pieces of stony coral , so that the algae and other organisms living on them die .  
In fact , the real cause of power rationing and blackouts can be seen from even a superficial glance : Because of rapid economic growth with a corresponding increase in national wealth , commercial and industrial demand for electricity has risen while consumer electric products have become common . On top of these , Taipower has run into land-acquisition problems and local resistance for plants it planned to develop , so these plants have not been able to come on line in a timely manner .  
At the beginning of December 1992 , they organized the first public hearing over the Meinung reservoir . At the same time , in order to build consensus among local citizens , they took to driving a rickety old farm vehicle without a license plate , with signs on the front and rear painted by artist Tseng Wen-chung which said in large letters , " For farm use " and " Seventh Section Work Station . "  
The public hearing gained the attention and sup port of the township council , the mayor and the citizens of Meinung . So in 1993 the Love Meinung Alliance was set up . It incorporated local leaders such as the mayor , neighborhood chiefs , social organizations and people from cultural circles , holding seminars in every neighborhood . They distributed hand-outs , and they decided to go north to Taipei to demonstrate in front of the Legislative Yuan , requesting the reservoir 's budget be eliminated .  
Old local gazetteers report the existence of " black gulches " to both the west and east of Penghu . The former-nicknamed " the Larger Sea " - - separated Penghu from Fujian Province , while the latter ( " the Lesser Sea " ) marked the boundary between Penghu and Taiwan . It was vital for ships trying to cut across these " gulches " to catch a strong wind in the right direction , otherwise they would be carried away by the current and placed in severe danger if they should hit a typhoon .  
At this time , " the editorial read , " the highest military official for Hebei was absent . Civil and military officials at all levels had been ordered to just stay in their positions , so they were even more cautious and restrained than usual . It is inconceivable that the local Chinese forces would have dared to spark an incident during the night maneuvers by the Japanese forces .  
Ten years ago , a number of Southeast Asian women were brought to this traditional Hakka community to look for partners among the local widowers and single men , but less than ten of them married and settled in the area , and " foreign brides " remained a rarity . Later , the practice was stopped from catching on when the government began to restrict the entry of single women from Southeast Asia on tourist visas .  
But the fact that the Chungho cases were all concentrated in a specific area ( around the small mountain behind Le Tien Temple and a few areas of similar topography ) means that the vectors have set down very firm roots in this city in northern Taiwan , creating what is defined as a " local epidemic . "  
In response to the human culture and natural environment of the Lanyang Plain , Wang Chen-hua incorporated many features often seen in old Ilan houses into the Chung home , such as turtle-shell pattern windows , and openings in walls in the shape of peaches and pomegranates , which symbolize good fortune . To cope with the local climate of fierce sunshine and abundant rainfall , the roofs have very broad eaves . In the central courtyard one can watch the rain and listen to its melody .  
Briton Dennis Casey , managing director of drugstore chain Watson 's The Chemist Taiwan , and a long-time resident in the Asia-Pacific region , observes that a few years ago prices in Taiwan were almost as high as in Japan . But with the fast opening of Taiwan 's markets and free competition , " the most efficient and modern international retailers are all setting up in Taiwan , bringing with them their international experience and vision , and seeking out low - price , high-quality products from all over the world to supply to local consumers . "  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society . " These poetry societies were not established in the modern academic era , and so they are representative of local temple fair society , " Chien says .  
Animals are spread throughout the island , yet many county and city governments lack any formal wildlife preservation unit , with perhaps only one person responsible for all wildlife protection efforts . Or maybe this work is given to already existing units as a secondary responsibility - - and treated accordingly . Coordination between central and local authorities is weak , and so it was the Council of Agriculture , rather than local officials , that broke the recent Yunlin dolphin meat case .  
As for dialogue content , in addition to those traditional scripts that still sound fresh after a hundred listenings , some people have begun to offer up new creations in step with current times . And the language employed is no longer Beijing Mandarin with its heavily retroflexed consonants . In recent years , comic dialogues have imperceptibly gone through an unprecedented metamorphosis - - they are now often recited in local dialects .  
One reason was because the discovery found its way into newspapers all over the world , and many people knew that now Puli had more than picturesque natural beauty and such special local products as rice noodles and shaoxing wine . The citizens of Puli also possessed a glorious treasure - - cultural property left behind by people of an age long passed .  
Whenever there was a construction site , a few bizarre pieces of stone , some large , some small , would appear on the surface of the ground . Some of them were still recognizable in shape ; it was obvious that they were knives , axes , arrowheads or other crafted objects that people had used at one time . Huge stone slabs made local residents suspect that they were the lids of coffins for some people of long ago .  
For example , every time he heard tell of a construction project going on within the range of the ruins , Tacheng Middle School teacher Chien Shih-lang would grab a metal screen and head for the dirt pile to " search for treasure , " sifting out from the dirt pile shards of stone coffin and other objects stirred up by the backhoes and arranging them in separate bags . He saved them , both as a record of local history and also as classroom material of local interest .  
Even if most of the descendants of the Ketagalan have forgotten their own identity , according to an investigation by Lin En-shean , a professor at National Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Ethnology , in the wake of the recent increasing social emphasis on " native soil , " meaning a new esteem for local Taiwanese culture , the atmosphere in society toward minority ethnic groups has evolved from prejudice and taboo to respect .  
He faces a number of urgent problems . One is how to balance economic growth and environmental protection in a Taiwan that is densely crowded and has already suffered serious ecological damage and pollution . Another is how to create a sound investment environment that will keep local capital at home and attract foreign investment .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Later , so the story goes , when the Song dynasty gourmet and literary giant Su Dongpo was demoted and sent to serve as an official at Huanggang in Hubei Province , to satisfy his palate in that remote , impoverished place he used cheap local pork to make his own unique version of spice-stewed meat . His recipe was passed down and grew popular , and came to be known as Dongpo Meat ; it is considered one of his greatest " achievements in office . "  
Grabbing the bird , I discovered that the webbing of her foot had been pierced by a hook caught in a rope used by the local aquaculturists . The swan 's blood was turning the water around her red . I quickly tried to pull out the fish hook with my hands , but the hook was too deeply caught in the flesh , and I ended up cutting my own index finger instead . All the while , the injured bird was splashing and struggling to fly away , drenching us with lake water .  
But Legislative Yuan members , local politicians and landowners rushed en masse to intervene , and the plan to " resurrect " Shihmen 's water sources was thrown out by the Ministry of the Interior . In August this year , after the disastrous typhoon , the residential , commercial and recreational zones around the Shihmen Reservoir were finally reduced in size .  
Sitting on the local as it shook and jiggled , I noticed that most of the other riders were elderly . Some of these grandfathers went so far as to stretch out on the seats for a nap . A grandmother had a shoulder pole with bamboo baskets full of vegetables that she was bringing to market . A few aboriginal women wearing broad-rimmed rain hats and carrying bamboo baskets got off in Tahsi on the way to odd jobs in nearby harbors .  
A little later , when the inspection was complete and everyone was getting ready to return to Taipei , just as the bus driver started the engine a local official responsible for ancient monuments rushed aboard the bus to express his views to the assembled committee members .  
But at a time when local cultural consciousness is flourishing , and with the associated preference for local plant and animal species , the sudden epidemic of disease among lowland pine trees has been greeted with no great concern by many in forestry and botanical circles . This is because the pine trees in Taiwan 's plains are all introduced species brought by immigrant settlers and colonists , who planted them out of nostalgia for their old homes .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Of ' Mui 's twin sons Huegu ( Chang Hui-kuo ) and ' Api , the one plays guitar to a professional standard , and the other has been described as an excellent singer ever since he was in elementary school . Once he was grown up , ' Api was hired by several tourist " culture villages " in Hualien County as a singing and dancing instructor . He has frequently gone overseas to represent his local area in international aboriginal singing and dancing performances .  
Originally the Defense Ministry planned to use the land for residential housing . But the local governments , elected officials at all levels , and scholars and experts , all lobbied for different proposals . There were people calling for the land to be used for commercial real estate , for a trade center , for a new city government office complex , for a university . . . . The argument raged for years .  
To fulfill an election promise to eliminate garbage from Taoyuan 's cities , County Executive Annette Lu has , first of all , applied to the EPA to build two inter-area incinerators which would be operational in four years . Secondly , she has asked 13 cities , townships and rural townships to build small-scale sanitary landfills , and permitted and aided towns in establishing small-scale incinerators and local dumps , which can serve as stop-gap measures before the main incinerators are built .  
Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines . Upon entering the country , every leader , conforming to local custom , changed into a Filipino shirt , marked by dazzling patterns and bright , fresh colors . The collective photo which all the leaders lined up for is permeated by the style and passion of Southeast Asia . It makes a strong impression on anyone who sees it , wherever they may be from .  
In the future , with commercial considerations at the fore , public phones in Taipei will be like those abroad . It 's possible that it will cost NT $ 5 for a local call , with additional charges for remote areas .  
Amid the growing voices of opposition widespread attacks on the government 's monopoly of radio broadcasting were heard . After much discussioon about broadcast policies , the government began in 1993 to turn over radio bands that were originally reserved for military use , and nearly 120 new mid - and low-range local stations were granted licenses .  
They quickly discovered that while she looked elegant and refined , she was broad-minded , direct and easy to get along with . Though she could n't speak Hakka , she could chat away half the day with them using signs and gestures . Though an artist , she spent her days working in the fields . Running up and down the mountain , she was soon as tan and as strong as the local farming wives .  
The Securities and Futures Commission is planning to vastly increase the depth and breadth of the Taipei stock exchange . In the future , any approved foreign company will be able to issue Taiwan depository receipts ( TDRs ) , and its shares will even be able to be listed on the Taiwan market , so giving local investors a greater diversity of choice . Keep a cool head  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Following local opposition to the fourth nuclear power station , the sixth naphtha cracker and other major projects , Bayer of Germany has , almost on the eve of the start of construction work , called a halt to its plan to build a chemical plant in the Taichung Harbor zone . This followed the newly elected county magistrate 's insistence that a referendum would be called to decide whether the plan should be allowed to go ahead . Although the central government is attempting to mediate , the future of the Bayer plan is now uncertain .  
In the light of the problems that the case has caused for Bayer , for the DPP and for central and local governments , Taiwan 's political parties have a responsibility to face up to the problems of overcoming political disagreements and formulating a set of realistic and complete methods , which have the confidence of the public , for policymaking , investment approval and environmental impact assessment in respect of major industrial projects . Otherwise , the future may bring more debacles like the Bayer case .  
Among the heavy responsibilities weighing on the superintendent 's shoulders , besides having to find financial donations , is that of finding people . Recruiting local doctors has proved difficult-several times when the hospital advertised for staff there were very few applicants , and some doctors who did agree to come and work subsequently changed their minds when another opportunity came up . The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .  
Cleveland was originally a center of machinery and steel . When the city fell on hard times , 30 local entrepreneurs formed a " roundtable " to find a way out of the mess . After four years of extensive discussions , they designed a strategic plan for the direction of future city development .  
However , it was often impossible for more distant locales , like Fujian and Guangdong , to receive the official almanac in a timely fashion . Attracted by economic incentives , local practitioners of the occult began privately publishing their own books ; these included much additional material on the rules for occult calculations .  
Taiwan , however , has an integrated economic system . Its developmental and economic policies have always been set by the central government . Such centralized policy making has wiped out traditional local industries . Even the island 's leisure and entertainment pursuits are Western transplants seen nationwide .  
From the memories of old family members and from old photographs , one can reconstruct the exquisite scene of former times : at dawn the dense mist hanging over the seven pools enshrouds the surrounding paddy fields , but as the first rays of sunshine strike through , one sees the Li Family Compound , built of bricks and stone , standing sturdy among the expanse of green . This is why the local nickname for this great house was " Beauty in the Fields . "  
The economic basis of the Li clan 's livelihood had been laid down by Li Qingshui 's gradually buying up a huge area of farmland , but because the family suffered harassment from local tyrants , the seven brothers of the third generation decided to support the naturally gifted Li Shuhua , to allow him to devote himself completely to study . Shuhua really did pass the imperial examinations , and later became chief examining officer for the initial xiucai grade civil service exams for the whole of Taiwan .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
When a temple dedicated to the Earth God was moved from its original spot near a ring road , Lin asked local elders how they planned to celebrate the completion of the move . Some said that when they were small and the temple was first built , a drama troupe was invited to perform the dance of Zhong Kui ( a benevolent deity who protects people from evil ) , and that they would like to see that again .  
The Japanese were the first to lay roads into the region in order to crush anti-Japanese resistance on Mt . Tsao . Stumbling upon the volcanic topography , they built the hot spring baths for which the whole area from Mt . Tsao to Peitou would become famous . From 1924 , the Japanese began an effort to " create a forest on Mt . Tatun . " They also encouraged local farmers to set up nurseries , which are the forerunners of the flower farms visited by tourists today .  
Taiwan and Silicon Valley are currently mutually dependent . But Silicon Valley , possessing such a broad , deep and up-to-date technological foundation , is the world 's technology capital . Over the last two spring vacations , Wu Se-hwa , director of Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management , has taken graduate students to see Silicon Valley first hand . He reminds the local industry : " If Taiwan hopes to continue to advance , it must continue to import people and experience from Silicon Valley . "  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
Damiana is far from being an impressive plant . In the arid areas of the peninsula , which are dominated by huge columnar cacti and wide-canopied mesquite trees , its humble appearance may belie its importance for the local inhabitants . It is a small shrubby plant that grows in the dry soils of northern Mexico , Baja California and southern Texas .  
When one mentions the standard of English among schoolchildren and students in Hong Kong , professors at leading local academic institutions such as the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology ( HKUST ) generally express the view that it often leaves much to be desired . " More class time is spent explaining English than teaching subject matter , " says Professor Chi Hsi-sheng of HKUST 's Division of Social Science .  
The former is a passive network . It is activated when a doctor anywhere in Taiwan comes across any disease which , according to law , must be reported ; the doctor then files a report with the local bureau of public health . The latter network involves cooperation among public health agencies and about 800 doctors nationwide . Each week a telephone survey is done of the situation in various areas , so that there is constant active monitoring of overall public health conditions .  
When she came to Taipei three years ago , she did not choose a foreign firm , in which internal communication is normally done in English . Rather , she entered a local urban planning firm , in which only Chinese was spoken , and learned her Chinese the hard way .  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
In local folk-worship traditions in Taiwan , there are so-called " unmarried miss temples , " dedicated to women who died unwed . Deceased unmarried women are considered to be among the " lonely souls without homes " to whom offerings are made on the 15th day of the seventh lunar month each year . This is because memorial tablets for unmarried women can not be placed in the family home after their deaths , so there is no one to make offerings to them in the afterlife .  
Taiwanese has survived only because people of Fujianese ancestry are the majority in Taiwan . However , though policies designed to suppress the use of all dialects ( such as fining or hanging humiliating placards on students who spoke dialect in school , or restricting time dedicated to programming in local dialects as did the broadcasting law promulgated in 1976 ) the impression was deepened that Taiwanese was relatively crude-a " low class " language that , though perhaps more intimate , was not suitable for elegant situations .  
During a visit by Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan , the local people , exasperated by the effects of two calamities in quick succession , aimed a torrent of invective against the government 's inappropriate planning and poor preventative measures . Some people blamed the flooding on inadequacies in straightening work carried out on downstream sections of the Keelung River , causing flooding further upstream .  
In the case of another elder generation artist , when the owners of the Hsinsheng South Road studio in which Lee Shih-chiao spent nearly 40 years reclaimed the premises , a space in the Apollo Building in east Taipei had to be purchased instead . Although a museum was established , as a consequence it lost its potential local commemorative significance .  
Why could n't a gas station be set up on the island ? The provincial government discovered that the sticking point was obtaining the land . If suitable sites were n't on national government land , then they were owned by temples . But after the provincial government negotiated with the National Property Bureau and discussed the matter with local residents , the island was finally able to get its gas station .  
" The tendency in the past was to stress the power of the central government . This limited the power and capabilities of local government , " says Woody Cheng , chief of the history teaching section at Feng Chia University . In Cheng 's opinion , the " patriarchal " political structure had the effect of turning government bodies below the provincial-government level into powerless " daughters-in-law ; " dependent upon the " patriarch 's " mood for their own allocations of money and power .  
Whether lower-level measures related to localization of government can be implemented smoothly remains to be seen . These lower-level measures include the consensus reached by the National Development Conference on downsizing the TPG , making the jobs of village chief and township chief into positions appointed by the central government rather than elected by the public , and ending elections for village and township councils . Many are worried that parochialism may become more apparent when tasks that were originally handled by the TPG are handed over to local governments .  
The next six provincial governors were all Taiwanese . During their terms in office , they put top priority on : developing local infrastructure ; providing better social services for workers engaged in agriculture , industry , and fisheries ; expanding the social safety net ; cleaning up local environments ; building planned communities ; accelerating rural development ; implementing the second phase of rural land reform ; providing full health insurance benefits for farmers ; reorganizing agricultural production ; and encouraging the use of more sophisticated agricultural technology .  
Thus evolved seafood dining in Taiwan , from simple roadside stands by the harbors to specialty shops to the " Warring States Period " pitting high-class restaurants against cheap chain shops against fresh fish street vendors . Meanwhile , because seafood raised in aquaculture ponds or imported from abroad has steadily replaced local seafood caught near the shores of Taiwan , the " most-favored fish " lists-especially for wedding banquet dishes-have seen some radical changes of fortune .  
Mrs . Hung , who grew up in Tanshui and runs a seafood restaurant , nostalgically recalls eating chouduyu ( a siganid ) caught at the mouth of the Tanshui River . She says : " Natural chouduyu did n't even need salt , it tasted fragrant and sweet just fried up straight . If you buy chouduyu that was raised in an aquaculture pond , you have to add soy sauce just to cover the smell of the earth . " But local fish caught in the open ocean like the chouduyu are growing scarce .  
On the subject of differentiation of content , Wang Zhidong says that wherever a website is based , its content has to be decided by local users . For instance , in Taiwan and Hong Kong people are mainly interested in entertainment and leisure , spicy show business news and the stock market ; but in mainland China the most popular subject is sport , especially football . People from Beijing or Shanghai often fall out online over the teams they support .  
In addition , the domestic cable television market has increased its openness to foreign investment , and foreigners can directly or indirectly own up to 50% of the stock . The central government has also authorized local governments to manage local cable television operations , stipulating that operators grade their programs and sign formal contracts with subscribers to ensure the rights of consumers .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
Mr . Tseng , who makes his living from manufacturing metal parts for pet products , lives with his wife in Hsinchu , where they are both deeply involved in local charity work . They founded the Tong Hsin Volunteer Service Association , whose efforts are focused on services for the elderly and on recycling . They are also both counselors in the Hsinchu Family Education Service Center . Their colleagues consider them a perfect couple .  
In 1930 , aborigines in the area of Wushe stormed a sports day at the local school , killing over 100 Japanese , including policemen and teachers . The motivation for the attack was anger at Japan 's repressive policies for " governing the barbarians , " by which the authorities endeavored to requisition territory and exploit the forestry resources of Taiwan 's central highlands . Under these policies , the culture and traditional ways of life of aboriginal tribes were effectively outlawed , and those that resisted were massacred .  
For an answer it is perhaps worth considering the larger context-the state of the industry around the world today : in short , the unchallenged dominance of Hollywood on the global market . This has squeezed out local productions and decimated film industries in many countries , as well as reducing cinema from an art-form to a spectacle , from which viewers expect simply visual and auditory entertainment .  
Some of these dishes are seasonal , while others are staple foods , and quite a few are similar to local Taiwanese snacks . " Back then both Taiwanese and mainlanders were poor , so everyone ate whatever was cheapest ! " says event organizer Tsao Sen . Over a dozen dishes were on display , but on closer inspection , he says , they were all based on just three main ingredients : wheat flour , rice and sweet potatoes .  
And in Meinung , a red banner draped in front of the Founding Uncle altar at the East Gate , presented by a local believer , reads : " Praying for sons , for wealth and for honors ; for academic success and for peaceful well-being . " Chang An-sheng , a local senior who sweeps the altar at 4 a.m . every morning , remarks : " Old Uncle here grants whatever you request . He 's especially effective with requests for examination success ! "  
Once a week we worked on a specific topic assigned by Marian . We did role playing ( bought and sold stocks , for example ) , prepared a newspaper column , visited a local junior college , and picked wild strawberries . We even carried out a mock American-style election by printing out election ballots . Marian brought her shower curtain from home to set up a voting booth in the classroom .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
Filling the open spaces around the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung , and crowded onto nearby rooftops , some 20,000 spectators , including over 200 local and international journalists , were waiting for the action-an enormous number given the usual low attendance at art events .  
The scrap contained large amounts of insulation material made of plastics containing chlorine , so burning it produced highly toxic dioxin . The stench from the fires forced pupils at the nearby Nanning Junior High School to wear cotton face masks to school , and there were high rates of respiratory tract diseases among local residents .  
" The basic idea of welfare measures is to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to encourage social stability and integration . But with everyone fighting over the money , it has divided the central government against local governments , rich counties against poor counties , and various disadvantaged groups against one another , " says Wang .  
Ever since 1991 when the ROC amended its constitution , it has defined cross-strait relations as state-to-state relations or at least a special state-to-state relationship , rather than an internal relationship between a legitimate government and a renegade group , or between a central government and a local government .  
Lin Chih-cheng , an architect and a keen student of colonial-period urban planning , points out that " the colonial period has left Hsinchu with a rich architectural legacy . Many buildings in the city retain their original appearance from that era , including the offices of the city government ( Hsinchu Prefectural Hall under the Japanese ) , the local law courts , the train station , Hsinchu Middle School Kendo Hall , the Kuomin Theater and the houses of Air Force Village No . 11 .  
She explains : " Kaohsiung 's industrial structure has long stagnated around the petrochemical and steel industries . Not only is output value low , the environmental costs are very high , and it is almost impossible to raise the quality of life for local citizens . " Upgrading the local industrial structure , she believes , requires devoting more attention to technology . Therefore she hired experts in electronic commerce from Taiwan and from abroad and founded her own company , through which she hopes to improve the e-commerce capabilities of Kaohsiung companies .  
In 1991 , the older generation of KMT politicians that filled the seats of the legislative branch of the central government-who had been in place since 1947-were forced to retire . Finally , the people of Taiwan , who in the past could only vote for local officials and a very small number of so-called " supplementary seats " to the national parliament , could elect their own legislators .  
" Formerly , Taiwan under its authoritarian political system never cultivated mechanisms to encourage autonomy . It lacked a civil society given to self-reflection . It was n't in the habit of discussing , deliberating and making judgments , and it lacked a concern for local affairs . " Ping Lu 's soft , moderate tone reveals an undercurrent of hurt .  
While a 5,000-year-old cultural legacy was being smashed to smithereens on the mainland , the ROC 's commitment to " revive classical Chinese culture and carry on traditional ways " represented a difficult burden for the small island of Taiwan to bear by itself . President Chiang Kai-shek would serve as head of the " Council for Chinese Cultural Renaissance . " Peking opera and classical Chinese painting were deliberately promoted and local Taiwanese culture suppressed .  
The Lin family 's " New Tile House " was built almost two centuries ago , and is the oldest family compound in the Liuchia high-speed rail development area . The high-speed rail plan originally called for the ancestral shrine and some of the defensive walls to be preserved as a park , but local residents and the Lin family are not satisfied with this solution and have been protesting to the agency in charge of the high-speed rail in the hope of persuading it to preserve the entire compound .  
According to museum employee Lu Yu-hua , many people express surprise that there should be an entire museum devoted solely to paper , but when you really think about it , there 's really nothing strange about it . When paper was first invented , the raw materials from which it was made differed from one region to the next . A single sheet of paper spoke volumes about local climates and vegetation ; its very existence enabled the spread of knowledge , and could record the history of an individual or an entire nation !  
Wang Tsu-hua 's wife is from Puli , which is why he moved there in 1985 and opened a restaurant . Because he had a great liking for the place 's artistic and cultural style and for its people , and also makes ceramic art , he later got actively involved in the local artistic and cultural scene . He even helped set up a " New Puli Development Committee " to promote entrepreneurial culture there .  
Many suggest that the causes underlying these problems date from the downsizing of the provincial government . Power over local resources has become more centralized , leading to a consequent decline in local self-rule . Compounding these problems , many of the county and city governments in areas seriously affected by the earthquake are controlled by the DPP or are not under the control of any one party , whilst many of the grass-roots level administration is in the hands of the KMT . This creates an unwieldy political environment and generates envy between central and local administrations .  
The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials . They also developed a system under which a population-based quota of talented individuals from each county and prefecture could be selected for a state education , which gave officials at the local level a fair shot at promotion .  
A county magistrate with an excellent record could be made prefect , just one step from becoming a minister at court , and the majority of prime ministers during the Han dynasty came up through the ranks in this way , having started out as junior officials at the county or prefectural level . For this reason , the Han dynasty stands out in history for the quality of its local political administration .  
In Anhui Province there was Ouyang Xiu 's self-effacingly named Pavilion of the Drunk Old Gentleman , where the mind of the aforementioned gentleman was preoccupied with scenic wonders rather than the next drink . The settings of these retreats reflected the aesthetic ideals of the literati and their detached approach to life , and it was these same people , the educated elite , who set the tone for national and local administration during the Song dynasty .  
Many scholar-officials also formed communities out of their own extended families by establishing clan congregations , updating genealogies , and setting up private schools to educate promising youngsters . These new forms of local organization helped society to remain orderly and civilized , and fostered an overall mood of culture and enlightenment . Rule by the learned  
The introduction of foreign labor has been a mixed blessing for Taiwanese society . While helping to provide temporary relief for the labor shortage , keeping the island 's products competitive and easing pressure for firms to move offshore , the policy has also had unwelcome side-effects . Foreign labor has been blamed for undermining the local job market , putting a brake on the pace of industrial upgrading and triggering social problems .  
In his Master 's thesis entitled War and the Taiwanese , Li Kuo-sheng states that the system first appeared after the January 28th Incident of 1932 , when the Japanese attempted unsuccessfully to invade the lower Yangtze valley from their concession in Shanghai . Okamura Yasuji , chief of staff of the Japanese Imperial Army , was anxious to bring an end to the endless patronizing of local prostitutes by Japanese soldiers . To this end he ordered the establishment of military " comfort stations " where the soldiers could take care of their sexual needs .  
In 1553 , during the Ming dynasty , after a Portuguese " tribute ship " was blown aground , the Portuguese captain asked to lease a nearby fishing village to dry out the goods . A local maritime official acceded to the request . In 1614 , after the Portuguese had assisted the Ming court in defeating pirates , Viceroy Zhang Ming-gang secured the emperor 's consent to allow Portuguese to settle permanently in Macau .  
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .  
The whole time they have been putting forth competing policy proposals , Soong and the KMT have been engaged in a furious behind-the-scenes struggle to win the allegiance of local politicos who wield great influence over voting at the grassroots level . The Chung Hsing Bills scandal has brought Soong nothing but bad news on this front . Heavyweight politicians who had been sitting the fence have now returned to the KMT fold , including Hakka leader Wu Poh-hsiung and Yunlin 's county chief Chang Jung-wei .  
If elected , I will change the obsolete bureaucratism in the central government , and undertake complete reinvention of the government . I will create a clean , honest , and capable government , one that adheres to the concept of " government by partnership , " so that whatever the local governments can do , the central government should not get involved in ; and whatever the private sector can do , the central government should also not get involved .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
When TCAC puts on an activity , for example , if someone notices that an event organizer is getting thirsty they will immediately bring him a bottle of mineral water . When a musical performance is scheduled , someone will always take it upon themselves to set out seats for the audience . " If the local residents agree with what you 're doing , they 're sure to pitch in and help , " says Shu , who considers this spirit of volunteerism much more valuable than monetary donations .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
Beginning in the late 6th century traders from the West began setting up glass workshops in the Chinese imperial capital , and local artisans now learned the technique of glassblowing . With Buddhism in its heyday in China , glass vessels were frequently used for presenting devotional offerings of clean water , flowers and fruit , or as pure receptacles for the ashes of senior clergymen .  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
Attempts were made to eradicate the influence of organized crime in politics during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , but the party also needed votes and had to nurture local factions . As Wang points out : " Several ministers of finance were forced out of office for raising taxes . No wonder the public tends to regard the KMT as ' rich but uncouth , ' and as having allowed ' black and gold to rule in tandem . ' "  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
In the 1980s , a number of young directors joined Taiwan 's film community . They made a bold break with tradition and gave rise to a new wave in local film . After a harsh winnowing , only Hou Hsiao-hsien and Edward Yang remained , the former noted for his excellent grasp of Taiwanese imagery and the latter for his clinical depiction of the urban middle class .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
Li Hsi-chi got his initial inspiration from the inscribed wooden plaques that grace the door lintels of clan temples in Kinmen . He executed an entire series of paintings based on them before moving on to throw occasional poetry events modeled after the elegant parties indulged in by the upper classes in centuries past . Li also called on artists and writers from both Taiwan and the mainland to tour Kinmen and understand the beauty of the local culture . These activities spurred the local community to a heightened interest in cultural preservation .  
Dong enjoys enthusiastic support from the local community , which has provided him with generous financial assistance , manpower , filming locations , and more . The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
He illustrates his point by mentioning Straight Ahead with a Rifle , in which Dong continually returns to the image of a bombing range , communicating how it feels to live next to such a place . It is a factor always on the minds of local residents . This repeated use of a single image is a very unusual technique , but it does n't bore the viewer ; on the contrary , it leaves one feeling that he has gained new insight into the subject of the documentary .  
This film returns time and again to images of patriotic slogans on local walls , highlighting the helpless feeling of knowing that the island one calls home has been chosen to serve as a battlefield . Homesick 2000 Meters shows how near the cities of Kinmen and Xiamen are across the water , yet how far apart their residents live due to political reality . The empty scenes in this documentary highlight the longing for home of a people cut off from their roots .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .  
However , given the trend of globalization of firms , there are growing economic opportunities in ROC diplomatic partner states . New Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Hsin-yi , a successful entrepreneur himself , was a key member of the delegation that accompanied President Chen Shui-bian abroad in mid-August . He devoted particular attention to the local investment climate in each country , and came up with a few suggestions of his own .  
" If you really want to help those cities and counties , then you 've got to implement ' local self-rule , ' so that the local governments ( which are now only tertiary government units ) really acquire sufficient power and money , " argues Hsia Chu-joe . Otherwise , if the " southern science park " that is now being built in Tainan County is successful , perhaps it , in combination with the " three direct links " and the high-speed railway will create new opportunity for central and southern Taiwan .  
This naturally makes local governments very reliant upon , and vulnerable to control by , the central government . Although the actual amount of the tax redistribution is limited , local governments have to shoulder most of the burden of maintaining infrastructure , social services , education , cultural activities , and more . Local finances are very strained as a result .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
In fact , I 'm furious with it , but what can I do ? " The leaders of 23 local governments signed a petition demanding that the central government allocate still more of the Tax Redistribution Fund to them . " The petition was immediately supported by everyone , regardless of party affiliation , and regardless of whether they were on Taiwan proper or its outlying islands . "  
Taichung City is worse off still , receiving only 0.64% ! Leaders from Taichung recently joined with colleagues from the other four county-level cities in demanding a larger share of funds from the central government . Their protest activities included a joint trip by local administrators to Taipei to press their case .  
The elected heads of Taipei County , Taichung City , Tainan City , Ilan County , and other local governments around Taiwan are in virtually unanimous agreement that " the central government should completely re-think its revenue sharing philosophy and formulate consistent criteria for determining a fair distribution . Such criteria might include population , land area , and degree of need . "  
It is necessary because within a single nation , different local governments take in different amounts of revenue due to their unique geographic , environmental , and economic conditions . The central government can not sit idly by while people in certain areas are unable to enjoy basic government services , so it uses various means to alleviate revenue shortfalls where they exist . The Tax Redistribution Fund is one such method .  
The 47% share previously allotted to Taipei and Kaohsiung was decided upon last year after the government canceled a plan to abolish all local sales taxes and replace them with a single national sales tax . Now that this share has been lowered to 43% , the other cities and counties have seen their combined share go up to 39% , with each local government 's individual share calculated on the basis of population , land area , and other factors .  
In Professor Tseng 's opinion , " It 's not easy to create a more transparent formula . Due to current political realities , the proportion of the Tax Redistribution Fund allocated to the wealthier local governments ca n't be cut too drastically . Disputes are inevitable , but if this constant arguing yields a better system , then it will have been worth the trouble . "  
Many of this year 's award winners , including Piyouma , Wantan , and Wukou , are aboriginal or Hakka websites . Such communities have the innate advantages of rich non-mainstream traditional cultures , and can feature novel or unusual local customs . Therefore , these communities have more raw material to work with in constructing a website .  
The Nankang Hills stretch across the Taipei Basin as a straight finger of low sandstone peaks 140-370 meters high . Their highly uneven topography , carved out by the abundant local rainfall , has meant that despite lying cheek by jowl with the city , they have been spared destructive overdevelopment and have been able to maintain a basic forest environment . The hills ' great diversity of microenvironments creates a paradise for ferns .  
There were more rock concerts played by more local bands and attended by more fans than ever before in Taiwan this summer , and record companies have now had to introduce new categories for their CD output , such as pop bands , underground bands and live concerts . The most popular band at the moment , Mayday , this year sold 200,000 copies of its second album Long Live Love , which is a remarkable amount given the otherwise sluggish market .  
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which once stretched the length of Taiwan had already been breached . Apart from some scattered local stands , the Taiwan red cypress forest of Mt . Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000-plus hectares of Taiwan yellow cypress at Mt . Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are the island 's only remaining forests of giant trees .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
Using advanced technology and capital , developed countries have opened up huge tracts of tropical rainforest in the Third World for grazing land , and have tapped local species for genetic information to the benefit of the pharmaceutical and other industries . As a result of this theft of bio-resources , the poor get poorer , and environmental protection conflicts proliferate .  
For true flower lovers , the shy orchids of the wild are just as precious as the oversized local or exotic orchids grown in private gardens .  
Kuanshan Township is located in Taitung County , in the flat bottom of the East Longitudinal Valley . The Hsinwulu River runs through the township , and there are high mountains to either side . The majority of the residents are involved in farming , in particular growing Kuanshan rice , which is especially tasty because of the pristine local water . Such industrial activity as there is is of a low-polluting kind , allowing Kuanshan to retain its good natural environment .  
Grow Lin of YCF BonEagle notes that every level of government in the PRC , from central to local , and the various high-tech parks , are all very sensitive to what businesses want , and the incentives they offer to attract firms change correspondingly fast . Anything that does n't fit demand , or industries for which the market is already saturated , are likely to be left with nothing but the bones to chew on .  
Pingtung County Councilor Lin Yu-hung has raised the issue before the county council , stating : " Taiwan 's pending entry into the World Trade Organization will have a tremendous impact on traditional industries . The Pingtung County Government must promote the use of more advanced farming techniques and consider how to make local farmers more competitive . "  
The rapid expansion of China 's economy over the last few years has been a powerful lure to Taiwanese industry , and local businesses have flocked to China . This situation is widely held to be responsible for the problems of capital flight , sluggish domestic investment , the hollowing out of Taiwan 's manufacturing base and rising unemployment .  
So runs a local rhyme passed down by the residents of southern Taiwan 's Tungkang Township . Tungkang is a fishing village famed not only for its " three treasures " - bluefin tuna , oilfish and banded coral shrimp-but also for its Tapeng Bay National Scenic Area . Here in Tungkang , tourists and locals rub shoulders on streets scented with the damp smell of the sea , while out on the sea a few speckled boats pitch and roll as they sail slowly towards China .  
I found the most recent issue of Sinorama , with its reports on the special local character of places like Tungkang , Meinung , Chiaotou , and Linpien , very refreshing . The reports were very touching , and much more thoughtful than the usual tour book blurbs . This is the kind of reporting that is really lacking in our society today , and offers a sense of intimacy that Taiwanese readers abroad can really appreciate .  
Chen says with obvious gratitude that Puli Christian Hospital paid for the construction of the 170-square-meter premises , so the residents ' capital could all be used to fit out and stock the shop . The shop sells local Puli products such as passion fruit and honey , baked goods such as " Compassion " cakes and perilla cakes ( both similar to moon cakes ) and low-sugar , low-fat bread , along with all kinds of everyday supplies .  
Many family pedigrees in the local area also provide evidence of the fearsome loss of life that occurred . The deluge even came to the attention of the emperor himself , who ordered the imperial granary to ship emergency rice supplies . It was impossible to dig separate graves for each of the victims , so they ended up laid to rest in four large pits . Expressing deep sorrow over the disaster , the emperor declared that the " spirits of the victims would all end up in heaven just like the rest of us . "  
In the 1980s , she spent five years trekking around the coral rocks of Kenting , observing a local troupe of macaques . During that time their numbers gradually increased , but then suddenly almost the entire troupe was killed by hunters , and the population growth accumulated over many years was wiped out overnight . By the time Wu had finished writing up her thesis , the few survivors had disappeared among the windswept coral .  
A major reason is that unsophisticated Aboriginal people of that era were often cheated and oppressed by Han Chinese , so in comparison Maxwell 's apparently selfless efforts were very much appreciated , and word spread fast to all the local tribal communities .  
In addition , having seen the constant human resource conflicts that resulted from joint ventures between Taiwanese capital and Vietnamese private or public enterprises , the government now allows foreign ventures to wholly own their local affiliates .  
The resulting melange , sung in the local Minnan dialect , came to be known as gezai xi , or Taiwanese Opera , a very easy and enjoyable opera form that grew within 20 years into the most popular opera genre in Minnan-speaking areas . Troupes in Taiwan that had specialized in Beiguan , Gaojia , and Liyuan Opera switched over to Taiwanese Opera , and thanks to the close ties between Taiwan and Fujian , Taiwanese Opera took southern Fujian by storm in the 1920s and 30s .  
The pair get married , but the Snake King arrives disguised as a local village girl and steals the magic feather . In the end , Wan Shi turns into a huge boulder to pin down the Snake King , while the egret goddess gives up her magic feather to save the island , which has been laid to waste . Thanks to the sacrifices of Wan Shi and the egret goddess , the people are able to live in peace once again .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
" If you divide the financial sector up into state-run banks , private local banks , and foreign banks , the most at-risk group is that made up of the large state-run banks , which currently have the largest market share , " says Schive Chi , who knows what he 's talking about after years of experience in banking . The style of foreign banks is to make quick decisions based on comprehensive data , wielding a flexible array of products that keep up with the market .  
This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
This is a song of Kukeng Rural Township , written by a local resident . It accompanies newlyweds and couples from the rural township celebrating their golden and diamond anniversaries as they walk through a tunnel of densely packed foliage , symbolizing the continual revitalization of romance .  
Looking out from Tachien Peak ( the " great peak " mentioned in the rural township song ) , you discover your field of vision dominated by a sheet of green formed by natural vegetation as well as cultivated betelnut , and tea trees . In addition , after the 921 earthquake , layer upon layer of fossilized marine life , dating back 150 million years , has resurfaced . When you add to this the local sedimentary rock , it is clear that the Huashan area is rich in interesting topography .  
It may be that cultural activities encourage local productive economic activities to set deeper roots , and have a larger impact on the public . Or it may be a bottom-to-top effect , in which ordinary people raise their cultural refinement , and invest products with a richer image of local culture . Either way , Kukeng Rural Township in Yunlin County is devising a construction strategy that promises a win-win-win outcome for business , culture , and the environment .  
In the domestic market , most goods can already be imported freely , although the automotive sector is still protected by regional import quotas and will be affected by the opening of Taiwan 's market to vehicles from the US , Japan and Korea . Other local industries that will need to improve their competitiveness in response to WTO entry are electrical appliances , heavy electrical engineering , papermaking and foodstuffs .  
Little League baseball remains an inte-gral link in the memories all Taiwanese have of growing up . Professional baseball was also immensely popular for a time . However , in recent years , following regrettable incidents involving gambling and manipulation of players by local organized crime syndicates , baseball withered in the public 's fancy .  
Ten years ago , Japanese rice and dairy farmers strapped on headbands and took to the streets , like Taiwanese farmers on May 20th 1989 , but imported rice and pork could not compete with the high quality and safety guarantees of organically produced agricultural products , no matter how cheap they were . Japanese consumers remained very loyal to local rice . Two years ago , Japan abandoned its hard won caps on rice imports , because they no longer feared competition .  
WTO membership will be a blow to many agricultural counties , but in recent years tourist farms have sprouted up . These new operations offer rural residents a new way to make a living by offering visitors a taste of specialty products and unique local cultural attractions . Many novel ideas , like liquor-producing towns , and farming villages specializing in vanilla and other local crops , have appeared .  
However , it can not be denied that virtually all advanced capitalist countries operate national or local lotteries . Moreover , before Taiwan began public lotteries , illegal lotteries were already widespread ( and still exist ) , and even the stockmarket-itself a casino given the prevalence of " hot buys " and " insider information " - attracted huge number of " players . "  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
A study of weather data from the last 100 years that the National Science Council commissioned from a number of local universities revealed that Taiwan 's average temperature has increased by 1-1.4 �X C over the last century . While this increase was greater than the 0.6 �X C increase in average global temperature , it was in line with the increase in the average surface temperature on land . However , Taiwan 's summer temperatures have risen more than its winter temperatures , indicating a trend towards the hot getting hotter .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
The Chen clan of Hsiyu traces its local roots to a pair of brothers who came here from Kinmen during the Qing dynasty and set up a trade in Chinese herbal medicines . This old home is still in excellent condition . Thanks to its distinctive atmosphere , all of Erhkan Village has been designated a historic preservation district , the first time ever that an entire village has received this designation anywhere in the ROC .  
In contrast to its fellow " Little Dragons , " Taiwan 's economic policy has been waffling since 1997 . With so much still up in the air , foreign investors have been unwilling to put their money into Taiwan and local businesspeople have begun losing patience with the government 's dithering . Perhaps the most worrisome aspect of Taiwan 's economic outlook is that government and industry are headed in opposite directions and the distance between them is growing .  
This July , planning will be completed for the first free port in Taiwan , which should increase the efficiency of the movement of goods significantly . This will be helpful to Taiwan 's becoming a regional operations center for both local businesses and multinational companies .  
For example , for the Alishan Mountain Railway , considered one of the three most important mountain railways in the world , it is not enough to explain the chronological and technical processes of its construction . You must also explain its relationship to the entire history of lumbering and its effect on the forest , and conduct surveys of all the stations along the line . And your report has to exhaustively discuss the development of settlements along the way , the current operational status , problems and shortcomings , and the views of local residents .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
On the day of the French defeat , local residents subsequently ordained a ritual so as to pay homage to the ghosts of those who died so far from home . Regardless of whether the battle victims were from the mainland province of Hunan or from far-off France , all were buried within close proximity of one another , and received the same burial rites-an ending that is at once ironic and tragic .  
The Chinkuashih area has a unique , long , and complex history of geological activity . Tahan College associate professor Yu Ping-sheng , who has extensively studied the local geology , tells us that the sedimentary rock which forms the area accumulated on the ocean floor 25 million years ago .  
Li Tung-liang , a director of the Chaoyang Lukang Association , points out that in the early years of the Guangxu reign period ( 1871-1908 ) of the Qing dynasty , the Quanzhou woodcarving master Li Ko-chiu moved to Lukang , where he gathered together all the local wood sculptors and organized a guild . Today , a century later , its namesake organization selects an annual chief organizer by casting for divination sticks ; this individual is then responsible for arranging the ceremony honoring Lu Ban .  
But those workers who have lost their jobs are quite a different group from the workers in such urgent demand in industry . Michael Hsiao pointed out that those who are out of work have lost their jobs because changes in Taiwan 's industrial structure have made their skills obsolete . Continuing the restructuring of local industry is not going to create jobs for this group . Hsiao argued that the government should instead address the unemployment problem through social assistance measures , and the shortage of workers in key industries through economic policy .  
A plethora of media reports about medical malpractice disputes seem to announce a crisis of confidence between doctors and patients . When patients are dissatisfied with or doubtful about the treatment they receive at hospitals and clinics , the majority choose to remain silent and put their experience down to bad luck , while some voice their concerns directly to the doctor , hospital or local health bureau . But others seek out their elected representatives , complain to the media , throw eggs , carry coffins through the streets in protest , or institute legal proceedings .  
The late Lin Heng-tao , an expert on local history and customs , wrote that during the Japanese occupation the Octagon Market was Taiwan 's most fashionable shopping area . Popular merchandise included milk candy , red bean sweet bread , Tong Luo barbeque , sushi , and other Japanese foods . There were also handguns , telescopes , Japanese Warrior brand art supplies , toys , sake , beer , and soft drinks .  
He enlarged the puppets , put more modern faces on them and dressed them in brighter costumes . He used dry ice and flash powder to create a variety of stage effects . He also made changes to the music , importing a sound system and making bold use of local pop stars and Western music to accompany his plays . His golden-light theater came to dominate puppetry and he himself rose to the top of his generation of puppeteers .  
Academia Sinica professor Chen Kuo-tung , who served as chief editor of Leaves in the Wind , is quick to concede that the historical materials in the book have to be taken with a grain of salt , but argues that it makes a valuable contribution by bringing together scattered impressions of Taiwan that Westerners have had over a span of more than three centuries , thus giving local readers a chance to understand what their homeland has looked like to foreigners .  
This month 's cover story , " The New Star of the Post-Information Age-Digital Content , " analyzes the digital content industry , which is expected to be one of the next wave of key industries in Taiwan . It is an industry which requires unlimited creativity and rich content to come out on top . We also look at what steps the government is taking to utilize local cultural assets to create business opportunities , to make a knowledge-based contribution to the digital-era Chinese language market .  
We 're not afraid of competition . The more people in Taiwan get into this industry the better , for strength comes from solidarity . " Eric Lee , president of Softstar Entertainment , a major local computer games company , says that companies such as Softstar , Wang Film and CGCG have already formed a strategic alliance . They have also set up an " academy of the new arts , " in which experienced industry workers teach courses in order to pass on their knowledge and skills as quickly as possible .  
In an effort to reduce the gap between rural and urban areas , and to respond concretely to cultural demand in counties and small cities , the Government Information Office ( GIO ) broke with a 26-year tradition and this year moved the Golden Tripod Awards ceremony out of Taipei City for the first time . It was held in Ilan County , where it was able to tap into local cultural characteristics and displayed a definite Lanyang Plain flavor .  
Although these two parties , the only legal minority parties at the time , played only a marginal role as " tokens " of democracy under Kuomintang authoritarianism , nonetheless thanks to the idealism of key members like Chiang Yun-tien and Kao Yu-shu , and to popular disaffection with the KMT , the CDSP remained active in local elections and constituted a force outside the KMT .  
To provide guidance for future legislation , I have begun collating a compendium of local and foreign academic writings , legislation and court rulings relevant to transgender rights . With regard to the protection of homosexuals ' rights , I recently published a monograph entitled On Equal Protection for Lesbians and Gay Men , which I hope interested readers will read for themselves .  
If the rising popularity of alternative medicine in the US is a reaction against the rapid development of Western scientific culture , in Taiwan it is more a case of people taking a fresh look at some " old stuff " that is deeply rooted in local traditional culture .  
Chang Chuan-fen , a veteran activist in the gay and women 's rights movements , wrote a couple of lesbian novels packed with local color-Against the Wall and Freestyle Love-that earned rave reviews and sold extremely well , much to the amazement of the publishing industry .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
Protection of the local industry has become a leitmotif of the communist authorities ' video policy since 2000 . Fostered by the government , TV series have indeed seen rapid progress . Not only have they developed a distinct dramatic style native to China , they have also taken control of the viewership , and the high rate of return on investment is driving the development of the entire TV industry . Stations in every province are forming into groups that are capable of holding their own against the CCTV .  
In contrast , the enormous expenses of the two dialysis centers in Malaysia are covered entirely locally by donations from grateful patients and the money raised by local volunteers through small donations and recycling of waste . Wang Yun-ching relates that most people have the mistaken idea that all Tzu Chi volunteers are Buddhists . In fact , those handling medical duties for Tzu Chi branch organizations around the world include persons of many different faiths .  
" Although the pattern in international medical aid is to offer long-term aid at fixed locations , the TRMPC will at least for the near future continue its approach of not adopting any fixed location , but of doing volunteer care deep in those areas that local medical systems do not reach , " says TRMPC President Liu Chi-chun . Like explorers on the Discovery Channel , the TRMPC 's tramping through the developing world has yielded some valuable academic discoveries .  
The reception was led by a heavyweight local political figure : former Ho Chi Minh City mayor Nguyen Vinh Nghiep . After retiring as mayor , Nguyen , a Vietnam War hero , went into charity work , setting up the HCM Sponsor Association for Poor Patients , which raises funds both inside and outside Vietnam to assist low-income Vietnamese with medical problems such as oral clefts , blindness , burns and congenital deformities . Over the past years the charity has achieved remarkable results .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
While promoting his film in Taiwan , Zhang and local director Hou Hsiao-hsien engaged in a lengthy chat about their " ideal " martial arts film at Taipei Film House . Zhang pointed out that his film was set in the time immediately before the first Qin emperor had unified all of China . At that moment in history , it would have been impossible for people to foresee his eventual transformation into a tyrant ; therefore , the assassin is able to place trust in the emperor .  
Part of the problem is that education reform has been conducted without a clear objective , with schemes adopted helter-skelter , and with countless cooks ending up spoiling the broth . Also to blame is the simultaneous and zealous pursuit of globalization and localization by both local and central governments . The result is that the book bags carried by Taiwanese children have become enormous , and the psychological pressure equally weighty .  
One area of particular difficulty has been the decision to promote the simultaneous learning of local and international languages , intended both to strengthen local consciousness and as a response to global trends . This approach has dramatically increased the pressure on children , leaving many unsure about the relative importance of different languages .  
Lin Ku-fang , director of the graduate institute of arts at Fo Guang University , makes the point that using one 's mother tongue springs from a natural emotional link to a locality and its history . It should n't be blown up out of proportion , and there is no need for special classes to teach it . Others have questioned whether local language education has turned into an ideological tool utilized by the state , and suggested that in the long run its use as a political tool will undermine the learning of local languages .  
In an atmosphere of fear and doubt , there is good news : The Ministry of Economic Affairs ' ( MOEA ) recently initiated program to attract foreign conglomerates to set up " R &amp; D innovation centers " in Taiwan has met with a resounding response . A number of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) have taken substantive action to show that they still feel positive about Taiwan , providing a soothing balm to local nerves .  
It 's just that in comparison with the enormously powerful TNCs , domestic companies are still the runts of the litter , and only venture into relatively mature directions in their R &amp; D . Because it is impossible to alter this " hand-me-down-ism " in the short run , it is in Taiwan 's interest that foreign R &amp; D pace-setters are here , because future international industrial trends will be clearer , and local R &amp; D centers can avoid unnecessary detours .  
Each occasion of volunteer clinical services sponsored by Tzu Chi starts with sowing seeds at the local level . Assistance is not limited to medical care , moreover , but uses an integrated-team model that allows Tzu Chi operations to set down local roots , so that people can become independent and help themselves .  
Early this March , Tzu Chi branches from Singapore , Malaysia , Indonesia , and Taiwan joined together for Tzu Chi 's fourth free clinic on the Indonesian island of Batam . On each occasion so far , the number of local volunteers has grown , and patients and their families who have been helped in previous years have come forward on their own to lend a hand . At the clinic site , you can hear Mandarin Chinese , English , Indonesian , Malaysian , and Hokkien rising and falling .  
Dr . Latifah , participating in the clinic , notes that there are many small islands around Batam , and medical resources , inadequate to begin with , are also scattered . Given the great distance from Jakarta , the political and economic heart of Indonesia , local residents must travel far across the water for treatment . Often minor illnesses are ignored until they become major ones , and patients with serious problems deteriorate over time because they can not afford the enormous costs of seeking treatment .  
The most common complaint for children is respiratory infections . This is because local residents have not yet learned to pay close attention to public health norms . People spit wherever they want , while the houses let in little sunlight and have poor ventilation , so children are much more likely to get infected and it is correspondingly difficult to cure them .  
During this fourth clinic of Tzu Chi 's held on Batam , altogether 901 patients were helped by the combined efforts of more than 150 Tzu Chi volunteers and 61 doctors from the medical association , as well as 9 local doctors and 52 local volunteers . In addition , more than a dozen volunteers from other Chinese Buddhist organizations also joined in or helped in transporting patients from offshore islands .  
Li says that in Indonesia , where anti-Chinese sentiment is intense , the fact that Tzu Chi often lends a hand is gradually changing local attitudes toward Chinese . Now , if you go out wearing the " blue sky and white clouds " volunteer uniform of Tzu Chi , people will always greet you with a smile .  
He eventually discovered that the paper most suitable for sky lanterns was the kind used under the steamed turtle buns presented as an offering to the Lord of Heaven on the ninth day of the first lunar month . And so every year on the eve of the Lantern Festival he would volunteer to work at the local cake shop in exchange for a few sheets of uncut white paper .  
The 1990s were a decade of great political , social , and economic change in Taiwan . Against this backdrop contemporary Taiwanese artists were active participants in the global fashion for installation art , integrating an essentially Western conceptual skeleton with an indigenous or local skin .  
According to Clio Chi , executive director of the Eastern Culture Foundation , once given the opportunity to show their talent , Aboriginal children invariably end up surprising everybody . After the foundation started funding Paling Elementary School , a school in Taoyuan County attended by Aboriginal children , that school 's website soon took first place in a nationwide contest and even became an outlet for online sales of the peaches grown on Lala Mountain , thus helping to spearhead local economic development .  
She confidently points out that her own English pronunciation is accurate , and she is capable of leading classroom activities , knows how to prepare a curriculum , and understands the background of local students . On the other hand , " foreign teachers are n't necessarily superior instructors because they do n't have experience teaching Taiwanese students , and they are n't as sensitive to the kinds of linguistic difficulties that Taiwanese students encounter , " Lu says .  
While this is not the case with the SARS epidemic-there are press conferences almost every day at every level of government from the premier down to local government officials , as well as at all major hospitals , so that there is considerable information available-SARS has still had an impact of unprecedented scope , with related issues that include the quarantine of over 10,000 people , sealing of hospitals and neighborhoods , closing of schools , creation of dedicated facilities , proper use and distribution of masks and protective clothing , and economic aid to affected industries .  
For example , some community workers in Hsiufeng Village in Luku Rural Township started a business with only NT $ 500,000 in capital to repackage Luku tea leaves in an elegant and appealing way , and by playing on the heartwarming story behind the sale of the tea : paying for the continued operation of a cafeteria for local elderly people who live alone .  
As a result some schools were able to establish strategic alliances with both public and independent junior high schools and with industry in Malaysia . As well as providing scholarships to encourage students to study in Taiwan , vocational colleges will in future also allow teachers to visit Malaysia to engage in cooperative programs with local firms to assist them in enhancing their technology .  
Ching Ching Farm in central Taiwan is also driving local economic growth . It offers activities like getting up-close with the sheep herd there , and there is also the attraction of nearby peach and apple orchards . Nearby , not only are there rows of restaurants opened by locals , but even the international chains 7-11 and Starbucks coffee houses have opened outlets , leading to a perfect fusion of the romance of the sheep ranch with the consumer habits of the visitors .  
WHO experts assisted us in devising standard operating procedures and in inspecting the management and control measures in place in 17 major teaching hospitals , including staff training , protective equipment , proper setup of negative pressure rooms , transportation of patients , and so forth . The teaching hospitals then inspected 69 regional hospitals , which , in turn , inspected 400 local hospitals . In this way , hundreds of hospitals throughout Taiwan were inspected in less than three weeks .  
With the debate , two factions-one mainland , one Taiwanese-became apparent within Taiwanese literature . In the tumultuous times immediately following the war , the leading lights of the local literary scene who were still writing or editing fell on hard times , with most of those who did n't retire ending up either in jail or dead .  
" In addition to shaping and achieving goals , it 's also important to fill people 's bellies , " says Lee . He notes that after Taiwan joined the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) , local factories moved abroad and unemployment became a serious problem . Consequently , the community development program will only be judged a success if it is able to revive the community and resolve residents ' economic difficulties . With that in mind , the development of distinctive local industries has been an urgent concern .  
The 10 kite-makers the program has trained since 2002 have done quite well . Under resident master kite-maker Lee Hou-jui 's tutelage , local mothers have not only learned a craft and acquired a source of income , but now also travel to schools all over Taiwan teaching students how to make kites . They were also very successful at last year 's National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports ' Kite Contest , where they won several prizes .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
After local people began to gather here in large numbers , the " Fangliao Good Life Society " was established to promote artistic and literary events in the community . A resounding success , in 1998 the site was voted a national model for the improvement of urban landscapes .  
In 1994 , led by teachers Lu Hung-wen and Huang Kuei-kuan , a group of students from the Peitou Elementary School investigated the natural resources of their local area . They sought out documented information on the " Peitou Hot Springs Public Baths , " which have close ties with the development of Peitou itself . From this information , they discovered that the long-forgotten , overgrown , and run-down " haunted house " was in fact the site of that very same pool complex , Southeast Asia 's largest and most luxurious public pool in its day .  
" The literary level of its readers has an influence on a publishing company 's ambition , " says Wu Hsing-wen , Beijing representative of Yuan-Liou Publishing and long-time observer of the publishing scene on both sides of the Taiwan Strait . Taiwanese readers are punctilious in their choices , but they are also very receptive , which is why local publishers can make bold and experimental market forays . It is also the reason Taiwanese books are successful in terms of content and set trends for the Chinese reading public around the world .  
You can see incorrect usage wherever you look . I 'll give you some examples . After mainland tour groups started coming to Taiwan , I was hired to train local tour guides .

Thinking back on his career as a local official , Lin says that as the representative of the county executive and spokesperson for the county government , he was tied down by countless details and small tasks .

His life , previously lived amidst books and with quiet time for contemplation , was now continually interrupted by odds and ends .  
On September 13 , the Ministry of Education held the National Education Development Conference .

Currently other localities are lining up to threaten the use of referendums to give expression to local aspirations . For example , Hsihu Township in Miaoli County is seeking to have a Hsihu exit built on the Central Second Freeway , Wulai Rural Township in Taipei County is demanding that the government abolish the toll booths that collect environmental maintenance fees in the Wulai Scenic Area , Penghu County is demanding the opening of tourist casinos , etc . In no time at all the referendum seems to have become the convenient new favorite for solving deadlocked disputes .  
Over the past four years , the Parisanan Association has undertaken many activities to promote this matter . They have successively mobilized 10,000 people to sign a petition , held talks with local elders to get their agreement , paid formal visits to senior officials to seek their backing , scouted out the track foundations , and made written proposals . After a long , uphill battle , they have finally got the attention of the county government , who then evaluated their plan .  
Of course , the war was not in the least affected by the protest . But it is gratifying that on this subject at least there was a broad consensus among local feminist organizations , returning to the basic starting points of the women 's movement : love , peace , justice , and human rights . Perhaps it is by returning to basic humane values that the women 's movement in Taiwan will enjoy a resurgence .

Having tried all kinds of domestic and foreign railway lunches , Taiwan Railway Culture Association administrative director Hsieh Ming-hsun says that of all the foreign railway lunches available , he considers Japan 's to be the best . They 're also often tied in with the special features of the local area-for example , seaside stations offer seafood lunches . Also , the lunch boxes come in all sorts of different designs , from cane baskets to ceramic boxes . When he visited Japan , he brought back several extraordinary lunch boxes as souvenirs .  
Aside from the massive popularity of the Nostalgia Lunches , domestic convenience store chains are also paying attention to this virgin market . Starting a couple of years ago , one after another they started offering different kinds of local packed lunches , starting a " biandang war , " - one would offer theirs for NT $ 40 , so a competitor would drop theirs to NT39 , all promoting their lower prices .  
Because of US bombing raids during World War II , the Japanese instituted a policy of dispersal . When Chiu was six the whole family was moved to his maternal grandmother 's house in Tunghsiao Township , Miaoli County . American and Japanese planes would frequently engage in dogfights overhead , and each time the aerial battles finished , the local residents would go to the waterside in search of aluminum and plexiglas . The pieces of aluminum could be cut and trimmed into rice spatulas , and the plexiglas could be turned into toys .  
Chiu held onto a spirit of " releasing the spirit tied up by the cities and returning to the peaceful , simple life of the country . " Putting features of Taiwanese scenery-whether from Lanyu , Penghu , or Chiufen-into his paintings , he came at his topics from a critical angle . Rather than making comparisons about beauty or ugliness , he relied on inner feeling-taking his melancholy and concerns about the transformation of the local landscape and revealing them for everyone to see on his canvases .  
Currently , the country as a whole recycles an average of almost 15% of all kitchen waste .

Because of this , creative education has been established as a four-year pilot project with an annual budget of NT $ 60 million . In spirit , it will encourage diversification , differentiation , and maybe even a little rebellion and mischief . In practical terms , whether in innovation in educational methods , reform in educational materials , innovation in student performance or in reforming and restructuring campus spaces , any good ideas will receive support . And because this effort is a local , piecemeal , gradual bottom-up process , it will not encounter much opposition .  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
Just after finishing his studies and completing his military service in 1985 , Hsu competed in a global trek around the globe sponsored by a local daily newspaper , the Independence Evening Post . After circling the globe , Hsu settled into the stable life of a salaryman .

Already it seems like people are forgetting this important part of Taiwan 's history .  
In the old days , the wealthy regarded artistic brickwork , and wood and stone carvings , as ways to decorate their houses and flaunt their wealth . The last two have stayed as large parts of local culture , but brickwork somehow fell out of favor , and so Liao set herself to reviving brickworking as a living part of the culture .  
This is part of the reason that Liao 's husband Chang Cheng-yuen decided to get involved in the brickmaking industry , even though he never had any contact with it as a child . In fact , Chang has developed a repertoire of over 70 different styles of brick , and his exquisite workmanship has even attracted clients like McDonald 's , who contracted him to build the local outlet a pond and a set of brickwork golden arches . Having such a major company recognise their work has encouraged Liao and Chang immensely .

Initiatives include increased research in the understanding of processes involved in climate , its variability , drought occurrence and desertification ; a new interactive database for use by local people and decision makers ; a new experimental network data project on river flow regimes in parts of Africa ; and the development of national environmental information systems .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Mountain farming furthermore relies on the exploitation of highly variable and complex ecological niches , where local knowledge is often superior to what extension agents can offer based on research and experience derived from extensive lowland farming systems .  
A major development in government policy concerning mountain communities is the increased understanding of the importance of local control over natural resource management and security of resources , especially land tenure , as the main incentives for investment in environmentally sound technologies and improved land husbandry .  
The support units seem widespread - they are responsible for developing local guidelines for national execution , training line ministries on national execution procedures , preparing the required national execution reports , facilitating contractual arrangements with cooperating and implementation agencies and generally providing support to the technical ministries hosting nationally executed programmes .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
Governments should promote the active involvement of the local community in all stages of planning and management of natural resource use for productive activity , through a grass-roots approach , including the encouragement of user groups , particularly for women ; delivery of new technologies should be carried out using a participatory systems approach , with special attention to targeting investment on intended beneficiary groups , where appropriate .  
The Committee suggests that the State party take steps to ensure the effective coordination between the existing institutions involved in the areas of human rights and children 's rights with a view to establishing a monitoring mechanism for the implementation of the Convention at the national , regional and local levels , which may assess the actual situation of children and narrow the gap between the law and its practice .  
The Committee recommends that the State party strengthen the coordination between the different governmental mechanisms involved in human rights and children 's rights , at both the national and local levels , and ensure a closer cooperation with non-governmental organizations , with a view to developing a comprehensive policy on children and ensuring an effective evaluation of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the country .  
As in previous thematic discussions , there was recognition of the urgent importance of gathering information and gender-disaggregated data , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels , with a view to assessing the prevailing reality affecting girls , identifying persisting problems and challenging the prevalence of invisibility , which in turn allows for the perpetuation of vulnerability .  
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
Increase budgetary allocations for basic health and social services , with adequate support for secondary and tertiary levels , and give special attention to the health of girls and women and to rural health programmes ; ( b ) Develop innovative approaches to funding health services through promoting community participation and local financing .

Calls upon all States to encourage the broad-based participation of local authorities and all relevant actors , including the scientific community , industry , trade unions , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , in the national , regional and international preparatory process and to encourage a wide exchange of information and experience in this respect , in particular on the programmes of work and activities of national committees ;  
In synthesis , the fifth country programme aims at developing , piloting and building within six local impact areas , capacities and systems for a participatory approach to development that will enable the poor to benefit from basic social services , resources and advice necessary for the enhancement of their productivity and improvement of their standard of living .  
The science addressed in chapter 35 is intended to provide the knowledge base for sustainable development and must therefore be designed to cover all facets of the complex problems of environment and development as they appear at the global , regional , and local levels .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .  
The investigation of the complaint would require questioning suspects , victims and witnesses , collecting documentary and other forensic evidence , ensuring that appropriate chains of custody of evidence are maintained , conducting searches , conducting mass grave exhumations where necessary , undertaking local inquiries and coordinating with various national authorities and other investigation agencies .  
It contains a menu of action-oriented recommendations directed towards civil society , labour , business , local governmental authorities , national Governments and international organizations .  It organizes these recommendations under three broad categories : improving understanding and analysis ; applying tools for modifying behaviour ; and monitoring , evaluating and reviewing performance .  
Initial results indicate that there is great potential for expanding such programmes since participating households are not only contributing to environmental protection and better quality of life but also achieving savings in monetary terms .  The experience also points to the need for support from local authorities , such as refunding unused sanitation charges to households , so that concrete benefits can accrue to both households and local governments .  
Full participation of all will require the creation of an enabling political environment , decentralization of decision-making to the local level , and explicit measures to empower the poor in general and women in particular , so that they may be able to include their socio-economic priorities in national , regional and local development plans and participate fully in the implementation of those plans ;  
The practical strategy which the General Assembly adopted in 1992 entitled " global targets on ageing for the year 2001 " ( comprising global and national sections ) provides a useful organizational tool at the global level for supporting regional , national and local actions .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
Encourage major groups working in the population / gender field and in other sustainable development fields to increase their communication , cooperation and coordination at the local , regional and international levels in order to reinforce their contribution to the mutual understanding of these issues and to facilitate their active participation in the implementation of chapter 5 of Agenda 21 and chapter III of the Programme of Action ;  
Under the heading " strengthening support for families " , proposed actions would be arranged according to the principal actors concerned : national Governments ; regional or local governments ; the private sector ; non-governmental organizations at different levels ; research and academic institutions ; the media .  
The calculation of common staff costs for international and local staff is based on the standard cost rates referred to in annex II , paragraph 6 , as detailed in annex X . This provision is reduced by 50 per cent of the estimated cost of repatriation travel of international staff shown in paragraph 9 below in a separate budget line item ( $ 127,800 ) .  
The instrument may be designed and established at the national level , specific emission levels set by local authorities , with monitoring and money collecting conducted by regional inspectorates .  
Concerning the proposals for action , the Working Group suggested that the Commission consider encouraging countries , with the support of the international community , to prepare and initiate implementation of comprehensive national mountain development programmes and to strengthen national capacity for sustainable mountain development using a participatory approach involving all stakeholders , including local and indigenous communities and non-governmental organizations .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;  
Create and modify programmes and policies that recognize and strengthen women 's vital role in food security and provide paid and unpaid women producers , especially those involved in food production , such as farming , fishing and aquaculture as well as urban enterprises , with equal access to appropriate technologies , transportation , extension services , marketing and credit facilities at the local and community levels ;  
UNMIH will then gradually expand its presence in each of the operational zones by deploying conventional forces to base camps that will be constructed throughout the country and by actively patrolling from the base camps to ensure that the local governmental , social , and economic institutions can operate unhindered .  
Continued engagement and commitment by all Haitian parties to the successful organization of free , fair and peaceful legislative and local elections in June , a crucial step in consolidating democracy , is another key priority .  
It will also promote minimization , re-use and environmentally sound treatment and disposal of waste and sewage through provision of information strategies , tools and instruments for improved waste management and enhanced capabilities at national and local level for solid and liquid waste management .

Information services continue to focus on meeting the increasing needs of the media , both at Headquarters and at the local level , for timely , comprehensive , balanced and reliable accounts of the proceedings of meetings of United Nations organs and major important United Nations conferences , as well as of activities of the Organization and the Secretary-General .  
The resource growth is attributable to ( a ) acquisition of the specialized automation equipment required for development of local area network in the Department under the responsibility of the Information Support Unit ( $ 55,000 ) , and ( b ) additional requirements for replacement of existing equipment of the Department under the global programme of technological innovations ( $ 113,900 ) .  
To promote decentralization of governmental decision-making , local self-governance , improved municipal administration , restructuring of civil service , public sector reforms , indigenous entrepreneurship and national capacity-building ;  
As a result , the Governments of Belarus , Bulgaria , the Czech Republic , Lithuania , Poland , the Russian Federation and the Slovak Republic have requested UNDP and ILO to assist them in the development of institutions and human resources , and the strengthening of various skills such as managerial , educational , entrepreneurial , human and institutional structures at the local level .  
An innovative programme has been designed to assist indigenous peoples in developing their own strategies , based on traditional knowledge , for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and habitat preservation while yielding economic benefits for the support of local populations .  
In order to ensure an integrated approach to the complexity of mountain ecosystems and the socio-economic issues at stake , the Commission recognizes the need for strengthening the existing institutional mechanisms as well as the knowledge base about mountain ecosystems through research , database development , pilot projects and information exchange , along with support for training in-country of scientific and technical experts and local natural resource managers .  
Special attention is drawn to the need for improved delivery of information to decision makers and to increased participation in environmental observations at the local and national levels within regional and international frameworks .  
Since then , the country has removed strategic and tactical nuclear weapons , closed scores of bases and demobilized many thousands of military personnel , transferring to local authorities the responsibility of providing them with housing and basic services .  
The Commission notes with concern that the growing recognition of the need to address patterns of production and consumption has not yet been matched by a full understanding of the implications of such patterns on economic , social and environmental conditions at the local , national and global levels .  
Particularly in recommendation 9 , it has stressed the urgent need to gather data and disaggregated information on a gender basis , in a comprehensive and integrated manner , at the international , regional , national and local levels with a view to assessing the current reality of women , identifying persistent problems and challenging the invisibility of women 's human rights .  
Open : in its conception , preparation and convening , the Summit involved all nations as well as a large number of public and private institutions and organizations , placing particular emphasis on the poor , weak and vulnerable , not only to address their problems but also to give them a voice in local , national and international forums . 
The UNV programme has consistently sought to promote participatory processes by using appropriate volunteer modalities , including mixed teams of international and national personnel , and by creating direct linkages between UNV specialists and local populations .  
National participating organizations would be expected to constitute teams of qualified volunteers ( perhaps focusing on a limited number of areas of coverage identified by each organization ) , assure their specialized training and facilitate the rapid deployment and integration of such teams , including the building of linkages with local non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations in the receiving countries .  
Ensuring a modicum of the sense of the individual , local , and national security : peaceful political and favourable national and international economic conditions . "  
With regard to the institution-building process , it was said that despite the many daily problems and challenges , the institutional development should not be carried out on an ad hoc basis , but be seen in its local , regional and national dimensions , which required strategic thinking and vision .  
Measures to foster effective provision of infrastructure services by local government included ( a ) establishing a rational , transparent , legal foundation for local government with an appropriate degree of local discretion over issues of local interest ; ( b ) implementing a more appropriate assignment of revenues providing greater local autonomy over user charges and local taxes ; and ( c ) introducing more systematic and transparent criteria for allocating capital investment funding .  
Secondly , the Indian Administrative Service ( IAS ) has established a professional corps of educated public administrators who share a common background of professional training , accept a common set of responsibilities towards developing the capacities of the citizenry in their jurisdictions , and represent a strong presence of the national Government in state and local jurisdictions .  
In addition to selecting schools to be upgraded or built , the issue of equity between regions and genders should be assessed , with studies on selected policy matters , such as reducing imbalances for disadvantaged groups and increasing internal efficiency , in order to enable policy makers to make decisions based on in-depth analyses of local conditions and on comparative analysis of countries facing similar problems .  
The authorized staffing level for international and local staff during the period under review reflected a reduction of 28 posts ( 12 international and 16 local staff ) in the number of additional temporary personnel proposed in the cost estimate and amounted to a total of 309 international and 591 local staff .  
Ensuring the backstopping of essential human freedoms such as acceptably peaceful and equitable political , economic and social environments that promote individual , local and national security .  
Both the " vertical " articulation from local level up to national ( e.g . school districts to national ministries of education ) , and the formal interactions " horizontally " between various elements of service delivery ( e.g . local education authorities , public health infrastructures , non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations ) at each level are fundamental to a well integrated human resource development structure and process .  
It has actively involved local , regional and national education authorities , teachers , parents , students , potential employers , non-governmental organizations and regional public and private institutions / organizations that can assist in the designing and testing of the new curriculum .  
Follow-up initiatives should be effectively linked ( a ) across social sectors , and with other key government sectors such as finance , trade , and industry / commerce ; ( b ) between governmental and non-governmental and private agencies and organizations ; and ( c ) reflective of local and community needs through a deeply decentralized functional pattern of operation .  
The impact of written material was reduced as a result of low literacy rates throughout the country ; local radio and television facilities were old , in bad repair and had limited range .  
Despite the repeated appeals by the President of the Republic , Dr . Franjo Tudjman and the Croatian Government to the local Serbian population to lay down their arms and stay in their homes , as well as promises and guarantees of amnesty and abolition to all those who have not committed war crimes , and renewed guarantees for the safety and constitutional rights of the Serb ethnic community in Croatia , a large number of Serb civilians in the liberated areas have left their homes .  
We call upon the authorities in Zagreb to hold inviolate the civil and human rights of the local Serb population and to treat all prisoners of war in accordance with accepted standards of international law governing the rights of military personnel in conflict situations .  
Among the points of discussion were the recruitment of students to central or local mine-clearance training schools ; the need for expatriate staff or technical advisers to stay on after the initial establishment of a national demining programme ; a recommendation that the United Nations provide pre-tailored material for new demining operations , including standard operating procedures , training and materials .

FAO continues to contribute actively to desertification control , drought preparedness and mitigation and integrated dry land development in affected countries .  
In general , the United Nations system should be able to help Governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experiences and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
If differences among countries ' living standards are the focus of the comparison , then a purchasing-power parity ( PPP ) exchange rate is regarded as the most appropriate method , as it values the commodities and services sold in each country at a set of common international prices , rather than at local prices multiplied by the value of the national currency determined in the foreign exchange market .  
The methodological problems inherent in such studies are unlikely to be resolved without recourse to adequate data on the numbers and types of migrants present at the local level , the use that they actually make of public services , and their contribution to government revenue at national , state and local levels .  
Enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures ;

The low proportion of women among economic and political decision makers at the local , national , regional and international levels reflects structural and attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed through positive measures .  
The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Seminars and training programmes were to be organized on the prevention of crime in urban and other areas , and sound crime prevention strategies developed , capable of being adapted to local conditions , with particular reference to the approaches suggested at the relevant workshops held during the Ninth Congress .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
More effective strategies must be devised against recalcitrant problems , such as rapidly escalating organized , economic and environmental crime , and action efforts pursued at multiple levels - international , regional , national and , with the trend towards decentralization , local as well .  
Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , and sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
The humanitarian situation , which is particularly difficult , the observance of human rights , which can neither be renounced nor evaded , and the capacity of the local police to be effective , impartial and professional , are all important issues which must be addressed , on a priority basis , and for which we will also support efforts to show the commitment and the support of the international community .

Thus , contemporary United States domestic law on federal , state and local levels provides strong protections against racial discrimination in all fields of public endeavour and in many areas of private life .  
Second , the strategy to be pursued must be based on growth with equity , the full participation of all actors in development , including civil society , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the poor themselves , and should involve a decentralized approach in which decisions and resources allocation can be made at the local level , taking into account the specific conditions and needs of the target groups or areas .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector .

One of these goals , formulated in the founding resolution of the Decade ( resolution 44 / 236 ) , is to provide by the year 2000 ready access for all countries to global , regional , national and local warning systems and the possibility of broad dissemination of warnings . 
Depending on the nature of the hazard , the location of vulnerable people and assets , and designated responsibilities for action , elements of warning systems may be organized and implemented at local , national , regional or international levels .  
The mechanism , an open-ended interdisciplinary and inter-agency working process , would provide a collective operating framework to direct a credible and effective application of early warning within disaster management at all levels , in particular in support of local communities at risk from natural and similar disasters ;  
National Governments of all countries are encouraged to undertake a systematic assessment of the extent to which current international , regional and national warning systems adequately address their own requirements to provide ready access to warnings for all citizens , and particularly those living in local communities most exposed to hazards .  
Based on this research , a training programme has been developed to strengthen national and regional capacity for strategic development policy analysis , focusing on tools and techniques that incorporate the local cultural and social context for evaluating the socio-economic driving forces of structural change . 
The Programme of Action calls on Governments to increase public efforts to eradicate absolute poverty and to reduce overall poverty substantially , inter alia , by formulating or strengthening , preferably by 1996 , and implementing national poverty eradication plans to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels . 
The eradication of poverty requires a sustained , collective commitment and effort by national and local governments , civil society , business and corporations , supported by the international community , including in particular , regional and international organizations ;

The average monthly cost for the previous period was $ 5,000 , but requirements for the current period are expected to be much higher because , while some of these services were covered under the logistic support services contract during the last mandate , the new service contract does not provide for them , thus requiring use of local contractors to provide these services .  
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are : more frequent , and a larger variety of , mission opportunities ; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base ; greater involvement of local industry ; and greater diversification of potential users .  
The United Nations system 's operational activities for rehabilitation during the past year have focused on assisting local communities in rural infrastructure , food production , health improvement , animal health services , rehabilitation of disabled people and human settlements .  The main underlying purpose of these activities is poverty alleviation and human development .  
In that connection , activities that could improve the operational use of space technology were the establishment of local receiving stations , increased accessibility to environmental data and the stimulation of data sharing between international , regional and national organizations and agencies .  
The additional requirements of $ 3,165,000 reported under this heading were mainly attributable to the following : ( a ) an amount equivalent to one month 's salary ( $ 885,500 ) was paid to 1,454 local staff in lieu of notice ; and ( b ) an amount of $ 2,197,400 was recorded in the reporting period in respect of salaries paid to the local staff in the previous mandate periods .

Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
The existence of landmines and other undetonated explosive devices in various regions of the world is a tremendous humanitarian problem and a grave threat to the security , health and survival of the local population where these deadly devices have been scattered .  These devices prevent the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes in the States affected by this ongoing menace and impede humanitarian operations and programmes , national reconstruction and economic development activities and peacekeeping operations .  
In this setting of globalization and interdependence , the United Nations with its universal composition , its agglutinative structure that brings together countries at the most varied levels of human development and ethnic or religious composition , its institutional capacity to act as a point of articulation or a sounding board for all concerns or aspirations that extend beyond the local , national or regional level would be in an ideal position to play a leading and decisive role .  
Even though misunderstandings and aggressions appear on one continent or another , based on deep-seated racial , religious or political hatred , and leading to genocide or local wars , we can not speak of a conflagration , especially when the will of the people of all regions rises above these wars , committed to the restoration of peace .  
We believe that development challenges to any country can be met only by taking into account the global economic system as a solution that involves the development of a comprehensive framework combining international and local efforts , with a view to improving the performance of the economy in a favourable environment wherein local and regional circumstances and the priorities and special conditions of each individual State are taken into consideration .  
It is focusing on strengthening the institutional capacities of government , at both the central and local levels , with regard to policy management and poverty monitoring ; promoting human resources development by providing better access to health and education opportunities ; alleviating rural poverty ; and developing and strengthening the basic social-safety net , among other issues .  
Moreover , it is precisely in situations requiring difficult choices that the objectives , commitments and Programme of Action adopted in Copenhagen can be given specific meaning , despite various obstacles which limit the leeway of decision makers .  The objectives and commitments of the world social Summit can be inconvenient in practice , or can conflict with other priorities at the local , regional and international levels .  
Working with partners in 18 countries , USAID is undertaking a learning process designed to explore and document new ways to build capacity and linkages among groups at the local level ; to forge solid society-to-society linkages between these local groups and their United States counterparts ; and to foster a legal , regulatory and fiscal environment conducive to citizen participation and community initiative .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
We also consider very encouraging the progress made in the areas of human rights ; police training ; cooperation in regional human resources training through the United Nations University fellowships programme ; improved cooperation with the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean ( ECLAC ) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , as well as the joint programmes for international drug control aimed at harmonization at the local level of legislation and the work of the agencies responsible for this problem ; the improvement of the condition of women ;  
The presidential , legislative , regional and local elections to be held in Zaire in 1997 are an opportunity for the Belgian Government and the European Union to show their active solidarity within the framework of collective electoral assistance , which must be coordinated by the United Nations .  
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
However , the economy of the territory has not changed and the occupying authority , Israel , is continuing its old practices , which are incompatible with international law and local custom , including unjustified detention , blockades , collective punishment and the expansion of existing settlements .  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities that are sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly if State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , Governments should devise innovative privatization plans so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions performed before privatization ;

The agreement , which recognized the sovereignty of Croatia over Eastern Slavonia and guaranteed the rights of the local Serb population , represented a major step forward , and the European Union wished to pay tribute to the moderation of the leaders involved on all sides and to the efforts of United Nations personnel , the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia , and the personnel of other international organizations , who had all helped to bring about a political solution . 
Provide assistance to and involve in the implementation of the programme partners in related fields who have developed or are developing skills related to communication , local enterprises whose practical knowledge and technique on communication have been tested and confirmed , and training and research establishments that constitute regional or national centres of excellence .  
For the concepts of reproductive rights and reproductive health to be implemented at the local level , they need be integrated into existing social , political and religious structures and thus become part of the complex fabric of society .  
The collapse of the central authority also posed extreme difficulties for the protection of human rights , while the administration of justice continued to be arbitrary and local authorities were unable to prevent some sections of the population from engaging in arms dealing and trafficking in narcotics and cultural artifacts .

Responding to allegations that the armed forces of Myanmar had committed unseemly acts in border areas , he rejected them and insisted that the local population in those areas was experiencing unprecedented levels of progress in the political , economic and social fields and that the armed forces of Myanmar , which had a distinguished history and a fine tradition born of the struggle for independence , were well known for their good discipline and exemplary conduct .  
Of the initiatives taken by the High Commissioner , her delegation wished to mention , in particular , the machinery established in respect of special procedures , monitoring organs and non-governmental organizations , and especially the dialogue with Governments , since it considered that direct contacts with senior officials of Member States could only promote a better understanding of local realities and a fair appreciation of the development of the situation regarding human rights in Member States .  
37-One respondent was of the view that national master plans should incorporate an adequate demand reduction programme adjusted to local , cultural and other needs .  
On the subject of participation by women in political life , she stated that female candidates were more successful in contests at the local level , where they were known personally to voters , although the proportion of women elected to municipal assemblies had fallen from approximately 30 per cent in the 1980s to only 16 per cent in 1990 .

In Habitat II , Governments at all levels , the community and the private sector considered how the achievement of the two principal goals of " Adequate shelter for all " and " Sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world " can be furthered at the local level through an enabling process in which individuals , families and their communities play a central role .  
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Panel may also receive substantive inputs from the Convention following the third meeting of the Conference of the Parties on , inter alia , the underlying causes of biological diversity loss in forest ecosystems , components and dynamics of biological diversity , and ways and means for the effective protection and use of traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers , indigenous and local communities , as well as fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from such knowledge , innovation and practices .  
Helping to identify relevant principles , guidelines and mechanisms for countries to develop their own appropriate and effective sui generis system ( s ) , such as traditional resource rights , in order to implement article 8 ( j ) ( requiring that States " respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles " , while encouraging the " equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ) ;  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The sooner communities , local governments , partnerships among the public , and private and community sectors join efforts to create comprehensive , bold and innovative strategies for shelter and human settlements , the better the prospects will be for the safety , health and well-being of people and the brighter the outlook for solutions to global environment and social problems .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
In improving natural and human-made disaster prevention , preparedness , mitigation and response , Governments at the appropriate level , including local authorities , and in close consultation and cooperation with such entities as insurance companies , non-governmental organizations , community-based organizations , organized communities , the academic , health and scientific community , should :  
These resolutions , inter alia , demanded that the Government of the Republic of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local Serb population in the former Sectors following Croatia 's military operations , including their rights to remain , leave or return in safety , take urgent measures to put an end to all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights and investigate all reports of such violations so that those responsible for such acts be judged and punished .  
Objectives of this endeavour include protecting public health , providing for safety and security conditions , education , and social integration , promoting equality , respect for diversity and cultural identities , increased accessibility for persons with disabilities , and preservation of historic , spiritual , religious and culturally significant buildings and districts , respecting local landscapes and treating the local environment with respect and care .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
National , subnational and local policies and development plans must be carefully re-examined to ensure optimal land use and geographically better balanced economic development , including the protection of indispensable agricultural land ; land that sustains biodiversity , water quality and groundwater recharge ; fragile areas , including coastal areas ; and other sensitive areas in need of protection . 83 bis .  
Where appropriate , re-direct public resources to encourage community-based management of services and infrastructure and promote the participation of the private sector and local residents , including people living in poverty , women , people with disabilities , indigenous people and members of disadvantaged groups , in the identification of public service needs , spatial planning and the design , provision and maintenance of urban infrastructure and open and green spaces .

Provide accessible , affordable , impartial , prompt and humane local systems of justice by , inter alia , facilitating and strengthening , where appropriate , existing traditional institutions and procedures for the resolution of disputes and conflicts ; ( e bis . )  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
Undertaking the valuation of the goods and services of a forest at local , national , regional and global levels is a complex and costly exercise that must be carried out in response to specific demands and guided by the type of decisions for which the results are to be used .  
This approach provides the necessary base for moving towards sustainable land-use systems within which forests are clearly recognized as an option with its own validity in contributing to sustainability at local , national and global levels . 
One of the conclusions of that study was that it had demonstrated that a strong case could be made for forest conservation in the Mexican instance , based on local , regional and global values of forests , and that those values should be incorporated into decisions on the future management of such an important resource .  
Promoting construction methods , materials and technologies that are affordable , safe , efficient and accessible and that emphasize greater use of local materials and human resources , that encourage and support design efficiency and energy-saving methods , and that are environmentally sound and protective of human health ;  
We commit ourselves to the strategy of enabling all key actors in the public , private and community sectors to play an effective role - at national , state / provincial , metropolitan , and local levels - in human settlements and shelter development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
Using resources and economic instruments in an effective , efficient and equitable manner at the local , national , regional and international levels ;  
In a manner consistent with national legislation , seek to increase the ability of local authorities , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to link directly with global capital markets , in accordance with prudential safeguards in those markets , in order to finance their shelter and infrastructure programmes and to establish international and local mechanisms and instruments to facilitate risk sharing and credit enhancement for investing agencies - local , regional and national ;  
Encouraging multilateral development institutions and donors to support nations in their effort to pursue enabling strategies through which national and local governments , communities and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in shelter and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;

In addition to their direct social and local economic consequences , natural disasters affected the macroeconomic standing of countries , increasing debt , reducing foreign income due to loss of exports and reducing overall production outputs .  
It was stated that the objectives of an emergency monitoring system were : ( a ) to provide national protection agencies and relevant research institutions with information to support strategic and emergency decisions ; ( b ) to re-establish the telecommunications and environmental data collection systems when an event had occurred in order to coordinate the local relief operations from the coordinating centre and to collect real-time environmental data ; and ( c ) to assess real-time and a posteriori damages , data that would be useful for understanding the phenomenon and its consequences .  
States should develop , as a matter of priority , national environmental programmes to address the protection of the atmosphere , including major local environmental air quality issues such as urban pollution emissions from industrial complexes and accidental release of hazardous material into the atmosphere .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The FAO / ITTO Expert Meeting noted that , among others , arid and semi-arid areas of Africa and the Near East had not received attention under the international initiatives related to the identification of criteria and indicators ; and that the environmental conditions and socio-economic needs governing forest management in these areas in which forestry played an essential role in the survival and sustenance of local human populations , was likely to require special , complementary or additional considerations not evident in ongoing initiatives .  
The adoption of a comprehensive , balanced and coordinated approach at the international , national , regional and local level for dealing with illicit demand , supply and trafficking of drugs is required ( Canada , United Kingdom ) .  
The scope and scale of the role of forests in providing diverse socio-economic , environmental , industrial and cultural benefits at local , national , regional as well as global levels are now better recognized , and involve many international and regional institutions and instruments .  
There are still many areas in which research has to provide additional tools to enhance reforestation activities , including ( i ) systematic evaluation of reforestation needs ; ( ii ) better matching of the site and types of reforestation ; ( iii ) improvement of technologies designed for arid regions , greater international scientific cooperation between the countries concerned being of particular importance ; ( iv ) taking into account and using local knowledge and technologies .  
The costs relating to the military mandate total $ 30,455,700 gross ( $ 29,739,700 net ) inclusive of the Office of the Force Commander , which consists of two international staff , one at the D-2 level ( the Force Commander ) and one Field Service officer , 170 local staff , 1,230 contingent personnel , maintenance and operating costs , 142 contingent-owned vehicles , including engineering equipment , and 53 rented vehicles . 
Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels , as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment ,  
98 A series of instructional and educational meetings were held between October 1994 and June 1995 for young lawyers from Siracusa and a number of local conferences and one national seminar were held during the period under review , dealing with numerous aspects of criminal justice , including the role of justice of the peace and penal procedural matters ( priority theme C ) .  
Some mechanisms are temporary , established for the specific purpose of preparing a long-term strategy ; some have been set up within existing ministries , where coordination is developed around the preparation of periodic national strategies ; some are interdepartmental committees at the national level only ; some are consultative councils , established at both national and regional or local levels , connected institutionally ; some have both an intergovernmental committee to coordinate among regions , provinces and States , and a ministerial committee to provide a more political focus .  
This kind of interactive networking at the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels ( such as the Permanent Inter-State Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel is now acting to supplement , and in some cases replace , more traditional forms of technical cooperation .  NULLAssistance to augmenting the critical role of information for capacity-building - its generation , access , transparency and cost - has increased rapidly over the past two to three years .  
The pilot project involved field research in Mexico aimed at determining how local and foreign firm 's technological decisions were influenced by the legal framework for environmental protection in Mexico .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
The continuing presence of the international civilian personnel and local staff in the mission area during the withdrawal period is required to provide uninterrupted administrative support to the contingents and to ensure the recovery , collection , disposal and shipment of the United Nations-owned and leased assets , hand-over of rented premises , and settlement of commercial contracts and agreements with the local vendors . 
In the area of public administration , programme activities focus on strengthening administrative and organizational systems at both the central and local levels , improving management methods and practices through modern management techniques and information technology , and legal frameworks and programmes that are sensitive to the global economy .  
Noting with interest that the Government of Nigeria , on 1 October 1995 , affirmed the principle of multi-party democracy , announcing its intent to accept the principle of power-sharing , lift the ban on political activity and the press , devolve power to local levels of government and subordinate the military to civilian authority , but disappointed that only limited action in this regard has followed ,  
Because it is not always easy in Tajikistan to distinguish between political violence , violent crime and violence arising from private disagreements , UNMOT personnel located at team sites endeavour , in the exercise of their good offices , to resolve minor incidents at the local level while keeping their superior at headquarters informed . 
The cost of the mission for the 12-month period amounts to $ 7,302,500 gross ( $ 6,795,200 net ) and provides for 44 military observers , maintenance and operating costs for 38 United Nations-owned vehicles , one air support helicopter and one fixed-wing aircraft for supply purposes and overall logistic support and civilian support of 24 international and 35 local staff .  
The increase in the cost of spare parts , repairs and maintenance is attributable to frequent vehicle breakdowns caused by mountainous terrain , rough road conditions in the Mission area , dispersed locations of outstations , inadequate local availability of spare parts and mechanical skill .  
The Advisory Committee inquired as to the administrative , organizational and resource requirements for UNFICYP 's humanitarian activities and was informed that a military unit comprising from 15 to 20 personnel , including civilian local level staff , was involved in this activity . 
As indicated in the executive summary of the report of the Secretary-General , the cost estimate of $ 17.1-million gross provides for a strength of 135 military observers and 139 civilian staff ( 64 international and 75 local ) and reflects " a moderate increase over the prior period " .  
A decentralized system of information dissemination with outlets at national and regional level is therefore essential when dealing with inquiries about local environmental and regulatory conditions .  
In addition to the common staff costs for international and local staff which were calculated based on standard scales , provision is also made for the repatriation of 80 international staff at the end of the Mission at the rate of $ 1,400 per person inclusive an allowance for 100 kilograms of unaccompanied excess baggage ( $ 112,000 ) . 
While endeavouring to achieve maximum efficiency in the restructuring of the Division , equal consideration was given to the need to strengthen selected areas of administration and support services in the light of prevailing operational demands experienced by the Mission . 31 .  The Committee , in paragraph 18 of its report , requested that a review be undertaken of the requirements of the Public Information Section for 36 posts ( 25 international and 11 local ) .  
In the light of the review of the overall staffing structure of the civilian administration of UNAVEM and its current operational requirements , the proposed staffing reflects an increase of 57 international posts ( 3 P-3 , 5 P-2 / P-1 , 27 General Service ( Other level ) and 22 Field Service ) which is offset by a decrease of 57 posts ( 5 General Service ( Principal level ) and 52 local ) , the total number of staff remaining at its currently authorized level of 714 .  
There is also a need to provide a selected number of centres with portable recording and radio feed equipment that can help them relay radio news to local broadcasters as well as transmit to Headquarters material gathered in their respective regions .  Recommendation 5 , Diversifying DPI audiovisual materials .  
Hence the focus on driving forces , sectoral strategies , and resource management must be combined with the monitoring of the impact on levels of living ( as measured by the incidence of poverty ) , quality of life , health and education status , environmental risks at the local , national and global level , and similar variables .  
It is essential to define , at the national , regional and local levels , a family support programme that is based on the principle of equal sharing of family responsibilities and is consistent with the policies for promoting equality in the labour market and protecting the rights of the child .  
This responsibility is reflected in the adoption of an integrated approach at the local and national levels in order to ensure access to affordable and reliable services for the children and dependants ( particularly those who are elderly and disabled ) of women and men who are working , undergoing training , studying or seeking employment .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
In addition , at the local community level around mine-sites , companies are providing enhancement to existing schooling programmes , health-care programmes - both medical and dental , including preventative care programmes and support through provision of social workers and also providing physical infrastructure such as water-wells , schools , health clinics and recreational facilities .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
Reforms are slowly taking hold , and in the countries where the reforms are most advanced , perceptible improvements in the business environments are noticeable , and the private sector is responding through increased direct investment in the minerals sector with a corresponding multiplier effect into the economy , i.e . with job creation , the development of local small - and medium-sized enterprises and capacity building in physical , social and economic infrastructure .  
The Committee recommended that the report include an evaluation of the importance of small-scale mining in the economies of developing countries and the economies in transition , as well as an analysis of new approaches and developments , focusing on the roles of local communities , the private sector , foreign capital and joint ventures , and also highlighting recent results obtained in specific areas of activity .  NULLThe present report is part of a continuing assessment of the field of small-scale mining by the Committee on Natural Resources .  
Cooperation and assistance can take a variety of forms , including joint ventures with local entrepreneurs in mining and the provision of ancillary supplies and services ; initiating complementary work and marketing relationships with indigenous small-scale producers ; lending expertise to both the Government and producers ; voluntarily returning marginal or small deposits to the national mineral inventory ; and joint or sole sponsoring of demonstration projects , training programmes or mining schools .  
All who spoke on the topic stressed that technical assistance benefited not only developing countries , but the international community at large , since it contributed to creating conditions favourable to peace and stability . 1 During the debate , it was pointed out that technical assistance had to respond promptly to the needs and the priorities of Member States , and that its modalities should reflect the local level of development , social and regional characteristics and resources . 
Among the partners in such cooperation are governments , governmental agencies , United Nations entities , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , national and local professional and scientific associations , academic institutions , private enterprises and individuals .  The present report takes into consideration the results of discussions held at the fourth session of the Commission .  
Undertaking research on effective systems and procedures in public administration , with particular attention devoted to the civil service systems , administrative structures and administrative reorganization , decentralization , aid management , accountability , financial management , metropolitan and local governance , approaches to rehabilitation and reconstruction of government and administrative services in post-conflict situations , and to ensure the timely distribution of these research results to Member States ;  
Such tools , revised to suit the local legal system and local practice , could be used at the regional and national levels and could form the basis for joint activities with other relevant international organizations .  
Urge concerned Governments , United Nations agencies and organizations , multilateral development banks , donor institutions , local communities , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and the scientific community to support the implementation of the ICRI Framework for Action , launching local or national coral reef initiatives as part of their plans for coastal integrated development and management ;  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
At its 1st plenary meeting , on 5 February , after the representative of the United States of America raised a question to which the Chairman responded , the Preparatory Committee accredited to the Conference , and its preparatory process the international associations of local authorities listed in A / CONF . 165 / PC . 3 / 2 / Add . 2 ( see annex I , decision 3 / 2 ) .  
To that end , the inventory of effective strategies , approaches , projects and programmes to reduce illicit demand and supply maintained by the Programme will be improved and expanded , and effective countermeasures tailored to local conditions against drug abuse , cultivation of illicit crops and drug trafficking will be developed .  
From a water allocation perspective , water in aquifers and rivers has to be shared on three complementary levels : ( a ) local sharing between water-dependent sectors and users ( households , industries , irrigated agriculture ) ; ( b ) urban / rural sharing ; and ( c ) upstream / downstream sharing by sequential reuse .  
In addition , in the face of the increasing integration and globalization of the world economy , Governments as well as the private sector and non-governmental organizations at the national and local levels will increasingly require policy advice , technical information and direct operational support in implementing Agenda 21 and the Habitat agenda at the urban and local levels .  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
Notes the negative social impacts on local communities , sometimes associated with the privatization of State-owned mineral assets , particularly where State mining enterprises are also involved in the maintenance of civic facilities , and concludes that , as far as possible , innovative privatization plans should be devised so that provision is made for all the economic and social functions previously performed ;  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
The driving forces behind increasingly serious water problems include rapid world population growth - in terms of both rapid urbanization and rural populations growing beyond local carrying capacity - and rising expectations and dependence on reliable water-related services to meet social needs , economic activity and food production .  
During the visit , I was able to meet with the local political leadership and express support for those who seek to implement the Peace Agreement and its vision of a single multi-ethnic country , two entities peacefully coexisting and elections that are free and fair .  
To strengthen the institutional , human resources and policy-making capabilities of Governments and communities in order to foster the effective planning and management of natural resources ; to promote an iterative and multisectoral approach to water resources management that integrates technological , socio-economic , environmental and human health considerations and involves local initiatives and participation in such development efforts ; and to formulate policies on mineral resources that encourage environmentally sound production practices ;  
In paragraph 3 of its resolution 900 ( 1994 ) of 4 March 1994 , the Security Council requested the Secretary-General to appoint , for a limited period , a senior civilian official who would draw up an overall assessment and plan of action for the restoration of essential public services in the various opstinas of Sarajevo , other than the city of Pale , and who would assist the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in close coordination with all relevant local authorities , in the implementation of the plan .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
To this end , we commit ourselves to improving the living conditions in human settlements in ways that are consonant with local needs and realities , and we acknowledge the need to address the global , economic , social and environmental trends to ensure the creation of better living environments for all people . 
Two maternal and child health / family planning projects , implemented by UNRWA in coordination with local Palestinian non-governmental organizations , made considerable progress in improving the quality of antenatal care and providing postnatal care .  
The identification of the multiple actors ( United Nations , bilaterals , multilaterals , donors , non-governmental organizations , government authorities , beneficiaries , etc . ) and multiple levels ( international , regional , national , local ) engaged in humanitarian assistance response and the appropriate coordination mechanisms for these complex interactions will be addressed .  
It is also increasingly recognized by disaster-prone country authorities and by many donors that a larger proportion of international assistance should be focused on addressing the root causes of disaster , through suitably adapted prevention and preparedness programmes which maximize the mobilization of national and especially local community resources , drawing upon the skills and expertise of all relevant regional and international agencies .  
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the second half of June 1996 .  
That had made it possible to implement policies which were better adapted to local conditions in the areas of health and education , particularly in the provinces of the North and the Iles Loyaut , controlled by the FLNKS , which had succeeded in catching up to a considerable extent in the areas of infrastructure and public services , and achieving major progress in the economic sphere .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
On instructions from my Government and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which it engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place in the first half of July 1996 .  
At national , subnational and local levels capacity-building is a key objective for several reasons : ( a ) forest management action is effected at these levels , ( b ) many countries do not have the institutional capacity to design and to implement strategies for the management of their forest resources , and ( c ) FAO and other international organizations concerned depend for their data collection on information that countries have already collected for their own purposes .  
Through the application of a relational and multidisciplinary database , a selection of economic , cultural and social variables is linked to the biophysical condition of forest resources in selected sites at the local level where periodic assessments are conducted to also observe the dynamics of change .  
Systematic and continued involvement of all concerned parties in all stages of the work , including governmental institutions , forest owners , the private sector , local and indigenous communities , indigenous and non-indigenous forest dwellers and relevant national non-governmental organizations , will be necessary in order to help ensure overall soundness of approach , timely implementation and sustainability of efforts over time .  
In areas where plantations are designed to achieve multiple purposes , especially for fulfilling subsistence needs of local populations , methodologies have to become more efficient and designed to reinforce the process of expanding forest cover .  NULLSeveral initiatives at the regional level have taken place or are planned for the near future in connection with improving the readiness to implement the Convention to Combat Desertification .  
Provided the heightened international political attention to the plight of the fragile ecosystems of drylands translates into political commitment and action at the national level , concrete , local action has the potential to become effective and transformative .  
In some rural areas , when police officers refused to deploy to outlying districts , citing lack of facilities and logistical problems , judicial and other local authorities frequently improvised by relying on locally elected officials ( CASEC ) or unofficial communal police , who sometimes worked in collaboration with HNP to carry out police duties .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
Alternative intellectual property rights regimes suitable for the needs of local communities that collectively possess TFRK have been proposed , taking into account the way in which traditional knowledge is acquired as the common property of a people and hence constitutes an integral and inalienable feature of its culture .  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
On 25 July , at around 4.30 p.m . local time in Bujumbura , my Special Representative , Mr . Marc Faguy , was informed that the armed forces had put in power a presidential candidate of their choice , deployed heavily armed units , set up roadblocks across the city and moved into the national television station .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
Faced with an increasingly heavy reliance on temporary assistance for Conference Services , resulting from growing workloads and decreasing established resources , and more recently with substantially reduced appropriations for this budget item , the Secretariat has endeavoured to maximize the use of local freelance staff and avoid payment of costly travel expenses and daily subsistence allowances , in addition to salaries . 
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
The full value of forests , wooded lands and trees and their contribution to social , economic and environmental well-being at the local , national , regional and global levels must be recognized .  
The process should build on national capacity and be based on the following characteristics , considering the situation of each country : well defined linkages to macro-level policies and policy processes ; closely linked cross-sectoral policies and issues , particularly land-use policies ; high-level political commitment and broad-based support ; participatory and decentralized planning approaches , including the use of local knowledge ; and identification and management of conflicts between relevant actors .  
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
The field office in Sarajevo was originally conceived of as a small liaison office intended , among other things , to provide support to the investigation teams , to perform liaison functions with local and national Governments and organizations in the area and to provide expert legal advice on republican and federal law in the former Yugoslavia . Following the Dayton Accord , and the increased investigative activity in the region , the critical need for increased support for the investigation teams became immediately apparent .  
These included changing mandates and constant uncertainties in the Mission , delays in budgetary authorization , delays in issuing budgetary allotments , cumbersome and inflexible procurement procedures , lack of experienced United Nations staff , frequent rotation of military personnel , difficulty in integrating military and civilian components and intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status of forces agreements . 
International and local observers take the view that principal responsibility for the continuing insecurity lies with the local police , who are either unable or unwilling to take effective action against the ongoing wave of criminal activity against the Croatian Serbs .  
Set against these positive signs are the unhelpful attitude of some hardline elements in the local Serb leadership , continuing uncertainty over the duration of the mandate of UNTAES , the need to resolve certain major policy issues if elections are to be held in February or March 1997 and questions concerning reliable assurances from the Government of Croatia for the preservation of a multi-ethnic society once the UNTAES mission ends .  
The general population 's lack of income-earning opportunities and low purchasing power , combined with increasing prices and decreased availability of basic goods on local markets , have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in Somalia .  
Impediments to training programmes abroad , which are of the highest importance in replacing expatriate personnel with local technical personnel trained in operating and managing high-technology production units ; this means depriving Libyan experts of the possibility of learning the advanced techniques required to follow the technological changes in the industrial sector of the industrialized countries ;  
There have been financial losses of some $ 890-million owing to the non-implementation of letters of credit in , for example , the importation of ready-made clothing and shoes , milk and other baby food , electric and other domestic appliances , spare parts , home and office furniture , and other essential goods imported from abroad to meet the consumption needs of the local market ;  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
On instructions from my Government , and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which Israel engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place during the second half of July and in August 1996 .  
It has maintained close relations with the administrative , judicial and military authorities at local and national levels , and has reported its assessment of the human rights situation to the Government on a regular basis .  
At the Social Summit , Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rested with national Governments , with the support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society , including private citizens .  
The International Council on Social Welfare , made up of a wide range of local , national and international organizations with special interests on issues related to social welfare and social development , adopted Summit follow-up as its top priority and held regional follow-up seminars for non-governmental organizations in Africa , Asia Pacific , Latin America and Europe .  
The United Nations is the main international organization requested by Governments to undertake tasks such as facilitating dialogue between warring parties , preventing renewal of internal armed conflict , strengthening infrastructure , improving local security and facilitating electoral processes .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country " .  It further indicates that " national mechanisms should be established or improved , as appropriate , to coordinate actions at all relevant government levels that have an impact on human settlements and to assess this impact prior to governmental actions " .  
The 124 national reports received by the Habitat II secretariat confirm that national planning processes generally adhered to this pattern , including representatives of national ministries , public and parastatal organizations , local authorities , the scientific and academic community , professional organizations , non-governmental and community-based organizations and the private sector .  
Because the United Nations system plays a predominantly supporting and facilitating role in shelter and settlements development , the substantive content of the follow-up by the United Nations system to Habitat II will be guided by national and local priorities for assistance , as outlined in the national reports and as further developed by the national mechanisms recommended in the Habitat Agenda .  
At the same time , the possibilities of financial support from non-traditional sources of funding , which have been opened up by the new partnerships established by the Habitat secretariat with , among others , the organized private sector , private foundations and municipal and local authorities , will be actively pursued by the Centre . D . Involvement of local authorities and civil society ,  
As reported at the consultation of the whole , on 18 September 1996 , at approximately 0200 hours local time , a 350-ton , 106-foot military submarine was found about 100 feet offshore , grounded in shallow water near the coastal city of Kangnung , one of the major ports on the eastern coast of the Republic of Korea .  
The competent authorities shall secure , on fair conditions and upon the request of the Registrar or on his behalf , the public services needed by the Tribunal such as , but not limited to , postal , telephone and telegraphic services , electricity , water , gas , sewage , collection of waste , fire protection , local transportation and cleaning of public streets .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  NULLFinally , UNIFIL continued to make every effort to ensure security and protection of its staff :  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 8 of document A / 50 / 363 / Add . 4 that , as proposed by the Secretary-General in paragraph 35 of his report to the Security Council ( S / 1996 / 416 ) , some of the existing UNMIH contingents remained in Haiti and that the revised cost estimates for the liquidation provides for the repatriation of 538 military personnel and contingent-owned equipment and for 8 international staff and 28 local staff for the closing of the base camp in Cap Ha \ x { 9ba0 } ien .  
Child sex clients have been identified as coming primarily from the following groups : paedophiles , preferential child sex abusers or regular situational customers , local prostitute users , tourists , travelling businessmen , migrant foreign workers , military personnel , public workers in isolated places and others .  
The relationship between the military and prostitution has been illustrated by cases of soldiers paying for the sexual services of orphaned , abandoned or displaced girls , who are often held in brothels under conditions of virtual slavery and forced to sexually service off-duty local soldiers .  
The revised cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 amounted to $ 31,902,000 gross and reflected a 39 per cent decrease in gross terms in comparison with the original cost estimates , taking into account that it provided for the reduced strength of 230 military observers and 9 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 167 personnel ( 102 international and 65 local ) and 2 observers from the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) .  
The revised cost estimates for the maintenance of the Observer Mission for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 represented a 47 per cent reduction in the previous estimate , due to the reduced staffing level , comprising 34 military observers , 43 international staff and 47 local staff , and the non-implementation of disarmament and demobilization programme .  
Organizations of civil society are often flexible , responsive , representative and open to wide participation ; many function at grass-roots level and provide vital opportunities for two-way communication with local communities .  
At independence , social security coverage extended only to established civil servants and established staff of administrative public institutions , local public authorities , staff of some public enterprises and some categories of employee in the structuralized private sector ( family allowances scheme , contractual retirement plan ) .  
Many delegations , while supporting in general the proposals for contributions by host governments towards local office costs ( GLOC ) , requested additional information regarding the financial impact of the proposals , in particular the financial impact of applying the revised programme thresholds for providing international staff to some net contributor countries ( NCCs ) , and the impact of the three-year waiver period following graduation .  
The Plan of Action has five objectives : the assessment of needs and formulation of strategies ; building and strengthening human rights education programmes at the international , regional , national and local levels ; developing and coordinating the development of human rights education materials ; strengthening the role of the mass media ; and promoting the global dissemination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights .  
The Plan focuses on stimulating and supporting national and local activities and initiatives and is built upon the idea of a partnership between Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations , professional associations , individuals and wide sectors of civil society .  
They should also be charged with raising funds ; channelling international and regional inputs , information and support to the local and grass-roots levels in their respective countries and coordinating with regional and international bodies involved in implementing the objectives of the Decade ; and reporting to the High Commissioner on needs , proposals and progress made towards the realization of the goals of the Decade .  
The training packages will incorporate the methodological approach mentioned in paragraph 75 of the Plan of Action , and address the following professional groups : prison officers ; primary and secondary schoolteachers ; legal professionals ( judges and lawyers ) ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; media ; and human rights monitors .  
With the active and permanent participation of the people through Guatemalan organizations , political forces and social sectors , this renewal of institutions must embrace all levels , from local authorities to the functioning of State bodies , so that all those who are entrusted with public authority fulfil their commitment to serve social justice , political participation , and the security and full development of the individual ,  
In that connection , based on the updated deployment table contained in annex V , the inclusion of 8 additional international staff and 25 local staff for six months , the application of the Zagreb salary scales for local staff as at 1 July 1996 and the inclusion under common staff costs of provision for contributions to the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund for local staff , the net reduction to civilian staff costs is only $ 642,000 .  
A colloquium organized by the Department in Warsaw in May 1996 on metropolitan and municipal governance focused on strategic planning and administrative change at the local level , including capacity-building , to support government 's new role as a facilitator of market-led economies .  
His delegation welcomed the fact that 155 out of 193 countries had already prepared national programmes of action , either in final or draft form ; the national programmes of action should be based on regional and local realities , such as historical and cultural factors and differing levels of development and capacity , in order to enhance the possibilities of achieving the targeted goals . 
The proposal was made by the Commission in its report on its forty-seventh session in 1995 , 1 / in which the Commission notes that the topic could be considered as part of its long-term programme of work and could , inter alia , cover the content and scope of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies , the rule of nationality of claims as applied to both natural and juristic persons , problems of stateless persons and dual nationals , and the effect of dispute settlement clauses on domestic remedies and on the exercise of diplomatic protection .  
Those included activities using the education for development approach in the areas of advocacy and training ; research studies by the International Child Development Centre in Florence , Italy ; workshops that addressed issues of religious , ethnic and cultural discrimination ; and dissemination of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the public in numerous local languages .  
Are convinced that sustainable development and the utilization of solar energy would be enhanced by local and national capacity-building , policy reform and technology-sharing among nations , with an emphasis on coherent efforts towards technology acquisition and development in the developing countries . 
In addition , the authorities have repeatedly stated their commitment to equality and non-discrimination , and it was apparent in the discussions of the Representative with government officials at both the central and local level that they were making efforts to ensure that the law was being applied to persons of all ethnic groups in an equal manner .  
While the authorities have made efforts to ensure that cases of illegally occupied houses are solved , and many of the cases have been dealt with fairly and justly , there still remains a significant amount of unresolved cases where the local authorities have been unable to prevent de facto ethnic discrimination , owing to intimidation , limited capacity of the judiciary , pressure exercised on judges , and in some cases because decisions of eviction have not been enforced by the local police .  
However , some of the remaining internally displaced persons informed the Representative that they received almost daily visits from local officials , telling them that they were no longer entitled to live in public buildings and threatening them with eviction .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , the High Commissioner for Human Rights / Centre for Human Rights has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
In addition , given the natural cycles of drought and floods in the region , weaknesses of rural and urban infrastructure , shortage of food stocks and seeds , generalized poverty , and vulnerability of the majority of the economic agents , the country will inevitably continue to face future emergency situations , at the local level or nationwide , arising from natural calamities .  
Key components of administrative modernization and local government reform programmes are : the reorganization of civil service personnel administration and the delegation of authority for human resources management to the provincial governments ; the revision of civil service pay , career and incentive structures to enable the Government to recruit and retain qualified staff ; the design and implementation of an integrated public administration training system ;  
During the 1996 CG meeting donors ' interventions were characterized by three " leitmotifs " or central themes : need for greater government accountability ( as opposed to mere statements of good intentions ) and improved governance , most importantly to combat corruption ; need for more rapid economic growth to reduce poverty , through boosting supply response ; and need for deepening the democratization process , through in particular multi-party local elections .  
Those constraints included the numerous changes in its mandate , as well as other uncertainties in its operating environment , delays in budgetary authorization , cumbersome and inflexible procurement practices and procedures , a lack of experienced United Nations staff , the frequent rotation of personnel , the difficulty of integrating military and civilian components , and the intractability of some local authorities with respect to their obligations under the various status-of-forces agreements .  
His delegation supported the continuing decentralization of functions which , in particular , increased managerial responsibility at the local level , and agreed that delegated management authority must be accompanied by delegated financial authority , subject , however , to the overall authority of the Office of Human Resources Management . 
Concerned about the dramatic humanitarian situation in eastern Zaire and encouraged by this statement by the Rwandan authorities , the High Commissioner is transmitting a message through the local media , reassuring the refugees that , while UNHCR would try to do everything possible to assist them where they are , the Office would be ready to help them back in Rwanda and had for that purpose increased its reception and assistance capacities inside Rwanda .  
On 7 October , as part of regular consultations , the Transitional Administrator met with President Slobodan Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , who expressed full support for UNTAES , undertook to meet with local hardline Serb leaders to urge them to cooperate with UNTAES and stated his wish to see an extension of the mandate for an additional year .  
The specialized agencies also played an active role in the countries in transition : by supporting national efforts to improve management systems in public organizations ; by giving advice on the legislative and regulatory framework necessary for establishing a market economy ; by encouraging decentralization through support to local communities ; by consolidating the democratization process ; by supporting human resource programmes , social programmes and the creation of small and medium-size businesses ; by fostering integration between neighbouring countries , and by generating capital flows .  
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .  
With respect to article 4 of the Convention , and in the light of the current difficult economic situation , the Committee emphasizes the importance of the allocation of resources to the maximum extent possible for the implementation of economic , social and cultural rights of the child at both central and local levels , in accordance with the principles of the Convention , in particular those relating to non-discrimination and the best interests of the child ( arts . 2 and 3 ) .  
The Committee is also concerned at the insufficient measures adopted to ensure effective coordination between different governmental departments competent in the areas covered by the Convention , as well as between central and local authorities .  
According to Indonesia , the proposed axis lines are the result of years of careful study of various factors , such as : the need of international transportation and aviation in transiting Indonesian waters ; the hydrographic and natural marine conditions in and near the relevant axis lines ; the intensity of coastal and inter-island navigation and overflight ; the intensity of fishing activities , particularly of local artisanal fishermen ; the existence of oil and gas exploration and exploitation ;  
When repatriation proved impossible , local or regional integration was the most desirable solution , in particular when strong ethnic and cultural ties existed between refugees and their host country .  
Despite the negative effect of the financial situation of the United Nations , as pointed out by the Assistant Secretary-General for Public Information , great progress had been made in improving the work of the Department and innovating when implementing its programmes , thanks no doubt to its links with educational institutions , think tanks and national and local governmental institutions , as well as international media organizations .  
Success or failure could depend on providing adequate information to the local population , so as to obtain their support and understanding , and to the world , since international public opinion often determined whether or not an operation received the necessary level of political and material resources .  
But it should be noted that , while innovation and competitiveness are activities of enterprises , success in innovation depends on a wide range of external factors , including the domestic institutional and social environments , national macroeconomic policies , incentive structures , the availability of skills , the local supply base , and the level of investment and linkages .  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;

Training camps for foreign Muslim extremists , originally intended for the organization of violent actions outside the Sudan , were now being used , owing to the weakening of the State and to international pressure , for domestic repression alien to local Islamic traditions .  
The attacks are alleged to result from the central Government 's official policy imposing " its truth regarding Islam on an erroneous local version of Islam " and therefore to have religious legitimacy , as demonstrated by , inter alia , the fatwa of April 1992 ( see para .  122 ) .  
Sudan Airways carries thousands of elderly patients suffering from intractable diseases such as cancer , liver failure , heart disease and arterial diseases on a weekly basis to London , Cairo , Amman and Jedda on travel tickets that are discounted by 50 per cent and are paid for in local currency .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Planning to meet requirements and the design and erection of decent and socially acceptable lodgings represents an extremely complex and expensive task inasmuch as , to cope with the problem of refugees arriving in unpredictable numbers , with major peaks , account has to be taken of economic possibilities and of the limited land areas and premises available , while also avoiding conflicts with the population and among the refugees themselves and taking into consideration local political interests .  
The departmental coordination unit to combat racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , set up within each departmental council for the prevention of delinquency under the circular issued by the Prime Minister to the prefects on 1 March 1993 , meets at least once a year to monitor problems of racism , initiate warning procedures , if necessary , collect information on local criminal policy , promote the amicable settlement of disputes and , in the light of particular local characteristics , propose measures to strengthen social cohesiveness . 
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations which , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions , as well as over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;

The limited organizational capacity of many local transport providers - particularly undersized freight forwarders , who with proper assistance might develop into efficient multimodal transport operators - is leaving many countries too dependent on foreign transport providers . 
The experts recognized that forests including wooded lands , simultaneously provide a wide range of economic , social , environmental and cultural benefits at the local , national , regional and global levels , and that maintaining all types of the world 's forests in a healthy state is in the collective interest of the present and future generations .  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those which occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali local and regional counterparts and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
Urges all States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue the further implementation of its resolution 47 / 160 so as to assist the Somali people to embark on the rehabilitation of basic social and economic services , as well as institution-building aimed at the restoration of civil administration at the local level in all those parts of the country where peace , security and stability prevail and responsible Somali leadership exists ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 ;  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
During the Habitat II process there was renewed political commitment to the implementation of new or revised national shelter policies based on the enabling approach , as there is growing recognition that better policies not only improve housing conditions but also increase the impact of the housing sector on local and national economies .  
The cost estimates contained in annex III to document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 covered the pre-liquidation period from 1 January to 30 June 1996 and provided for the repatriation travel of 309 military observers and 7,463 contingent personnel , as well as for the maintenance of an average monthly strength of 1,237 contingent personnel , 293 international civilian staff , 458 local staff , 725 international contractual personnel and 23 United Nations Volunteers .  
IFAD was already supporting countries in the early stages of implementing the Convention through the formulation of investment projects at the local level , including projects that attempted to provide an enabling environment in which farmers could help themselves , including the development of rural financial systems , demand-driven technology development , and decentralized institutions for community action .  
Appeals to Governments , in accordance with national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in the relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals in their communities , as well as reports of States Parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments ;

During the final year of the UNDP five-year cycle ( 1992-1996 ) of ongoing programmes the general objectives have been to deliver community-driven rehabilitation support , to establish a platform from which key programmes could be jointly funded by donors through the demonstration of the efficiency of a community development concept and to provide logistical support for coordinated United Nations system efforts , both at the regional and local levels .  
In addition to the 62 locations provided for in the previous submission , UNMIBH will establish a subregional headquarters in Mostar in view of the new role of the International Police Task Force of monitoring the newly formed joint local police force of East and West Mostar , two transport workshops , located in Mostar and Tuzla , a transmission station , a car park and four station team sites located in remote areas considered to be politically sensitive ( Zivinice , Bosanska Krupa , Bosanski Petrovak and Novi Grad ) .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 of 25 July 1996 ;  
Recommends that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes , in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action on the local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
[ Encouraged ] [ ( iii ) Encouraging ] Governments with the support of donors and international organizations to assist [ financially and otherwise ] existing networks promoting the sharing of TFRK [ as well as on mutually agreed terms of technology and profits from biotechnology products derived from these resources ] among concerned groups and institutions in collaboration with involved forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities ;  
The Panel , while considering the merits of the application of bottom-up approaches along with top-down approaches , involving all major groups concerned with the issues , emphasized the need for national action programmes to draw more extensively on local and traditional knowledge and agro-sylvopastoral systems , in accordance with guiding principles as outlined in programme element I . 3 . 
The Panel recognized that there is a need to promote new and innovative forms of finance and [ combine ] [ complement ] [ facilitate ] all forms of finance , at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels and to combine them with existing ones , as well as to ensure the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
Strengthening national research and training institutions at the national and international levels , and improving knowledge sharing and extension mechanisms [ is a ] are critical [ prerequisites ] with respect to increasing absorptive capacity for technology transfer and ensuring adequate capability to adapt these technologies to local conditions .  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
Requested that a matrix be prepared matching the available forest valuation methods and data set required for the evaluation of goods and services , in particular those goods and services that are not traded in the market place , at the local , national , regional and international levels ; ( c ) Encouraged [ Governments ] [ countries ] , international agencies and relevant institutions to promote research to further develop forest valuation methodologies in particular those related to degradation and deforestation and criteria and indicators .  
National level criteria and indicators should be formulated through a transparent process involving all [ relevant ] [ interested ] parties , including forest owners , [ native forest dwellers and NGOs ] [ forest dwellers , indigenous people and local communities , as well as major groups , where applicable ] .  
The Plan focuses on stimulating and supporting national and local activities and initiatives and is built upon the idea of a partnership between Governments , international organizations , non-governmental organizations , professional associations , individuals and large segments of civil society .  
National focal points will be encouraged , in the interest of building local and community-based capacities for human rights education , to include all local and community-based organizations in the national roster described in component four above , and to direct their efforts and resources , including support received from international sources , to enabling such local and community-based organizations to deliver effective human rights education to their constituencies .  
With the support of national focal points and national resource and training centres , local and community-based organizations should be prepared to deliver popular human rights education , through vocational and adult education , literacy training , local non-governmental organizations , family outreach and religious education .  
Educational materials developed at the international and regional levels should benefit from the review and input of national focal points and national resource and training centres and should be made available to national and local programmes for translation , cultural adaptation , testing and revision , with the financial and technical assistance of international and regional programmes .  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to fully , and in good faith , cooperate in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;  
Underlines the responsibility of the parties to fully , and in good faith , cooperate in the prompt formation and functioning of all the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding free and fair democratic local elections in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ;  
Calls upon all the parties to cooperate fully , and in good faith , in the prompt formation and functioning of all of the new common institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in establishing the necessary conditions for holding democratic , free and fair local elections at the municipal level in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Peace Agreement ,  
As regards the sources which reported alleged cases of arbitrary detention to the Working Group , it may be noted that of the 205 individual cases submitted by the Working Group to Governments during the period under consideration , 10 were based on information communicated by members of the families or relatives of the detained persons , 91 on information communicated by local or regional non _ governmental organizations , and 104 on information provided by international non _ governmental organizations enjoying consultative status with the Economic and Social Council .  
These actors include international and regional intergovernmental organizations ; individual States ; parliamentarians ; non-governmental organizations from the local to the global levels ; and private actors such as legal professionals , the media , academics , private institutions and civic associations , including ethnic , cultural and religious groups .  
At the same time , new channels of political expression and activity for individual citizens are developing outside governmental structures but inside the public sphere once considered the virtually exclusive province of government ; the proliferation of non-governmental organizations from the local to the global and the expansion of activity through international political associations , or " political internationals " , both make clear the deficiencies of existing governmental structures in the face of global change .  
Moreover , " international relations " - not relations among nations but relations among sovereign States - are increasingly shaped not only by the States themselves but also by an expanding array of non-State actors on the " international " scene , ranging all the way from individual persons to civic associations , non-governmental organizations , local authorities , private multinational business , academia , the media , parliamentarians and regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  
The pivotal role of regional organizations in democratizing development should be enhanced by opening channels to the regional level for the views of those at the local level , and by reducing bureaucratic obstacles to the flow or volume of assistance ; the United Nations regional economic and social commissions are well placed to contribute to such an effort .  
While today 's major challenges are undeniably global in character , it is at the local level where their impact is felt most directly , which is why local authorities , such as mayors and metropolitan officials , have become notably more active on global issues and , in some cases , collectively organized across countries on matters of common concern .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
While democratization must take place at all levels of human society - local , national , regional and global - the special power of democratization lies in its logic , which flows from the individual human person , the one irreducible entity in world affairs and the logical source of all human rights .  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management ; the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impacts of industrial development , fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened ; the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated ; while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
Yugoslavia has privatized some 90 per cent of the public housing stock and the issues now being addressed include maintenance of the existing housing stock , legalization of housing developments which are not in accordance with the approved plans , engaging local authorities in solving the housing problems of vulnerable groups , review of standards and norms and improving the database on housing .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
The guidelines also elaborate various environmental measures in relation to UNHCR activities , including : consideration of the carrying capacity of the local environment and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas in site selection and camp planning ; promotion of energy-saving stoves , energy-saving cooking methods ; economic and educational programmes designed to reduce firewood collection ; and controlled firewood harvesting .  
The view was expressed that paragraph ( 1 ) was inadequate to achieve the purpose for which it had been formulated , namely , to limit the possibility of opening local proceedings after recognition of a foreign main proceeding , since under paragraph ( 1 ) the mere presence of assets in a State would be sufficient for the opening of local proceedings .  
Having considered the different views expressed , the Commission agreed that paragraph ( 1 ) should be redrafted to provide that , upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding , the effects of a local proceeding in the enacting State should be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of that State and , to the extent necessary to implement coordination and cooperation under article 21 , to other assets of the debtor that , under the laws of that State , should be administered in such a proceeding .  
It was said that , if such standing was to be conferred on the foreign representative , it should extend only to actions that were available to the local insolvency administrator in the context of an insolvency proceeding opened in the enacting State ; care should be taken to avoid creating an impression that the foreign representative was equated with individual creditors , who under many legal systems had a right to initiate actions to avoid or otherwise render ineffective legal acts detrimental to creditors .  
Recognizing that the success of the current phase of the Initiative requires continued global coordination as well as the translation of international momentum into action at the regional , national and local levels , and that to achieve these aims the leadership and focus of the Initiative must devolve to the regional level ,  
Linked to the creation of economic and commercial activities adapted to the various areas concerned , microeconomic and microfinance projects supported by the Agency and often carried out with the assistance of local bodies like Environmental Development Action in the Third World ( ENDA ) have had beneficial , rapid and lasting results . 
Efforts to experiment with introducing new forms of democratic process to provide people with a choice of their elected representatives at the municipal or local level in certain countries deserve our notice and appreciation , if we are sincere about recognizing different historical traditions in the evolution of democratic political practice .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
The United Arab Emirates pins great hopes on international development assistance in support of plans for the establishment of national Palestinian institutions and for developing the local technical capacities of the Palestinian people in order to enable it to implement its economic and social development plans with a view to its proper integration into international trade .  
We have stressed on numerous occasions , including from this rostrum , that the global confrontation between two systems has given way to equally dangerous local and intra-State conflicts that carry within them the potential for enormous destruction , thereby posing the same global challenge to international security .  
It will be composed of 29 members , of whom 14 will be drawn from the Government 10 of them ministers and 15 from the business , labour and academic spheres ; local authorities ; non-governmental organizations from the economic , social and environmental spheres ; congressional representatives ; and three independent members .  
In the past five years , in line with this policy , Colombia has set up a regulatory and institutional framework , ranging from the establishment of the Ministry for the Environment to the creation of an environmental network enabling the authorities and the community to take part in the national and local decision-making process relating to the environment .  
The revitalized regional integration initiative of Kenya , the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda , now called the East African Cooperation , provided expanded markets for local manufacturing output among member countries .  Also , the signing of a new trade protocol among the member countries of the Southern African Development Community has paved the way for expanded markets and increased trade among the Community 's member States , although regional manufacturing is increasingly dominated by South Africa .  
The press information officers , as well as many local staff members in the area of operation , were exposed to actual or potential emergency situations and the need to assist and rehabilitate them in dealing with the after-effects of traumatic and stressful security-related experiences , in particular the incident in Qana village on 18 April , should not be overlooked .  
UNHCR notes that involvement of local rather than international non-governmental organizations is likely to provide a closer link with the private sector at the country level and with institutions of civil society , such as voluntary agencies , human rights groups , cultural and academic associations , churches and other religious bodies , and refugee community groups .  
The Ethnic Groups Act contains detailed regulations concerning the use of minority languages in official communications with federal , provincial and local authorities , including administrative authorities and courts , and they may also be used in appellate proceedings in superior courts .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
At the local level , the non-governmental organizations working with UNRWA range from support groups for individual hospitals or centres for the disabled to societies for the physically or mentally handicapped , covering a particular town or area , locally based law centres , women 's associations , universities , medical associations and camp or village committees .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
One essential lesson learned in the HIV / AIDS epidemic is that universally recognized human rights standards should guide policy-makers in formulating the direction and content of HIV-related policy and form an integral part of all aspects of national and local responses to HIV / AIDS .  
In spite of their transitory nature , those fluctuations may , owing to their echo-effect , cause significant longer-term changes in the age structure of populations at the local , national or even regional levels , such as an unusual increase or decrease in the number of older persons ( for instance , due to surges of refugees in sub-Saharan Africa ) , or an increase in the numbers of older widows ( due to increased male mortality among the older working-age groups in several European countries in transition from centrally planned economies ) .  
Bridging the data gap will require a strategy of more widespread participation in data collection and assessment , bringing together Governments , scientists , non-governmental organizations , the private sector ( including industry ) , local authorities , and even the general public in coherent efforts to document key issues and trends as a basis for management decisions at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
The global and regional exchange of new knowledge and expertise derived from local best practices , as well as new networks among major groups active in human settlements development will need to be supported .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
The main objective of chapter 26 is to establish full partnerships between Governments , international organizations and indigenous people . 14 Proposals to achieve the main objective include establishing processes that empower indigenous people ; strengthening the active participation of indigenous people in the formulation of national policies related to resource management ; and involving indigenous people at the national and local levels in programmes related to sustainable development .  
If local action is the basis of sustainable development , future decisions on political and economic resource allocation at the national level will need to give priority to supporting local authorities .  
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
While the number of personnel requiring rations is lower than in the prior period , the increase is attributable to the higher cost of bottled water ( $ 0.57 ) than in the previous period ( $ 0.50 ) and the additional requirement for bottled water for the team sites for cooking purposes , consumption by visiting flight crews and its use for generators to prevent potential damage to the equipment by the high salt and mineral content of local water . ( e ) Daily allowance .  
The Assembly also appealed to Governments to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups ( prison officers ; primary and secondary school teachers ; judges and lawyers ; national and local non-governmental organizations ; journalists ; human rights monitors ) undertaken by the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Human rights violations have been reported , in addition to sporadic and discretionary enforcement of environmental regulations : reportedly , unlined toxic waste pits allow pollution to seep into drinking water supplies , thus threatening the right to health of surrounding communities , and calls for compensation from the oil companies are often met with claims of sabotage or payment of compensation to the Government of which the local villagers see little . 
The company is also held responsible for environmental damage ranging from devastating a protected forest , to polluting a river , to damaging bridges and roads that local people use to transport their products to market . 
Also with regard to the United States , the Special Rapporteur wishes to express her particular appreciation of the comprehensive training module developed since 1982 by the Office for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention , which is responsible for carrying out law enforcement training programmes on juvenile delinquency .

While welcoming the existence of government bodies competent to deal with the welfare of children at the national level , the Committee expresses its concern at the insufficient coordination between these bodies as well as between national and local bodies in developing a comprehensive approach to the implementation of the Convention .  
While viewing with interest the extensive delegation to non-governmental organizations of delivery of certain support services to children and their families , the Committee considers that the ultimate responsibility for the quality of such Government _ supported services rests with the State party - be it at the central or local level - and that delegated programmes need careful monitoring and evaluation .  
The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
The exercise will involve mapping poverty at district and subdistrict levels through an in-depth participatory poverty assessment survey nationwide ; the preparation of national guidelines for community involvement in development activities ; training and institutional strengthening for intersectoral coordination and articulation between central and local governments ; and revamping of the country 's poverty monitoring system for use in decentralized policy and programme evaluation on a continuous basis .  
There is little question that their social and economic potential is enormous , but so too are the risks that those without the capabilities to design , produce and use the new products and service applications may be disadvantaged or excluded from participating actively in their local communities and in the global information society .  
The future is contingent on global economic developments as well as on local and national social , cultural , political and economic initiatives .

Ways and means to secure the effective protection of indigenous rights and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of TFRK , which many countries consider should incorporate appropriate payment to indigenous people and relevant local communities based on their intellectual property rights , should be identified in the context of international and national legal systems , which may include recognition of customary law and indigenous legal systems .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .

Their experience provided valuable input for the design of future peacekeeping missions , pointing to the need to accord a greater role to the civilian component and to ensure increased cooperation with local and national civic movements .  
The real innovations of the Conference will be the direct involvement of the governmental ministers most concerned in this global process for the first time , relating the discussions at the Conference to the implementation of the Programme of Action at the national , regional and local community levels in each State Member of the United Nations .  
Also convinced that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievements and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
The request is made bearing in mind that , following the recent nationwide local elections , new local authorities have been elected and established in the last remaining occupied territory of Croatia , and that the reintegration of that territory has been largely completed .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc . 
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,

The idea was also raised that building up a domestic institutional investor base could help provide additional local private demand for marketable securities .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
Paradoxically , access and transfer of technologies could represent a heavy burden for the developing countries if there were no adequate mechanisms to protect the intellectual property rights of farmers and indigenous people and the traditional lifestyles of local communities , and if the equitable and appropriate distribution of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources was not ensured .  
The combination of those four cardinal rules of development at the local level defined the approach of IFAD , based on precise actions to reduce rural poverty and promote a process of equitable and broad-based agricultural and rural development .  
Moreover , the concept of food security must stress such components as the production of a sufficient amount of food , a stable supply throughout the year , access to food for all , a proper and equitable distribution , and a commitment to producing the components of a balanced and healthy diet in keeping with local nutritional practices .  
It will reach out to different groups : the voluntary sector , social and health-care practitioners , professional and academic bodies , central and local government , industry and commerce , professionals , interested individuals , womens , youth and older peoples organizations , religious bodies , schools and colleges , cross-cultural and ethnic minority groups and many others .  
The Government of Germany has already expressed its intention to support the programme in addition to its extensive national effort , including setting up a commission , advisory group and focal point , preparing a postage stamp series , making recommendations on a society for all ages , holding a national parliamentary assembly of older persons in the German Bundestag and many other regional , local and communal events .  
Activities will focus on strengthening government capacity , at the central and local levels , for policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform and institutional and human resource development ; improving performance in the public sector ; and introducing efficient and accountable managerial systems , structures and information technologies in accordance with national development objectives .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national and international programmes and projects for the Year and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
Since dialogue is an interactive process , not an event , it must be structured , relevant , transparent , and representative , and it should have an effective influence on both policy formulation and implementation ; effective dialogue requires independent and responsible partners ; and effective dialogue must occur at all appropriate levels : federal , regional , local , sectoral , etc .  3 .  Recommendations to Governments :  
In addition to the services provided at the primary level , UNRWA aims , in principle , at providing essential in-patient medical services to the refugee population at its own facilities , at local contracted hospitals or through partial reimbursement of costs incurred by refugees for treatment at government or private hospitals .  
The Assembly appealed to Governments , in accordance with their national conditions , to accord priority to the dissemination in their relevant national and local languages of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and other human rights instruments , human rights materials and training manuals , as well as reports of States parties under the human rights treaties , and to provide information and education in those languages on the practical ways in which national and international institutions and procedures may be utilized to ensure the effective implementation of those instruments .  
Work has continued on the six training packages to support training activities addressed to professional and other target groups , such as human rights monitors , judges and lawyers , prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , journalists , and national and local non-governmental organizations undertaken by the Office and by the national committees and training centres for human rights education .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in science and technology of developing countries , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , the income-generating potential of rural women by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
The project covers five main areas of activity : human rights education and training for the judiciary , the military , the gendarmerie , the police , prison administration personnel , other civil servants and members of local human rights non-governmental organizations ; capacity-building in the sector of civilian and military justice ; capacity support for human rights non-governmental organizations ; the popularization of human rights through formal and informal education and promotion activities ; and support for genocide victims and vulnerable groups .  
The Assembly welcomed the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments5 on the report of the Special Representative , to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections were free and fair , that members of the armed forces remained neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote was confidential and that local and international observers were welcomed .  
These included deferment of military service for Serbs in the region ; guarantees of Serb political representation at the local , regional and national levels ; and affirmation of the Government 's intention to protect Serbs ' civil and legal rights as required by Croatian law .  
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
In addition to delaying or denying entry visas , initial work permits and internal travel permits to international non-governmental organizations , the Government also attempted to introduce new uncompetitive bidding procedures for local food procurement by obliging humanitarian agencies to purchase food through government parastatals .  
In that light , agency programming through 1997 has evolved to reflect several new developments , including an increased orientation towards reconstruction projects and confidence-building measures , support for capacity-building of local authorities in the health , education and social welfare sectors , improved targeting of beneficiaries and more consolidated and integrated projects oriented towards employment / income generation .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
The secretariat convened five international expert working groups to study aspects of early-warning as they relate to geological hazards , hydrometeorlogical hazards including drought , technological hazards , the use and transfer of modern technology , and national and local capabilities pertinent to early-warning .  
Subsequently , the importance of managing wildfire hazards became the dominant policy promoted through the collaborating interests of public authorities , commercial interests and local commitments driven by a combination of balanced economic , social and ecological values .  
Within the United Nations , the further development of autonomous basic research and education capabilities at local and national levels , such as that existing within the Office for Outer Space Affairs , should be supported to facilitate adaption of advanced technological methods at the local level .  
Unless national and local capabilities for basic early warning functions are improved within individual countries , external enhancements in hazard forecasting and telecommunications will not necessarily lead to successful mitigation practices .  
These require organizational structures , information flows and decision-making protocols capable of acting effectively at both national and local levels to monitor and forecast hazards at those levels , and to generate risk scenarios that can indicate the potential impacts of an impending hazard event on specifically identified vulnerable groups and sectors .  
A regional network and national networks of institutions concerned with decentralization will be created in at least 12 countries ; an open information system in the Internet connected to a UNDP global Management Development and Governance Division programme called MAGNET will support the networks and will provide access to a wide range of actors ( local governments , NGOs and private sector organizations ) .  
The first , entitled Masses in Flight : The Global Crisis of Internal Displacement , a provides a global and regional overview of the problem of internal displacement , examines the legal framework for addressing it , details intergovernmental efforts at both the international and regional levels , and non-governmental efforts and offers strategies for improving the response at the global , regional , subregional , national and local levels during the various stages of displacement , covering prevention , protection and assistance in actual situations and the promotion of durable solutions .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
For instance , the Tribunal 's activities involve field investigative work which frequently is fraught with personal risks to the investigative teams and their confidential sources ; custody , care and local as well as international transport of detainees who must be treated as high security risks at all times while at the same time respecting their basic human rights as detainees in a prison facility ; likewise for the witnesses , whose cooperation is essential to the successful prosecution of cases before the Tribunal .  
The return and sustainability of investments in physical capital appeared to be higher when done together with those in human and social capital to counteract rapid technological change and inappropriate socio-economic organization at local level .  
The projects evaluated were selected through a weighted combination of such criteria as innovative design for formulation of public policies , relevance of project strategies for programme areas and sub-offices , emerging priorities ( e.g . , child labour , AIDS ) , potential for intersectoral integration , a child rights framework , national and local impact and replicability and sustainability of results .  
The Mission 's institutional memory , its knowledge of local mores and practices and its field experience , as evidenced by its regular reports and in-depth analyses of the judicial , prison and police institutions , are comparative advantages which have made it a useful technical resource for Haitian authorities and institutions , donors and other sectors of the international community .  
Welcomes the efforts of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to contribute to the creation of an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , and broad-based programmes of human rights education , and strengthening of local non-governmental organizations through programmes of advisory services and technical cooperation ;  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and over-stretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
However , with the continuing evaluation of the long-term infrastructure needs of the Organization , in particular , as its relates to the overall strategy of upgrading the physical information technology infrastructure , resources were required for upgrading and consolidating existing underpowered local area network ( LAN ) servers , which do not at present provide the full functionality necessary ; replacement of obsolete public information capital equipment namely , existing television production equipment ; non-fixed furniture for the recently completed new conference facilities at Addis Ababa ; and so on .  
However , many difficulties and sensitive issues had been identified , arising mostly from the wide range and variability of conditions around the world , involving such matters as costs and local laws and regulations ( relating to labour , trade and funding ) , standards , patent rights and intellectual property , local environmental conditions , sociocultural aspects and transient political situations .  
An average of 96 groundsmen and cleaners were employed under special service agreements to clean a maximum of 88 military locations at a monthly payment equivalent to the lowest grade provided for in the established local salary scales ( $ 915 per month ) .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 , 1994 and , more recently , in October and November 1997 , and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue on the United Nations agenda , and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building of developing countries in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions ;  
That conditionality must be perceived in a positive light : those who cooperate in good faith in the implementation of the Agreement , whether at the central , local or municipal level , can be assured of our support .  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
The regulation on certain issues of State information policy of January 1996 , mentioned above , in addition to specifications regarding registration , placed the regional and district press under the direct control of the local political administration , with local executive committees being empowered to approve editors-in _ chief who themselves become members of the committees .

Earth observation of coastal regions were still in a pre-operational stage , key constraints being the lack of continuously operational Ocean Colour Sensors , lack of appropriate algorithms with local and timely calibration , low frequency of measurements , difficult access to data , unfriendly integration scheme with other data sources and poor information dissemination .  
Those included : exposures from natural sources of radiation ; exposures from man-made sources of radiation ; medical radiation exposures ; occupational radiation exposures ; dose assessment methodologies ; epidemiological evaluation of radiation-induced cancer ; deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair and mutagenesis ; hereditary effects of radiation ; combined effects of radiation and other agents ; models , mechanisms and uncertainties at low doses ; and local exposures and effects of the Chernobyl accident .  
Requests the Executive Director to continue the activities of the Disaster Management Programme , within the approved work programme of the next biennium , in collaboration and coordination with Member States , concerned partners and relevant United Nations organizations , as a contribution of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda at the local , national , regional and global levels , and to conduct periodic evaluations of those activities as a contribution to programme development ;

Considering that parliamentarians can contribute substantially to sustainable development by promoting legislative changes , improving public policy and strengthening institutions for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda2 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements13 at the local , national , regional and international levels ,  
A programme of technical assistance to municipalities is being implemented , with emphasis on improving local urban planning and management , the strengthening of municipal finances , and supporting the establishment of local institutional and legal frameworks .  
Emphasis is being given to improving the location of housing , services and employment in order to reduce transportation needs ; strengthening sanitary measures to reduce the environmental impact of industrial development ; fostering the use of local technologies and materials in construction ; planning and managing incremental housing programmes which minimize consumption of materials and energy ; halting the deterioration of existing housing stock ; and initiating its gradual rehabilitation .  
The decision-making capacity of local authorities and administrators will be strengthened and the existing capacity for local production of alternative materials will be enlarged and consolidated , while scientific and technical development and technological innovation will be strengthened by applying the best international and local practices .  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
We are not opposed to the moderate liberalization of markets regulated by international trade in order to prevent negative effects on sensitive sectors of local economies , but we are opposed to those who preach freedom of trade for some and then systematically avoid it for themselves as they see fit .  
In the twentieth century brutal local and global conflicts , the development and use of the cruellest weapons , the attempted extermination of entire peoples and a seemingly endless cold war gave credibility to the nightmare visions of that earlier generation .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
While it is important to act with determination and caution , on the one hand , it is , on the other , vital to know how to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can support emerging models , consolidating the global and intersectoral dimension of youth policies in close coordination with national , regional and local authorities while not ignoring the various social actors , including young people .  
The people and Government of Jamaica have long recognized that small businesses , which incorporate small-scale enterprises , micro-enterprises and cooperatives , have the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and social and economic development .  
It focuses on strengthening the institutional capacities of the Government at both central and local levels , policy management and poverty monitoring , promoting human resources development through providing better access to health and education opportunities , alleviating rural poverty , good governance and developing and strengthening the basic social safety net .  
We hope that the international community of States , non-governmental organizations , civil society , religious groups and local bodies will , together , work vigorously to promote education and awareness so that peace and tolerance may prevail throughout the world , together with a diversity of opinions and ideas and respect for basic human rights , including the right to physical and moral integrity .  
Among them we have found those attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing ; an enhanced role and responsibility for civil society ; the promotion of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through education ; facilitating informal and non-formal education in a broader range of social institutions , including families , local communities and the mass media ; recognition of equal rights and opportunities for women and men ; and attachment to the principles of tolerance , pluralism and participation .  
The use of conventional arms , often random and always indiscriminate , takes the sad credit for the death and suffering of thousands of innocent victims of local and regional conflicts .  
Countries in which rural poverty and large urban rural disparities are driving rapid urbanization should build rural infrastructure , decentralize social services and decision-making to rural local authorities , encourage rural enterprises through expansion of rural credit and technical assistance , and promote agricultural productivity .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
In addition to taking preventive action , the High Commissioner is seeking to take action regarding durable solutions , such as attempting to create an environment viable for return in post-conflict societies through initiatives such as the rehabilitation of the justice system , the creation of national institutions capable of defending human rights , broad-based programmes of human rights education , as well as the strengthening of local non-governmental organizations .  
After reviewing the testimony and documentation we are convinced that the evidence supports a conclusion that police violence and corruption on the local , state and federal levels , particularly within communities of colour and poor communities , are at the foundation of a gross and consistent pattern of human rights violations in the United States .  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
In the context of the Programme of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and in cooperation with relevant experts and organizations , HCHR / CHR has envisaged the preparation and publication of six new training manuals - for prison officers , primary and secondary school teachers , legal professionals , national and local non-governmental organizations , mass media and for monitoring - and three handbooks on human rights and conflict resolution , human rights and parliament , and human rights and constitutions .  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
Governments as enabling partners should create and strengthen effective partnerships with women , youth , the elderly , persons with disabilities , vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , indigenous people and communities , local authorities , the private sector and non-governmental organizations in each country .  
Modelled , to the extent feasible , after the global guidelines for national plans of action , national or provincial guidelines for local plans should be particularly attentive to , and inclusive of , the strategic objectives of partnership , enablement , participation , capacity-building and networking .  
Building local capacities is essential to transferring , diffusing and creating innovative technological solutions that respond best to a particular social , economic or environmental problem .  
Identified technology transfer and capacity-building projects were tailored to the actual needs of the local beneficiaries in the developing countries concerned , and helped coordinate follow-up activities at the national level .  
Consultation and information exchange , including through the use of interactive electronic networks , among existing NCPCs and with other parts of the local or national EST support structure ( for example , information systems and sources related to ESTs , technical advisory and consultation services , marketing support and legal advice services , and institutions of research and development ) , are important .  
Public-private partnerships are being implemented that try to link the advantages of private sector companies - access to finance and technology , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial experiences and engineering expertise , the capacity for producing technological innovations - with the social responsibility , environmental awareness-raising , scientific research and job generation functions of local or national Governments .  
By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
He saw this as an opportunity to examine : links between tariff reductions resulting from WTO agreements and preferences granted through the GSP and other preferential agreements ; how reduction in agricultural subsidies by major exporters had resulted in competition for local and regional producers ; and effects of the agreements on services , intellectual property rights , sanitary measures and technical barriers to trade .  
To achieve the goal of higher growth , Governments in developing countries should strive to ensure a certain level of political and social stability , to implement policies that encourage high savings , and to provide strong and stable incentives to both local and foreign investors . 
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
While maintaining her call for continued economic assistance to the countries in her mandate for their reconstruction , the Special Rapporteur believes that local authorities must be kept aware that such assistance ( to be distinguished from emergency humanitarian aid ) depends expressly on their demonstrated respect for the principles of international human rights .  
Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti , which is included in the list of least developed countries , are constrained by the extremes of the local climate , in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes , as well as of the demobilization programme , requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country ,  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali counterparts at the local level and non-governmental organizations , to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas of the country ,  
The Security Council welcomes the letter of 13 January 1997 ( S / 1997 / 27 , annex ) from the Government of Croatia on the completion of the peaceful reintegration of the region under the Transitional Administration , which guarantees the local Serb community representation and a voice at various levels of local , regional and national government , provides for a limited deferment of military service , and affirms the intention of the Government of Croatia to provide the local Serb population with the protection of their legal and civil rights under Croatian law .

The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .  
The assessment team meets with interested parties , both governmental and non-governmental , in close cooperation with the United Nations Resident Coordinator , United Nations agencies and programmes , as well as local donors , and compiles detailed information on current policies , legislation , and human and financial capacities in key areas .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local level to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , as well as in institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national , and international programmes and projects for the Year , and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as the international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
It is therefore clear that if there is to be genuine improvement in the disturbing situation in the former Sectors , efforts by both international and local organizations to promote confidence and reconciliation will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future .  1 International observers had estimated the total number of killings which had taken place in the former Sectors in circumstances unrelated to the military actions of August 1995 to be at least 120 ( see S / 1995 / 1051 ) .  
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
The Advisory Committee notes that at the time of preparation of the cost estimates for the period from 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996 , the change in the status of locally employed civilians was not anticipated and budgetary provision for the 318 locally employed civilians was made based on contractual arrangements with the United Kingdom , while actual expenditures incurred were in accordance with UNFICYP local staff salary scales and common staff costs .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Calls upon relevant cantonal governments and local authorities to take the necessary steps to end beatings , unlawful evictions and other forms of harassment , particularly in multi-ethnic areas such as Mostar and Stolac , complying fully with the demands of the Security Council contained in the statement of its President of 19 March 1997 , and to prosecute to the full extent of the law before an independent and impartial tribunal those identified in the report of the International Police Task Force concerning the incidents in Mostar on 10 February 1997 ;  
Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aiming at working directly with Somali communities , whenever possible , in the absence of a recognized national government , and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations , in partnership with Somali elders , other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level , as well as non-governmental organizations , on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches , given the varying conditions in different areas ,  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
The major tasks of UNTAES were to assist in the demilitarization of the region ; to facilitate , together with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , the voluntary and safe return of refugees and displaced persons ; to reintegrate civil administration and public services ; to establish a temporary police force ; to cooperate with the International Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ; to organize elections ; to monitor respect for the highest standards of human rights ; and to promote an atmosphere of confidence among all local residents .  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
As the period of transitional administration envisaged in the Basic Agreement draws to an end , consensus has developed between the Government of Croatia , local Serb leaders and the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on two key points : firstly , that UNTAES has successfully achieved the basic objectives for which it was established and has completed those tasks which were within its power ; and secondly , although much has been achieved by the parties , full implementation of Croatian commitments remains incomplete . 
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Renews its recommendation that all Governments formulate or strengthen integrated poverty eradication strategies and policies and implement national poverty eradication plans or programmes in a participatory manner , to address the structural causes of poverty , encompassing action at local , national , subregional , regional and international levels , and stresses that those plans or programmes should establish , within each national context , strategies and affordable time-bound goals and targets for the substantial reduction of overall poverty and the eradication of absolute poverty ;  
The sponsors and executive entities of , and the research teams involved in , the above-mentioned surveys agreed that there was a need for more coordination and complementarity in applying the experiences and the results of the surveys , in order to enhance the understanding of crime and criminal justice processes at the international as well as at the national and local levels .  
However , their situation at the regional , national and local levels has worsened as they confront increased discrimination regarding their economic , social , civil and cultural rights .  
The stated goals of the Centre are " to assist Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities by expanding access to adequate shelter , infrastructure and services for all . . . and to strengthen the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources and to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity " .  
In fact , the team did not come across any system to assess organizational performance in Habitat 's two basic goals , namely , that of assisting Governments in policy and strategy formulation to improve the living conditions of people in their communities and that of strengthening the capacity of national Governments and local authorities to mobilize public and private resources to improve urban environmental conditions and productivity .  
Through these novel modalities , the advantages of the private sector - dynamism , access to finance , knowledge of technologies , managerial efficiency , entrepreneurial spirit - are combined with the social responsibility , network of contacts , environmental awareness , local knowledge , and job generation concerns of the public sector . 
Typically , the EMPRETEC business support centres established in each country are active coalitions of public institutions , private business associations , national and foreign companies , and multilateral organizations , led by National Executive Committees comprising high-level public officials , entrepreneurs ' representatives and prominent business leaders from local and multinational companies operating in the country .  
The twelfth Meeting of Experts on Public Administration and Finance ( see A / 50 / 525-E / 1995 / 122 ) recommended that the United Nations Programme help governments define the role and scope of the public , mixed and private sectors and to suggest options in the modalities of interaction in accordance with the practical realities in each country , especially at the local and municipal levels , by means of specific technical assistance , dissemination and exchange of country experience and research on the conditions for successful replication .  
The Guidelines also elaborate various environmental measures in relation to UNHCR activities , which include ; consideration of the carrying capacity of the local environment and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas in site selection and camp planning ; promotion of energy-saving stoves , energy saving cooking methods ; economic and educational programmes designed to reduce fuelwood collection ; and controlled fuelwood harvesting .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
A design workshop for review of the substantive issues and content of modules being developed and testing them ; four inter-agency training-of-trainers workshops ; two workshops for resident and humanitarian coordinators at the regional and interregional levels ; and four field-level workshops in selected countries for personnel of the United Nations system , donor community , non-governmental organizations and local partners .  
Other objectives include the provision of timely and authoritative information by the Spokesman for the Secretary-General to media representatives , the provision of timely and adaptable information materials through the United Nations information centres to meet regional and local needs , the establishment of an international broadcasting system and monitoring of international trends and events as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the Organization and the Secretary-General by major media networks .  
In that capacity , it strengthens contact with key public opinion leaders , including government officials , parliamentarians , local media , educational and academic institutions and NGOs in order to promote an informed understanding of the role of the Organization in peacekeeping , peacemaking and post-conflict peace-building and to stimulate public support for the Organization 's activities in the political , economic , social and humanitarian fields . 
Gross and massive violations of human rights can be committed by local State bodies and officials , too , but the danger of such violations increases immeasurably when they are committed by , for example , a parliament passing racist laws , or a ministerial cabinet conducting a repressive policy .  
Eight workshops on enhancing policy analysis capacity in African public services ; developing standards and indicators for better civil service performance ; strengthening the leadership and the managerial and technical capacities of local government ; formulation of policies and measures to foster small enterprises and micro-enterprises ; and investment promotion centres and private sector development in Africa ; ( i ) Advisory services .  
In light of the Committees view that further efforts are required to ensure that the Convention is used as a political tool and a framework for action on behalf of children , the Committee recommends that future national and local programmes of action on children incorporate policies , programmes , aims and goals reflecting the principles and provisions of the Convention .  
The Committee also suggests that a multidisciplinary monitoring and coordinating system be established to assess the progress achieved and difficulties encountered in the realization of the rights recognized by the Convention at the national and local levels , paying particular attention to the adverse effects of economic policies on children .  
With regard to the follow-up to Habitat II , ACC , at its first regular session for 1997 , decided that the arrangements should focus on supporting country-level action and coordination and should involve the development of guidelines to orient the resident coordinator system in establishing country-level thematic groups and strengthening implementation and monitoring at the national and local level .  
Hence , international cooperation efforts should be intensified and strengthened towards the developing countries ' endogenous capacity-building in science and technology , including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad and to adapt them to suit local conditions . 
Governments should enhance , at the national and local levels , rural women 's income-generating potential by facilitating their equal access to and control over productive resources , land , credit , capital , property rights , development programmes and cooperative structures .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
In any case , the Inspectors ' suggestion that such teams should be assisted by the local United Nations Resident Coordinators would be difficult to reconcile either with the Member States ' view that developmental and humanitarian activities in the field should not be mixed with political activities or with UNDP 's need to work in close cooperation with Governments .  
To enhance concerted action of the global community - which is an essential requirement to ensure effectiveness of preventive efforts at the international , regional , national and local levels - the United Nations should act as a centre and catalyst of joint efforts , to cultivate an effective division of labour between all the actors involved ( specialized agencies , regional organizations , national institutions , NGOs , as well as parliamentary groups , academic institutions , etc . ) taking into account their knowledge , experiences , potentiality and comparative advantages .  
The SRCF will be used for : ( i ) financing assistance to governments and regional / subregional bodies in the national , subregional and regional action programming ; ( ii ) financing assistance for the preparation of local area development programmes ( LADPs ) that respond to National Action Programmes , bearing in mind also the dual track approach for LADPs and NAPs that some countries might envisage ; and ( iii ) catalytic financing for National Desertification Funds , designed within the context of National Action Programmes . 22 .  Finance for civil society .  
In addition , recognizing the imperative of a conducive policy environment for participation of resource users in conservation and sustainable management of natural resources , the Fund has launched a comprehensive programme of studies to examine pertinent policy and institutional issues at the national and local levels .  
Governments should focus on being enabling partners and facilitators by creating and strengthening effective partnerships with a broad spectrum of national and grass-roots groups including local authorities , the private sector , non-governmental organizations , women 's and youth groups and the scientific and academic communities .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
Strategies at the regional , national and local levels for reducing the potential risk due to ambient and indoor air pollution should be developed , bearing in mind their serious impacts on human health , including strategies to make parents , families and communities aware of the adverse environmental health impacts of tobacco .  
What is required then is to reduce the environmental impact of their continued development , and to reduce local health hazards and environmental pollution through enhanced international cooperation , notably in the provision of concessional finance for capacity development and transfer of the relevant technology , and through appropriate national action .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
Access should be provided to effective judicial and administrative channels for affected individuals and groups to ensure that all authorities , both national and local , and other civil organizations remain accountable for their actions in accordance with their obligations , at the appropriate levels for the country concerned , taking into account the judicial and administrative systems of the country concerned .  
Indeed , while we applaud the recognition granted to local government in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 , the two pages in that Chapter hardly reflect the immense financial , infrastructure , administrative and governmental contribution of local Governments to the green and brown agendas or to the agendas of the North and South .  
Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
Regarding the national plan , I must stress that it was developed through a participatory approach involving international donors , public administrations , academic and scientific research institutions , the private sector , local communities , non-governmental organizations and professional organizations .  
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
In its resolution 1992 / 50 on the fraudulent or unlawful enrichment of top State officials , the Commission on Human Rights pointed clearly to the responsibility of the North in connection with the commission of that crime in the countries of the South and thus raised the question , still unclear in international law , of the restitution to despoiled peoples , for reinvestment in local economic , social and cultural development , of the funds which their leaders have extorted from them , usually with the complicity of foreign banks .  
As to the renewal of the dialogue on strengthening international economic cooperation for development through partnership , he said that the partnership should be based on clearly defined relations and must ensure cooperation at the bilateral and multilateral levels between rich and poor countries , with a view to finding solutions at the local , regional and international levels .  
Convinced also that a year designed to enhance the recognition , facilitation , networking , and promotion of volunteer service , with particular emphasis upon activity at the local level , could make a significant contribution to generating increased awareness of the achievement and the further potential of volunteer service , to encouraging offers of service from a greatly expanded number of individuals , and to channelling resources to enable the even greater effectiveness of such service ,  
When authorities at the national , regional or local levels faced a sufficiently high number of individuals whose primary language was a minority language , States had come to accept that they must provide a level of service appropriate to the relative number of individuals involved .  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
On 6 April , the first round of elections for one third of the Senate and two seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the election of thousands of members of local assemblies were held without major incident , although some political activists had engaged in heavy-handed , intimidating tactics reminiscent of earlier regimes .  
In addition to the comments generally applicable to the holding of awareness days , it is noteworthy that most concerned countries are pursuing efforts to sensitize a wide audience to the issue of combating desertification , not only at the national level but at provincial and local levels as well .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
Requests Governments , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations and the specialized agencies , actively to support local , national and international initiatives , including the development of human rights indicators , aimed at assessing and improving the housing and living conditions of women throughout the world , in full consultation with and with the full participation of women themselves , their representatives and community _ based non _ governmental organizations and other relevant groups ;  
Recommends that Governments cooperate with trade unions and employers ' organizations at the national level to address the problem of bonded labour and that trade unions and employers ' organizations at the local , national and international levels utilize the existing structures of the International Labour Organization dealing with violations of the relevant conventions concerning forced labour , and encourages concerned non _ governmental organizations to strengthen their activities for disseminating information and advising trade unions in this regard ;  
In order to implement the recommendations made at the Fourth World Conference on Women , Lebanon had established a national committee on women 's matters which was responsible for coordination with the official authorities , both central and local , and with non-governmental organizations of the League of Arab States at the level of the Arab countries , and with intergovernmental bodies , non-governmental organizations , the United Nations and its specialized agencies at the international level .  
Recognizing the importance of prevention in order to achieve demand reduction , his Government had developed a strategy which accorded a major role to the family and also involved teachers , voluntary organizations , youth , media , parents , local councils and the leisure industry .  It had adopted a social model rather than a medical model in the treatment and rehabilitation field and was giving priority to community services .  
Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
The centres would develop train the trainer programmes to train peace promoters in the region concerned and to monitor and support their peace promotion work on a long-term basis , producing ultimately a diverse and flexible network of peace promoters around the world , connected by modern communication technology , for the exchange of information and experience in building a culture of peace at the local and regional level .  
Experts identified five main areas of potential policy incoherence : between macroeconomic policy and microeconomic policy ; between public and private sector bodies involved in SME support services ; between the federal and local levels ; between implementation and design ; and between internal and external policies .  
While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
As the Council underlined , the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration is the full cooperation of the Government of Croatia , which bears the ultimate responsibility for convincing the local population that their reintegration is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible .  
It must be mentioned , however , that even when Trade Points have not been prevented from operating in the private sector , they sometimes had to face an unfriendly environment : since one of the most immediate practical impacts of Trade Points is to diminish the importance of intermediaries by bringing local enterprises a step closer to their markets and their customers and suppliers , Trade Points sometimes had to face direct or indirect opposition from such intermediaries ; this opposition should not be expected to diminish in the future .  
The major issues addressed included providing an enabling environment for conversion at both national and local levels ; the role of public and private sectors ; conversion of military bases and defence industries to export processing zones ; tourism development in former military bases and defence complexes ; civilian manufacturing , prospects for small and medium-sized enterprise development ; and continuity of social infrastructure services .  
Information centres are an essential partner in this effort , whether establishing strong working relationships with the local media and responding to their inquiries ; cooperating with civil society and other local partners to promote major United Nations themes ; disseminating the Department 's products , such as booklets , brochures or United Nations radio and video programmes ; maintaining reference libraries ; translating the Department 's material into local languages ; servicing visits of the Secretary-General and other senior officials to their host countries ; or maintaining liaison with Governments .  
Equally important to both recipients and donors are the knowledge derived by UNDCP from its functions in the field of international treaty implementation and related advisory services , the capacity to adapt to local circumstances a wide range and variety of methodologies and best practices developed under pilot projects throughout the world , and its experience in working with counterparts in defining , planning and implementing operational activities at national , subregional , regional and global levels .  
To tackle illicit cultivation in Afghanistan effectively and to sever trafficking routes flowing from that country will require a major - and sustained - investment by the international community coupled with the commitment of local authorities to enforce a ban on opium poppy cultivation as a condition of participation in alternative development activities .  
Further indicators include a net increase in the following : the number of coca-farming families assisted by national agencies and committed to the elimination of their coca crops ; geographic coverage and number of hectares devoted to alternative development ; the use of central , regional and local entities for alternative development planning and implementation ; private investment in alternative development activities ; the donor base and the value of alternative development activities coordinated by agencies .  
Assessments are required continuously , to guide rational and effective decision-making for environmental policy formulation , implementation and evaluation at local , national , regional and global levels .  
One approach is to reduce traditional backward and forward linkages to the local economy to a minimum by not promoting economic growth and its attendant service and administrative infrastructure at the site of production .  
The recent increase in mineral investment in developing economies provides an opportunity to develop creative partnerships at the local level to integrate mine development into a wider regional strategy for improving economic and social conditions .  
The development of cost-effective , meaningful and useful methods for the regular assessment , monitoring and review of the environmental performance of industry at the local , national , regional and global levels is urgently required .  
With the encroachment of agriculture on natural or quasi-natural ecosystems , plant and animal genetic resources are being lost , modern cultivars are replacing local ones and intensive livestock production systems are developing .  
An increasing role in peacekeeping operations was being played by civilian police , who assisted local police forces in restoring public order , upholding the rule of law and promoting civil reconciliation .  
Action at the global level and action at the regional , national and local levels should be consistent with each other and based on common norms .  
The purpose of the Social Incentive Fund is to provide a comprehensive and concerted approach at the local level to the numerous problems involved in improvement of the urban living environment .  
The challenge now is to combine this complex policy and organizational mix at the local , national and international levels into a critical mass that can lead to significant changes in human behaviour .  
The Commission noted that , as the world has become more industrialized , there have been increasing environmental pressures such as harmful emissions and waste , which have had global , regional or local impacts .  
Particularly in the social field , advisory services and group training proved to be the most effective means to reach local governments and grass-roots people , including the urban and rural poor , women , children , youth , the aged and the handicapped .  
The Government has launched a major programme of reforming the public sector aimed at improving the capacity for efficient service delivery , devolving administrative power from the centre and increasing democratic participation in local government .  
There is , however , a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
By supporting democratically accountable local governments , UNCDF has demonstrated that civil society can be empowered and the local private sector stimulated to participate in poverty reduction .  
That meeting intended to forge firm partnerships on five key issues : global economic commerce ; biotrade , for the benefit of indigenous and local communities ; commercial diplomacy ; risk management of commodities , and microcredit .  
One was to reject everything that was foreign , on the reasoning that each countrys situation was unique and that external influences tended to be irrelevant at best or to undermine local uniqueness and cultural identity at worst .  
Other environmental health risks such as unsafe uses of lead , tobacco and ambient and indoor air pollution need to be adequately addressed in local , national and regional preventive strategies with a view to reducing their potential effects .  
Accountants from developing countries have additional difficulties in that their local qualifications are not recognized abroad , and transnational corporations and international agencies located in their countries depend on foreign accountants .  
As training materials needed to reflect a rapidly changing technology and specific local conditions , they had to be both flexible and based on simple principles with wide and durable applicability .  
At the regional and local levels , IFAD is helping to build a cadre of microfinance technical experts , strengthen training centres and promote sustained linkages to commercial capital , while seeking to ensure a favourable regulatory environment .  
Another indigenous representative from Oceania recognized that , despite difficulties , some progress had been made in indigenous health conditions and that traditional cultural , social and spiritual needs were addressed in close cooperation with local groups .  
Since FDI is mainly a real investment in firms , its mobility is limited by such factors as physical assets , networks of suppliers , the local infrastructure , human capital and the institutional environment ; FDI stocks are generally not footloose .  
There is a need to transform these clusters into local / regional growth poles reaping the benefits of both physical proximity and networking , thus raising their competitiveness at both the individual firm and systemic level .  
The majority of the reports indicate social / cultural benefits , including active involvement of local communities , increased public awareness , and maintenance of natural heritage and historical sites , as well as cleaner air .  
The operating model utilized depends mainly upon the technological sophistication of the local exporter and trade services communities which in turn depends on the general development stage , geographical size and logistical constraints of the local market .  
With the sporadic outbreak of local conflicts , the excessive accumulations of small arms and light weapons have not only had direct human costs , but also brought immeasurable social and economic dislocation .  
To eliminate the need to import expensive ready-made prosthetic components from abroad , ICRC has introduced new materials and developed special moulds to facilitate low-cost production at the local or regional level .  
It should be designed to meet critical urgent needs , as well as the long-term requirements essential for the development of a sustainable national / local capacity , when applicable .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
As chemical and organic pollutants become more pervasive , the adverse impact on marine environments is increasing , and long-term accumulation in marine ecosystems is threatening biodiversity and the local fishing industry upon which many small island developing States are highly dependent .  
Other training and reference materials in the pipeline are : a training manual for primary and secondary school teachers ; a training manual for national and local NGOs ; a handbook for parliamentarians ; a trainers guide for military peacekeepers , a training manual for the treatment of victims of domestic violence for the police ; and a handbook on human rights and constitutions .  
These would involve transferring genocide cases falling within categories 3 and 4 , and possibly also 2 , 12 / to this local communal level of traditional justice , where locally elected and respected members of the community would preside over cases involving other members charged with these offences .  
The cost of three additional staff under general temporary assistance ( equivalent to 1-D-2 , 1 General Service and 1 local ) were absorbed within approved resources , as reported to the Advisory Committee in a letter from the Controller dated 11 February 1998 .  
We know that organizations in civil society require participatory space enabling them to be involved in the development process and to become real actors , alongside Government organizations , in management and decision-making , especially at the local level , and in designing and following up national development policies . 
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
Expresses its appreciation and strong support for those African Governments and local populations that , in spite of the general deterioration of socio-economic and environmental conditions and overstretched national resources , continue to accept the additional burden imposed upon them by increasing numbers of refugees and displaced persons , in compliance with the relevant principles of asylum ;  
Noting with concern that , during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made , especially at the local level , the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved , and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever ,  
Progress in achieving sustainable forest management will depend on effective integration and coordination of local , national , regional and international actions related to these topics in addition to main economic instruments , such as direct economic incentives ( subsidies and charges ) , tax policies , resource rent capture and regulation of land tenure .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to a variety of global environmental systems , it is important to consider the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy demands for goods and other services .  
As increasing local , national , regional and international attention is focused on the contribution of forests to global environmental systems , the report also considers the effects of policies on the ability of forests to satisfy these demands for goods and services .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
However , considering the value of these forests to local populations , it will be difficult to adequately identify quality changes , especially change in species composition and biological diversity , which is mostly induced by the common practice of selective cutting of highly valuable trees .  
I would emphasize here , without wanting to be too critical , an occasional lack of understanding in the implementation of adopted policies ; a pernicious role played by local personnel ; supporters of those in power being recruited by the international organizations ; a perceived lack of sensitivity on the part of those who were in charge of certain political and diplomatic aspects ; and perhaps too frequent personnel turnover .  
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
Governments and relevant international and regional organizations have been encouraged to conduct case studies , and communicate these to the Executive Secretary of the Convention on the impacts of intellectual property rights on the achievement of the objectives of the Convention , including relationships between intellectual property rights and the traditional knowledge of indigenous and local communities ( decisions III / 14 and III / 17 of the Conference of Parties ) .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
They may also take into account the application of appropriate sui generis legislation ( for which a number of models now exist ) , as well as using provisions under existing national and subnational laws governing such matters as land tenure , cultural heritage and local government , which frequently contain provisions for regional agreements and permit regimes ( governing access to indigenous / local community lands , research and collection of components of biological diversity etc . ) . 
The cruel irony is that the very victims of development are the ones who are being forced to tighten their belt and eat less in order to pay for the extravagant mistakes of powerful local elites and their external supporters .  25 .  The heavy borrowing of the 1970s alone did not precipitate the debt crisis .  
The periodic humanitarian assistance in the form of food , clothing , footwear and medicines given by international and local charitable organizations , small enterprises and farms also plays an important role in aiding the needy , the elderly , the disabled , residential institutions and orphans .  
They were decided without consultation with the provincial authorities , local populations , or international and non-governmental organizations engaged in development work in the province , and without any adequate social and environmental impact assessment studies .  
The activities undertaken to mark the anniversary by Governments , international and regional organizations and , most notably , by civil society at all levels - local , national , regional and international _ have also provided clear evidence of a reinvigorated commitment to human rights as the common principles which should unite the international community as a new century begins . 
Putting into practice the new development strategy required two complementary approaches : a comprehensive approach to obtaining the necessary financing , not only through official development assistance but also through foreign direct investment , along with strengthening of the socio-economic infrastructure in both material and institutional terms ; and a more individual approach , taking into account local conditions and development initiatives in the developing countries .  
In concluding his presentation to the Committee , Mr . Otunnu pointed out that his programme of work for 1999 involved a series of initiatives at the country , regional and international levels which focused on developing public advocacy , strengthening international standards and local values , establishing concrete initiatives in the midst of ongoing conflict , and mobilizing concerted responses to post-conflict needs .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Mention should be made of the social problems existing in EPZs : local landlords take advantage of the accommodation shortage to charge enormous rents for sub _ standard accommodation ; transport services and social infrastructure ( especially child _ care facilities ) are often non-existent ; friction between the EPZ workers and local residents is common and real integration of workers in local communities is difficult to achieve , in particular because of the high turnover in many Zones .  
It should be noted that , in this dispute , in which a number of workers were dismissed , workers who refused to stop supporting the ad hoc committee that had been set up or to renounce their intention to join the local union were prevented from entering the plantations , giving rise to declarations of illegal strikes and unwarranted dismissals , the verification of which revealed procedural irregularities .  
As to clandestine structures at the local level , the adverse effects of the continuing impunity of these groups can be gauged , in respect of so-called social cleansing operations , by an incident which occurred on the road to Bethel , La Libertad , in El Petn .  
The Special Rapporteur is encouraged to note that the Government sought outside , non-governmental expertise to : ( i ) develop a coherent policy and strategy for domestic violence ; ( ii ) propose a set of legal measures ; and ( iii ) implement a framework for training local staff .  
Not only had India taken institutional , legal and educational measures to strengthen the role of women at the political level , but it had also taken affirmative action to ensure that women filled one third of the seats in all elected local , village and municipal bodies , thereby providing them with the opportunity to exert influence in the formal structures of economic , political and social decision-making .  
Small businesses had the potential to create jobs , utilize local raw materials and scientific and technological expertise and involve large numbers of people in national decision-making and economic and social development .  
A strong and amicable relationship between the developed and developing countries was essential for the eradication of poverty ; international efforts in that regard must be adapted to national and local circumstances and based on an assessment of the needs of the poor .  
For other atrocities , documentary evidence that directly implicates individuals , whether at the senior governmental level or the regional or local level , is currently not available and may never be found given the uneven nature of record-keeping in Democratic Kampuchea and the apparent loss of many documents since 1979 .  
In some developing countries , a combination of weak or nonexistent policies on the one hand and the efforts of private firms on the other has already stimulated a shift from food production for subsistence for local communities to large-scale production of few crops and varieties for national and international markets , resulting in a loss of diversity .  
Daily and weekly dissemination on tape , via satellite and / or shortwave broadcasting , telephone feeds and as sound files on the Internet to participating radio organizations in all regions of the world for local , national , regional and international broadcasting ( News and Media Division ) ; ii .  
This resulted primarily from the upward revision of local staff salaries by 61.8 per cent , effective 1 March 1997 , and the delayed liquidation of obligations no longer required , which could not be identified and cancelled in time before the closing of the accounts .  
Additional requirements of $ 1,991,900 are recorded under civilian personnel costs , due to various developments such as the unbudgeted increase in local staff salaries , noted in paragraph 27 above ; as well as the delayed termination / separation of individual local contractors employed under special service agreements ( SSA ) , and of local staff hired as general temporary assistance whose contracts expired beyond 30 June 1997 .  
With the completion of the phased withdrawal of UNAVEM III formed military units , the authorized strength of MONUA from 1 March 1998 comprised 90 military observers , 955 contingent personnel , 345 civilian police observers , supported by a civilian establishment of 281 international staff , 225 local staff and 71 United Nations Volunteers .  
In this connection , MINURCA is assuring the opposition that the international electoral observers to be deployed starting next month ( see paras . 14 and 15 below ) will also pay close attention to the functioning of CEMI at the local level to ensure the impartiality of the local chairmen .  
Crucial requirements are well known and include improving the access to and quality of primary , secondary , technical and vocational education ; improving marketing arrangements for primary commodities ; land reform ; mobilization of domestic saving for infrastructure including small scale , local public works and for private investment ; and attracting foreign direct investment under conditions that ensure benefits to the receiving countries .  
Requests States to establish coordinated , participatory , transparent and accountable national policies and programmes for HIV / AIDS response and to translate national policies to district level and local action , involving in all phases of development and implementation non-governmental and community _ based organizations and people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
The induction of lightly armed international civilian security officers and additional local watchmen has further augmented the existing internal security arrangements .  
The ISP is designed to be compatible with the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Stand-by Letters of Credit ( which represents a useful and practical formulation of basic standby and independent guarantee law ) and also with local law , whether statutory or judicial , and to embody standby letter of credit practice under that law .  
At the country level , UNDP responded to growing demand from programme countries for capacity development in : governing institutions ( judiciaries , legislative bodies and electoral bodies ) ; decentralization and local governance ; public sector management and administration ; and civil society organizations .  
Tourism had the potential to make an important contribution to poverty alleviation and economic advancement , particularly through integrated plans with the inclusion of local stakeholders in planning and development and where a key objective remained the protection of the cultural and natural assets of the tourist locality .  
They are guaranteed the right to establish and use their own mass media , cultural , educational , language and religious institutions , and to establish and foster unhindered relations and maintain peaceful contacts with co-nationals outside the Yugoslav borders , as well as the right to participate at the national , regional and local levels .  
Requests States to establish coordinated , participatory , transparent and accountable national policies and programmes for HIV / AIDS response and to translate national policies to district level and local action , involving in all phases of development and implementation non-governmental and community _ based organizations and people living with HIV / AIDS ;  
The existing voluntary initiatives were identified as being complementary to national and local regulatory compliance efforts , as these initiatives are designed to be cost-effective means of surpassing existing regulatory requirements .  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
In discussing integrated coastal zone management , participants agreed that there were real biophysical limits to capacity in any particular location as well as cultural limits that should be determined at the local level by the local community .  
To undertake capacity-building work with indigenous and local communities in order to facilitate their active participation , at all levels of the tourism development process , including transparent decision-making and sharing of benefits , and to create awareness of the social , economic and environmental costs and benefits that they are bearing ;  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of means of diversion from ordinary criminal justice proceedings and mediation policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to ensure broad professional and geographical participation at the workshop from , inter alia , policy advisers , law enforcement and prosecutorial authorities , judicial officers , academics , social workers , relevant United Nations bodies , including the United Nations Development Programme , relevant non-governmental organizations , members of the private security industry , the business community , the media , local government officials and crime prevention coordinators .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of procedures to serve as alternatives to formal criminal justice proceedings and to formulate mediation and restorative justice policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation and restorative justice among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
Pursuant to resolution 1201 ( 1998 ) , by which the Security Council mandated MINURCA to support the conduct of legislative elections in the Central African Republic in November and December 1998 , operational plans developed by MINURCA called for the deployment for a period of 2.5 months of an additional 21 international and 18 local staff , 94 medium and short-term electoral observers and for the provision of related additional air , transportation and communications assets .  
The budgets provide for the continued deployment of 1,350 military contingent personnel and 24 police officers , supported by an increased civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers , with provisions for the Missions liquidation reflected in the proposed 1999 / 00 budget .  
Actions were elaborated to target , inter alia , strengthening coordination between national and local support strategies and institutions ; strengthening institutional capacities for supporting small and medium enterprises in key agro-industrial subsectors ; and improving national capacities in the sustainable management of natural resources , with emphasis on the conservation of biodiversity and exploitation of its business opportunities .  
The CNR agreed ( a ) that nominations to the posts of President , members of Parliament and local governmental bodies be made by political parties or individuals , ( b ) to retain the presidential system for the executive , while proposing ( c ) a professional ( full-time ) bicameral parliament .  
The main orientations of such a policy would include improving market transparency ; enhancing information flows to local operators , and in particular the capacity of these operators to analyse this information ; providing a sound , stable policy environment and legal and regulatory framework ; stimulating the emergence of support services ; and enabling access to modern marketing , risk management and financing instruments .  
The revised budget for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 is therefore based on the maintenance of 1,350 military contingent personnel , 24 civilian police officers supported by the increased ( from 1 March 1999 ) civilian staffing establishment of 114 international staff , 111 local staff and 13 United Nations Volunteers .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
This means that while macro policies are needed ( such as promoting open markets , streamlining import and export regimes and protecting property rights ) , measures to stimulate upgrading and the development of technological capabilities will need to be formulated and also implemented at the local and regional level .  
The members of the Council are prepared to support a credible , fair and transparent electoral process leading to early legislative and local elections .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
The role of the customary areas is to be enhanced by the revision of their current uncertain legal status and by the creation of customary institutions endowed with powers at the local and national levels .  
Finally , the substantive , constructive and formal dialogue at the international , national and local levels concerning international indigenous human rights standards may prove to be a fruitful method or mechanism for creating understanding about the values and perspectives of indigenous peoples .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
Reform of local legislation in some Territories to comply with the same standards of human rights as those existing in the United Kingdom with regard to capital punishment , judicial corporal punishment and consensual homosexual acts .  
With daily attacks on the chemical industry and electrical power plants , the NATO forces have caused numerous technological , chemical and industrial accidents throughout Yugoslavia , with wide local consequences and will all elements of transboundary environmental catastrophe .  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
Like previous regional urban forums , the Third Forum would include representatives of national and local governments , private sector businesses , civil society organizations , including NGOs , academic and training institutes , and the media .  
The discussions between high-level panellists and the audience , both of whom are composed of representatives of member States , local and regional NGOs , academics and opinion leaders , will focus on the main areas of the United Nations , including its role in the areas of peace and security , economic and social development cooperation , humanitarian relief and human rights .  
The seafaring industries , which frequently draw on the poorest strata of the population in developing countries for employment , have shown that employment in the shipping industry has a major impact on both rural and urban poor ( access to foreign currency , regular salary , economic viability for the families of seafarers and for the local community ) .  
This includes regular army and naval forces , armed civilian groups , associated paramilitary groups , air forces , national guards , border police , army reserves , military police , intelligence services , federal and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs local , special , riot and anti-terrorist police , and any other groups or individuals so designated by the international security force ( KFOR ) commander ;  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
This is one of the most rapidly progressing and developing national sectors and signifies a major extension of satellite communication coverage , providing communities with a greater range of local telephone and radio services , which have been used , for example , for communications to and from regions hit by natural disasters , with a consequent improvement in the utilization of the resources assigned to disaster management .  
Bilateral tax treaties promote orderly international tax relationships resulting in the exchange of fiscal information and procedures for mutual assistance , and facilitate the establishment of level playing fields between local businesses and those owned by foreign investors due to the operation of non-discriminatory clauses of such treaties .  
Abilities essential to the reduction of natural and similar disasters are increasingly being drawn from the public sector , professional and institutional organizations , commercial interests and local forms of community leadership . 
As was emphasized at the IDNDR international conference on early warning systems ( Potsdam , Germany , September 1998 ) , effective early warning is a process that must bring together scientific analysis and technical forecasting of a hazard , together with the political decision-making process and the availability of local community capabilities to heed the warning .  
Their primary objective should be to seek , through their presence and contacts with the local authorities , to promote respect for minimum humanitarian standards and deter massive and systematic violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the future .  
Whatever the reasoning followed , the dominant viewpoint - as reflected , in general , in the specialized literature and in State administrative decisions , as well as in the decisions of the domestic courts - asserts that treaties involving indigenous peoples are basically a domestic issue , to be construed , eventually implemented and adjudicated via existing internal mechanisms , such as the courts and federal ( and even local ) authorities .  
Forms of participation by resident non-citizens should also be developed , including local voting rights after a certain period of residence and inclusion of elected non-citizen observers in municipal , regional and national legislative and decision-making assemblies ;  
Governments at local , regional and national levels should recognize the role of multiple identities in contributing to open communities and in establishing useful distinctions between public institutional structures and cultural identities ;  
The orthodox view of exhaustion of local remedies was the procedural view , namely , that the wrong might have occurred but no international action could be taken by way of a diplomatic claim or human rights complaint prior to the exhaustion of local remedies .  
The problem was that , according to the normal understanding , where an obligation was breached and the exhaustion rule applied , the applicable international law was the law applicable at the time the harm was done and not at the time the local remedies were exhausted ; indeed it was difficult to specify that time because of the different ways in which local remedies could be exhausted .  
If the primary injured subject changed from , e.g . , the individual to a State of which he is a national , this would affect the application of the rule of the exhaustion of local remedies insofar as it did not apply in the case of a composite wrongful act .  
In recognition of the fact that the forthcoming legislative and local elections are the only viable way to resolve the present crisis , the transition Government , in its recently issued plan of action , announced plans to work closely with the Provisional Electoral Council to ensure free , fair and transparent elections , and to seek to revive the interest in participation of the Haitian population in the democratization process .  
The objectives of the Government in oil refining are : to increase lubrication oil production to meet overall local demand ; to improve the quality of refined products by reducing sulphur contents in gas oil and kerosene and the necessity for lead compounds in gasoline ; to improve safety standards and fire - fighting capabilities ; to improve environmental protection by enhanced treatment to effluent water and gas emissions ; and to increase operating efficiency in general .  
Each State Party shall consider implementing measures , in cooperation with non-governmental organizations and local communities , to provide for the physical , psychological and social recovery and , when requested , spiritual assistance of victims of and witnesses to crimes covered by this Protocol , in order to foster their health , self-respect and dignity , as well as their education and employment opportunities , in a manner appropriate to their age , gender and special needs .  
The main premise guiding INSTRAWs research area is that womens involvement in urban and rural , national and local politics , as well as their untiring efforts to advance womens causes through the mobilization of civil society , contributes not only to gender equality but also to expanding the boundaries of citizenship , democratization , civil society and political decision-making .  
There are reports of illegal occupation of land and property in areas left by departing Albanian and Serbian local residents , as well as indications that criminal groups may be taking control of vacant housing and property in flagrant violation of the legitimate rights of the original owners and occupants . 
It reports on the ways and means to ensure a better relative balance in the share of technical cooperation activities among the various regions , taking into account their respective needs as well as making maximum use , in the implementation of technical cooperation activities , of existing capacities of developing countries , including local and regional expertise .  
The overall strategy is based on using limited UNDP core resources to launch capacity-building programmes that are subsequently sustained through bilateral donor support , and ensuring the sustainability of capacity-building programmes by matching UNDP technical and managerial expertise with the accountability and viability of local implementation partners .  
In accordance with the international standards , " a substantial autonomy " implies that some specific powers and rights , such as the right to the use of language , education and information in one 's own tongue , protection and fostering of one 's own culture and tradition as well as local administration affairs , are transferred to the autonomous region , which takes place within the framework of a broader constitutional and legal order in a sovereign State .  
In order to prepare the country technologically for the expected information explosion of the twenty-first century , South Africa will align its regulatory framework to make use of all the technological advantages offered by wireless local loop and by fixed and mobile satellite services .  
The Decade was primarily established to promote disaster reduction as a multisectoral and interdisciplinary activity , comprising a wide variety of interrelated fields at the local , national , regional and international levels .
