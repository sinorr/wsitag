The official said that since last year the central government had requested a strengthening of macroeconomic regulation but due to the misunderstanding of some local governments and firms the first quarter of the year still saw an obvious surge in new projects and a comparatively large amount of fixed assets investment , resulting in a fast growth in monetary credit .  
The central bank has introduced a number of policies recently .  The comprehensive utilization of various monetary policies is identical to the aforementioned " slow braking " currently required for macroeconomic regulation .  
For the last two years , aimed at the changed international and domestic economic situation and the domestic deflation trend that has appeared , the Chinese Government has sized up the time , adjusting its policy promptly , making the key decision to expand domestic demand , and taking a series of macroeconomic regulation and control steps , the main substance of which is pursuing an active fiscal policy . 
and the major measures should conform to such requirements as strengthening macro-economic control and regulation , readjusting the structure of the economy , making sound arrangements for the state 's key constructions , taking earnest steps to improve the living standards of the people , enhancing the level of employment , providing sound social securities , and bringing about a sustainable growth . "  
Having coolly analyzed the economic situation at the time , carried out thorough investigation and study , and extensively listened to the suggestions and views of experts and scholars , the central authorities held a timely meeting , looked into and set out a policy of further strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , and readjusted the intensity and specific measures of the fiscal policy .  
main measures to be taken should meet the requirements of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , properly scheduling key state projects , truly improving the people 's livelihood , actively increasing employment , ensuring social insurance work , and ensuring sustainable development .  
and the major measures should meet the requirements for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , planning state key construction projects well , effectively improving people 's living standards , actively promoting employment , and succeeding in social security work and sustainable development .  
It is necessary to properly handle the direction and intensity of macro regulation and control , combine internal demand expansion , structural readjustment , scientific and technological progress , and opening up to the outside work , accelerate the fundamental transformation of the economic structure and economic growth modes , and strive to uplift the development of the national economy to a new stage .  
Zeng Peiyan said that generally speaking , the execution of the plan for 1999 was good , and the country basically fulfilled the main regulation and control targets of the economic and social development plan : We continued to maintain a good momentum in national economic development , and there was some improvement in the growth quality and returns ; GDP was 8.2054-trillion yuan , an increase of 7.1 percent on 1998 ;  
In the fields of comprehensive supporting reforms , they set up the system for the common development of multiple economic sectors , the system for the operations of state-owned assets , the system for macroeconomic regulation and control , the market system , the social security system , and so on .  
Structural readjustment of enterprises means to concentrate effective resources through the market on the industries that concern the state 's economic lifeline and whose scale merit is particularly evident to enable them to establish an appropriate scale of production and operation , so that they will become important industries of the national economy , the pillars of the essential areas , the leaders in economic restructuring , the representatives to international competition , and the leading forces in the state 's regulation and control of the state .  
Currently China 's foreign bond issues are regulated primarily under the pertinent State Council regulations on further strengthening the macro control over the use of international commercial loans , the State Development Planning Commission 's circular on comprehensive planned management of foreign debts , and the People 's Bank of China 's " Measures Controlling the Internal Institutions ' Issuance of Foreign Currency-based Bonds , " and so on .  There is no systematic law or regulation controlling the issuance of debt instruments overseas , and we urgently need to improve the relevant laws and regulations .  
At a high-level international symposium on the reform of China 's monetary sector held a few days ago , Wu Xiaoling stated that the main directions of China 's monetary policy reforms are : We will further improve our monetary policy system with emphasis on indirect regulation and control , and give more play to open market operations and the regulatory role of rediscount rates and bank interest rates to ensure the smooth attainment of the targets of our monetary policy .  
In accordance with such a regulation that " the Hong Kong Garrison shall inform in advance the Hong Kong SAR Government before conducting training , exercises , or other military activities as well as activities concerning the public interests in the Hong Kong SAR " , the garrison has informed in a timely fashion the SAR Government or published in advance a public notice in the SAR Government Gazette in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong law before conducting an outdoor live-fire shooting exercise .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Issuing and implementing the " armament regulation " will play a positive and important role in profoundly carrying out the strategic military principles in the new period , reinforcing the centralized leadership in the armament work , standardizing the operating mechanism in armament work and establishing and completing the legal system of armament work .  
We should base its implementation on winning modern regional wars , particularly high-tech regional wars , and closely center its implementation on preparing for future military struggles .  We should take needs as the drive , regard technology as the boost , and consider systems as the insurance .  We should strictly carry out the principles , procedures and methods stipulated in the " armament regulation , " comprehensively complete every task in armament construction , reinforce the quality of our military construction and strengthen the military through science and technology .  
The main role of the government is to create a favorable macroeconomic environment for structural readjustment by improving macroeconomic regulation and control , pressing ahead with reform , restoring market order through economic policy , providing public services , and concentrating its energies on major projects .  
Fourth , optimize the organizational structure of the enterprises , appropriately merging enterprises in the same industries through the market mechanism which maintain the good and eliminate the bad and through macroeconomic regulation , ensure full competition among enterprises , form a pattern dominated by large enterprises and suited to the coordinated development of enterprises of all sizes .  
First , macroeconomic regulation and control will be intensified and improved in a bid to maintain macroeconomic stability , push forward the strategic economic structural adjustment , and guarantee the country 's economic security through working out economic and social development plans and macroeconomic policies that primarily depend on the application of economic and legal means . 
By checking and taking inventory of the stock and figuring out the bottom line , it provides an accurate and reliable basis for helping the state to formulate a macro regulation and control policy with regard to grain production and circulation and to actively promote the readjustment of the agricultural structure and increase the peasants ' income , and we can then help to ensure the timely transfer and proper utilization of the state 's grain stockpile when needed .  
The recently published " Blue Paper on Chinese Economic Forecasting , " which was put together by several well-known economists , predicts that China 's GDP will grow about 7.8 percent this year , barring a major deterioration in the international economic environment and provided that the Chinese government continues to base macroeconomic regulation and control on an active fiscal policy , properly coordinates the various macroeconomic regulatory and control measures , and further stimulates domestic demand .  
Ding Jiye : Mainly in three aspects : First , we institute categorized budget management , that is , military expenditure is divided into two main categories , sustained expenditure and construction expenditure , according to the nature of the use of the funds ; these two categories are budgeted separately , macroeconomic regulation and control is stepped up , and different focal points to be ensured are set down ;  
Ding Jiye : This reform stresses improving the method and procedure in drawing up the budget .  The main special features are : The reform itself does not require increased input , while the regulation and control function of the military budget is markedly strengthened , the economic returns on military funds will be markedly enhanced , and funds can be concentrated on ensuring preparedness for military struggle ;  
Rectifying and regulating market economic order involves work that is pressing , burdensome , extensive , and heavily policy oriented .  All localities and departments must combine the unified plans of the State Council with the actual situation in deciding on the focus of their work ; must put forward criteria for timeliness and progress ; must undertake rectification in strict accordance with the law ; and must protect the normal production and operations of enterprises .  There must be rectification while regulating , and regulation while rectifying .  
The open market operation played an important role in putting base money into circulation in 1998 and 1999 , regulating the liquidity of commercial banks in 2000 , and guiding the interest rates for money markets .  It has become a major tool of monetary policies in the daily operation of the central bank , which indicated that the operating system of monetary policies has basically achieved the change from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
Through practicing macroeconomic regulation and control measures , with the focus on expansionist fiscal policy , in the past three years China has successfully withstood the blow of the Asian financial crisis and maintained the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
Under the banner of " self defense " , they broke through the " restricted zone " set by the constitution and relevant ordinances .  They have kept engaging in arms expansion .  They have increased their military spending year by year , ignoring long ago the regulation that Japan 's military expenditure is not allowed to exceed 1 percent of its gross national product .  
It requires a transformation from sole reliance on administrative measures as in the past , to the comprehensive use of legal , economic , and administrative measures .  It requires a transformation from government control and direct intervention under the planned economic system to guidance services and macro regulation under the market economic system .  It requires a transformation from overstaffed organizations in which there are more people than there is work to do , to streamlined organizations with highly skilled personnel .  
We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .  
If we treat only the symptoms , not the root cause , we would not only be unable to consolidate the achievements that have been made in the rectification and improvement , but also lose such achievements altogether .  When that happened , the offense of making and selling counterfeit products would rear its ugly head again and may even become worse .  Therefore , firstly , the legislative work concerning market regulation should be strengthened and perfected .  
He demanded that the broad ranks of cadres and employees working in the industrial and commercial administration sector nationwide perform their duties conscientiously , reinforce regulation and law enforcement , bravely act as defenders of the market , strive to open up a new prospect in industrial and commercial administration , and make new contributions to the establishment and maintenance of a good order of market economy and the sustained and healthy development of the national economy .  
In March this year , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to rename the State Administration for Industry and Commerce as State General Administration for Industry and Commerce , upgrading it from the vice ministerial level to the ministerial level .  The purpose was to further strengthen its authority and status as a market regulation and law enforcement department , so that the government 's institutional setup could better meet the requirements of the socialist market economic system .  
All industrial and commercial law enforcers must be faithful to their duty , be brave to take responsibility , and remain upright and incorruptible .  They should make a good job of market regulation and law enforcement by presenting a clean , honest , and lofty image ;  
and should build up and perfect a macroeconomic control and regulation system that can effectively resist the impacts of international economic fluctuations , and build up a whole set of operable and effective mechanisms for macroeconomic control and regulation that comply with international standards .  
Second , we will establish and improve a macro regulation and control system for energy development with economic and legal means playing a dominant role while being supplemented by essential administrative measures , such as building environmental protection rules and systems , reforming the price and charge collection systems , improving tax collection and interest discount policies .  
4 .  The Government should assess the feasibilities of establishing an offshore capital market .  According to international regulation , Taiwan should be prepared to establish an offshore capital market that operates independently from the domestic market .  Taiwan should attract overseas businesses , including the Taiwan businesses now operating on the Mainland , to become listed businesses or to issue securities in US dollar in this capital market .  
These successes , however , were mainly achieved because the central authorities increased market demand by adopting effective macroeconomic regulation and control policies , and at the same time compressed and knocked out surplus and backward productive capacity , thus creating a favorable market environment for enterprise development .  
In this connection , I suggest removing provincial civil aviation administrative bodies and putting into practice a model of vertical administration of the regions by the state , establishing a unified system of air regulation in civil aviation , and strengthening investment in air control systems and insofar as possible adopting the world 's most advanced air control techniques and equipment .  
Judging from these situations , the overall environment of this year 's economic work is good .  The negative factors are that currently demand for essential goods is insufficient and the employment pressure has increased and probably will be quite reduced as the international economic situation has further turned for the better and as the effect and results of the state 's macroeconomic regulation and control measures gradually come into play .  
Its major achievements include increasing domestic demands through macroeconomic regulation and control , helping state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises turn losses into profits , increasing export , implementing the strategy for developing the vast western region , and reaching accords with the United States on China 's accession to the World Trade Organization [ WTO ] .  
It is fair to say that the government 's economic management evolved from the manipulative style of the planned economic era to the guidance style of the reform era , but the its way of managing the economy must still progress to the regulation and control mode of the developed economy .  It should regulate the economy by promulgating economic policies , by means of market regulations , and by utilizing financial levers .  But this is premised first and foremost upon the banks becoming bona fide market barometers .  
This means that , in national security and fields needed for national economic development where private investment can not or is unwilling to access , the state-owned economy needs to advance , creating the essential terms for national security and national economic development , to give the state the relevant regulation and control capacity over economic development .  
Enterprise structural adjustment means acting in lines affecting the pulse of the national economy with particularly marked efficiency of scale to amass effective resources through the market , forming production and operations of scale , to turn them into pillars in key lines and fields of the national economy , leaders in economic structural adjustment , representative participants in international competition , and the key forces for state regulation and control of the economy .

The " Publication Control Regulations " and the relevant regulations on newspaper and periodical control lay down that in publishing newspapers and periodicals it is necessary to have a set business scope and a specific operational purpose ; this is the most basic regulation on running papers and periodicals .  
In accordance with the spirit of the relevant central decisions and the provisions of the relevant laws , central macroeconomic regulation and control matters such as currency issue , the fixing of standard interest rates , foreign exchange rate regulation , and readjustments of the main tax forms and rates , unified market activities regulations , and legal systems regarding foreign trade and investment by foreign companies must all be regulated in a unified way by the central authorities , and the localities are not permitted to lay down regulations on them .  
If the Chinese macroeconomic regulation and control departments ' recommendation of issuing additional treasury bonds is approved by the State Council and adopted by the National People 's Congress , it will be the third time running for the Chinese Government to issue additional treasury bonds in the second half year following the issuance of 100 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of 1998 and 60 billion yuan worth of additional treasury bonds in the second half of last year .  
It is noteworthy that China experienced economic overheating from 1992 to 1993 .  From the summer of 1993 , the central authorities intensified and improved macroeconomic regulation and control , gradually cooling down economic overheating .  GDP growth was down from 14.2 percent in 1992 to 13.5 percent in 1993 , 12.6 percent in 1994 , 10.5 percent in 1995 , and 9.6 percent in 1996 .  
Such favorable turns and changes were mainly the results of effectively promoting economic growth through the implementation by the state of a proactive fiscal policy , a moderate monetary policy , a policy on industrial restructuring , and a series of measures for macroeconomic regulation and control ;  
Judging from China 's economic development since 1993 , the central authorities have become more mature in macroeconomic regulation and control .  In addition to accumulating rich experience in controlling inflation , China has gained initial experience in vigorously checking the deflation trend .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
We should build the state finance by making it secure , balanced , and strong and should give scope to finance 's macroeconomic regulation and control role , this being an objective and necessary requirement for steadily and healthily developing both the national economy and various social undertakings .  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
Organization and personnel departments at all levels should fully perform their functions of providing macro-level regulation and operational guidance , successfully carry out the work of initiating and coordinating efforts , act in close coordination with personnel planning , fiscal , labor , and social security agencies as well as sectoral agencies in charge of science , education , culture , health , information , and publishing , so as to form a joint force and carry out concerted efforts to successfully complete this work .  
For this reason , the revised draft law has provided an additional regulation : " When tax organs discover that taxpayers have evaded tax payment obligations and have showed obvious signs of transferring and hiding the taxable commodities , goods , and other properties or the taxable income during the legal examination of tax payment situation in previous years , tax organs are authorized to take tax protective measures in accordance with the Article 35 of this law , with the approval of directors of tax bureaus ( sub-bureaus ) at or above the county level . "  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
For many years , the NPC and its standing committee have formulated a large number of laws to standardize the main body of the markets , maintain the market order , and practice macroeconomic regulation and control , thereby safeguarding the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy .  
The great development of the western region requires the combination of the government 's macroeconomic control and regulation with the functioning of the market mechanisms , and requires active exploration of new ideas , new methods , and new mechanisms for the development of the western region , which will be carried out and pushed forward in an orderly way with priority given to selected key fields . 
The meeting maintained that , like cracking down on smuggling and foreign exchange fraud , the crackdown on export rebate fraud is an important political assignment as well as an urgent economic struggle ; and that this struggle is greatly significant for tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , increasing revenues , and promoting a healthy economic development , as well as for managing the country according to the law and for consolidating and regulating the markets ' economic order and stamping out corruption in society .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
Li Lanqing said in his letter that under the leadership of the party 's central committee and the State Council , significant headway has been made in financial reforms and tremendous achievements have been scored in the financial work over the past few years , as a result of practicing the proactive financial policies and intensifying and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control in finance , which have promoted the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
The guiding ideas on the propaganda and ideological front are clear , its line of thought on work is distinct , it is bold in reform and innovation , and effective in macro regulation and control ; it has built relatively perfect regulations and systems and effective operational work mechanisms , and fostered a work force which is politically strong and professionally skilled , with strict discipline and healthy work style .  
Dai Xianglong said : It is necessary to continuously maintain an appropriate growth of money supply .  The planned targets of credit regulation and control for 2001 are as follows : The broad money ( M2 ) is projected to grow by 13 percent to 14 percent , and the narrow money ( M1 ) 15 percent to 16 percent ; net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to grow by 1.3 trillion yuan .  
When the issue of the regulation of supply comes up , people often mention tax cuts and accelerated depreciation .  These measures have positive significance for lowering enterprise costs , improving enterprise competitiveness , increasing effective supply , and promoting enterprise development .  Not to be overlooked are support for the enterprises ' technological transformation and other innovation and the readjustment of the supply structure .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
The ' outline ' points out that in order to establish and perfect financial organization systems , market systems , oversight systems , and regulation and control systems , there must be comprehensive reform of the commercial banks wholly owned by the state .  Qualified commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state can be reorganized into share-holding commercial banks in which the state controls the shares .  Other measures include the establishment of risk prevention mechanisms , improving competitiveness , and so forth .  
Economic restructuring was further deepened , phased results were attained in the state enterprise reform , the basic role played by the market mechanism in the allocation of resources was notably strengthened , the government 's economic control and regulation system was further reinforced , and a socialist market economic structure took its initial shape .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .

In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .  
" All the favourable conditions in Hong Kong which have underpinned our robust development in the past , such as our prudent financial policy , low taxation , sound financial and banking regulation , first-rate infrastructural facilities are still there and unaffected by external factors . "

In those countries which have been badly affected , it was a combination of private sector over-borrowing , inadequate bank regulation , poor risk management , governmental subsidies , and tragic policy errors at the corporate and banking levels , both national and international .  
In macro terms , this means greater transparency and disclosure , greater accountability , stronger domestic financial systems , liberal trade , open financial markets , a high quality of regulation , and independent legal processes .  
Our decision that continuous efforts in civic education and self regulation are preferable to coercion in the promotion of racial equality also took into account the public consultation held early last year which clearly indicated that legislation in this area would not enjoy a significant level of public acceptance or support . 
" The aim of the opinion survey is to assimilate public opinions on the existing regulatory system for obscene and indecent articles , areas covered include effectiveness of the system , the classification framework for printed and visual articles , general standards accepted by the public , regulation of the Internet and effectiveness of public education and publicity efforts , " a spokesman for TELA said .  
We therefore believe the correct response lies on increased awareness of the public through education to protect themselves against deceptive and fraudulent activities than subjecting an otherwise long-established , effective and efficient market under unnecessary regulation . 
In addition , we are also committed to work closely with the market regulators including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the SFC to maintain a proper and modern regulatory regime in Hong Kong , and through them with overseas regulators on the promotion of international co-operation and best international practices on regulation of financial markets .

The Government also reaffirmed the plan to consolidate the existing 12 pieces of securities-related legislation into one , with the intention to provide a more transparent and coherent regulatory framework and more effective regulation in an increasingly sophisticated and fast changing financial market .  
" The proposed framework covers different essential elements including effective financial crisis management , prudent risk management , proper corporate governance to strike a right balance between its commercial interest and the wider public interest , general regulation that ensures NewCo operates appropriately and prudently , and shareholding limit to ensure a truly diversified ownership , " the spokesman said .  
No matter what forms of international monitoring and regulation might arise out of the discussions that are currently in progress , domestic financial systems will remain the basic building blocks of the international financial system for the foreseeable future , particularly in a region as politically and economically diverse as Asia . 
Major proposals in the legislative reforms include promulgating clear regulatory objectives for the SFC , introducing new checks and balances on the SFC , enhancing its investigatory and disciplinary powers to minimise market misconduct , streamlining of licensing regime for intermediaries to facilitate more effective regulation , and promoting quality disclosure for investors to make informed decisions .  
Although the exact scope and modality of the next round of services negotiations have not yet been agreed among WTO members , we are glad to note that there is emerging support for the coverage to be comprehensive and the need to minimize the trade-distorting effects of domestic regulation and anti-competitive behaviour .  
Equally important are the possession of a stable and liquid capital market , with world-class market infrastructure , making use of the most advanced information technology and telecommunications , sophisticated but flexible regulation , strong foundations for the rule of law , high calibre personnel and professionals , and political and social stability " .

Furthermore , we must continue to move forward with free market economy with level playing field , clear , unobstrusive and transparent business regulation , a clean and effective civil service and an outward looking society .  
These include high taxation , stringent regulation and cosy corporate governance characterised by the equity of major businesses being closely held by friendly groups of long-term investors , including one 's bankers and associate companies - or Euroland 's version of the crony capitalism for which parts of Asia have been so severely rebuked .  
Hong Kong 's market mechanism is well aligned with the world system .  The regulation of financial businesses such as banking , insurance and securities is efficient .

A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "  
Let me emphasise that it is not our intention to target any single offshore gambling operation - in fact , in drafting this provision , we have considered whether the regulation of live broadcast of odds on TV and radio should be extended to all sporting events .  
However , we are mindful that in the absence of broadcast of odds on other sporting events at the moment , it may not be fully justified to extend the scope of the regulation to cover them .  We therefore proposed to confine the scope of the provision to deal with an existing problem , i.e . the live coverage of odds of unauthorised horse and dog races on TV or radio , because live broadcast of such information is obviously for the purpose of facilitating unlawful gambling activities .  
The Banking ( Amendment ) Bill 2000 seeks to strengthen the regulatory functions of the MA corresponding to the introduction of the regulatory regime by the SF Bill , to ensure that regulation of the securities business of exempt AIs is carried out in a more effective and fair manner .

Upon enactment of the subsidiary legislations , the licensing system for Chinese medicine traders will be implemented in the first half of next year , followed by the registration of proprietary Chinese medicines .

Thinking back to the dictatorial imperial system , " worshipping Heaven " was a special privilege reserved for the Son of Heaven ( the Emperor ) . in the Ching dynasty , there was still the regulation that any ordinary person caught worshipping Heaven directly would be punished with 80 strokes of the rod , so that common folk had no choice but to worship in secret .  
The concept of fetal toxicosis originated in the ancients ' misunderstanding of rashes and communicable diseases . Red lead and cinnabarre still sometimes misused in Chinese medicine today , in spite of scientific evidence , resulting in heavy metal poisoning .

In the past an insurance policy allowed for free treatment ; now it has for no apparent reason taken a leap upward in cost due to the " partial cost sharing " regulation .

After the plan for the offshore shipping center was brought before the public , the PRC government , which up until then had been constantly calling for direct cross-strait shipping to be established , based on the definition of a " domestic shipping line , " reversed its attitude 180 degrees . Since the regulation was passed over one year ago , not even one commercial ship has succeeded in crossing the strait .  
Honestly-run direct sales companies have regulations designed to prevent problems . For example , some individuals might buy up large stocks to falsely build up impressive sales records . Or people might purchase large amounts of products ( to become large brokers and skim profits off of secondary sales ) but-unable to sell them all-have to dump them back on the headquarters . One such regulation to avoid problems like these is the " 70% rule , " which requires members to sell off 70% of their current items before they can replenish their stock .  
Over a long period , as the various agencies implemented the policies decided upon by the relevant ministries of the central government , they were never in harmony , nor was there any authority to force these various units to work together for the regulation of waterways .

In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 .

These initiatives focused on increased use of alternative transportation fuels ( e.g . , natural gas ) , support for urban public transport , and improved transportation planning and regulation .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
The regulation on certain issues of State information policy of January 1996 , mentioned above , in addition to specifications regarding registration , placed the regional and district press under the direct control of the local political administration , with local executive committees being empowered to approve editors-in _ chief who themselves become members of the committees .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .

What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
L . As in the case of question 4 , although there seem to be differences of opinion as to whether or not the distinct phases require different degrees of regulation , it was apparent from the substantive comments received that if a special regime for aerospace objects were to be discussed and formulated , all aspects mentioned by the respondents could be incorporated into appropriate language for such a special regime .  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
The paper is divided into four main sections , which deal respectively with increasing opportunities in the private sector , the business-enabling environment , promotion of competition and social regulation , and a final section which briefly touches on the role of the international community with regard to the foregoing .

While it is true that many studies have been made of economic , social and cultural rights and of collective rights such as the right to development and the right to a healthy environment from the point of view of their history , legal basis , regulation or scope , there have been very few on ways of combating violations of them .

We are deeply convinced that such an approach will increase the responsibility of each littoral State for the consequences of activities in its own sector ; make possible the effective legal regulation of the use of marine resources on the basis of national legislation ; make it easier to attract foreign investment to the region , which in turn will contribute to the region 's economic growth ; and minimize the likelihood of disputes among States concerning specific deposits in the Caspian Sea .  
In natural monopolies , regulation focuses primarily on the production of the socially desirable level of services at economic prices , in particular by limiting the opportunities for the public service provider to collect monopoly rents .  
Since the crisis was a systemic problem , innovative measures at the national , regional and global levels were required to address the lack of surveillance , the regulation of short-term capital flows and the volatility of currency markets .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .

Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .

It requires a transformation from sole reliance on administrative measures as in the past , to the comprehensive use of legal , economic , and administrative measures .

We can still expect the national economic growth rate for the whole year to reach or exceed the 7 percent target that was determined early this year , provided that the global economy does not deteriorate further , weather conditions are basically normal , and the policy for macroeconomic regulation and control is implemented rather well .

In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
We should build the state finance by making it secure , balanced , and strong and should give scope to finance 's macroeconomic regulation and control role , this being an objective and necessary requirement for steadily and healthily developing both the national economy and various social undertakings .  
Since 1999 , the state has been pursuing a series of active fiscal and macroeconomic regulation and control policies to drive domestic demand and expand consumption .  For instance , it has issued an additional 60 billion yuan in treasury bonds , raised the income level of low-income urban residents , extended holidays , and taken steps to stimulate exports .  
Organization and personnel departments at all levels should fully perform their functions of providing macro-level regulation and operational guidance , successfully carry out the work of initiating and coordinating efforts , act in close coordination with personnel planning , fiscal , labor , and social security agencies as well as sectoral agencies in charge of science , education , culture , health , information , and publishing , so as to form a joint force and carry out concerted efforts to successfully complete this work .  
For this reason , the revised draft law has provided an additional regulation : " When tax organs discover that taxpayers have evaded tax payment obligations and have showed obvious signs of transferring and hiding the taxable commodities , goods , and other properties or the taxable income during the legal examination of tax payment situation in previous years , tax organs are authorized to take tax protective measures in accordance with the Article 35 of this law , with the approval of directors of tax bureaus ( sub-bureaus ) at or above the county level . "  
Zeng Peiyan said : For over two years now , we have been acting under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core to insist on pursuing an active fiscal policy and stable monetary policy , which has effectively brought into full play the role of all macroeconomic regulation and control policies .  
For many years , the NPC and its standing committee have formulated a large number of laws to standardize the main body of the markets , maintain the market order , and practice macroeconomic regulation and control , thereby safeguarding the healthy and orderly development of the socialist market economy .  
The great development of the western region requires the combination of the government 's macroeconomic control and regulation with the functioning of the market mechanisms , and requires active exploration of new ideas , new methods , and new mechanisms for the development of the western region , which will be carried out and pushed forward in an orderly way with priority given to selected key fields . 
The meeting maintained that , like cracking down on smuggling and foreign exchange fraud , the crackdown on export rebate fraud is an important political assignment as well as an urgent economic struggle ; and that this struggle is greatly significant for tightening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control , increasing revenues , and promoting a healthy economic development , as well as for managing the country according to the law and for consolidating and regulating the markets ' economic order and stamping out corruption in society .  
Uphold the guideline of expanding domestic demand , continue to practice an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy , and make comprehensive use of various means of macroeconomic regulation and control , to consolidate and develop the good momentum of economic growth .  
Li Lanqing said in his letter that under the leadership of the party 's central committee and the State Council , significant headway has been made in financial reforms and tremendous achievements have been scored in the financial work over the past few years , as a result of practicing the proactive financial policies and intensifying and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control in finance , which have promoted the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .

Dai Xianglong said : It is necessary to continuously maintain an appropriate growth of money supply .  The planned targets of credit regulation and control for 2001 are as follows : The broad money ( M2 ) is projected to grow by 13 percent to 14 percent , and the narrow money ( M1 ) 15 percent to 16 percent ; net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to grow by 1.3 trillion yuan .  
When the issue of the regulation of supply comes up , people often mention tax cuts and accelerated depreciation .  These measures have positive significance for lowering enterprise costs , improving enterprise competitiveness , increasing effective supply , and promoting enterprise development .  Not to be overlooked are support for the enterprises ' technological transformation and other innovation and the readjustment of the supply structure .  
This is because we have initially established the socialist market economy structure , and accumulated more experience in macroeconomic management and in regulation and control ; and we have overcome difficulties caused by insufficient effective domestic demand through implementing the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practicing an active fiscal policy and a stable monetary policy .  
The ' outline ' points out that in order to establish and perfect financial organization systems , market systems , oversight systems , and regulation and control systems , there must be comprehensive reform of the commercial banks wholly owned by the state .  Qualified commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state can be reorganized into share-holding commercial banks in which the state controls the shares .  Other measures include the establishment of risk prevention mechanisms , improving competitiveness , and so forth .  
Economic restructuring was further deepened , phased results were attained in the state enterprise reform , the basic role played by the market mechanism in the allocation of resources was notably strengthened , the government 's economic control and regulation system was further reinforced , and a socialist market economic structure took its initial shape .  
from investment to consumption and to other fields , a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy have been implemented flexibly , the policy of expanding domestic demand has been resolutely pursued , and measures for macroeconomic regulation and control have been highly effective .

Let me emphasise that it is not our intention to target any single offshore gambling operation - in fact , in drafting this provision , we have considered whether the regulation of live broadcast of odds on TV and radio should be extended to all sporting events .  
However , we are mindful that in the absence of broadcast of odds on other sporting events at the moment , it may not be fully justified to extend the scope of the regulation to cover them .  We therefore proposed to confine the scope of the provision to deal with an existing problem , i.e . the live coverage of odds of unauthorised horse and dog races on TV or radio , because live broadcast of such information is obviously for the purpose of facilitating unlawful gambling activities .

In order to make national market-based instruments effective in the international context , and to discourage " free riders " , a global partnership based on multilateral regulation is needed .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the services provided by forests , including those relating to biological diversity and global climate regulation , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate those values into monetary terms to encourage forest owners , forest dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities to conserve forests and manage them sustainably .  
In a second step , during the biennium 1997-1998 , it will be necessary to supplement the new version with a number of new provisions , such as detailed packing instructions for individual substances and other provisions normally found in instruments regulating the transport of dangerous goods by one given mode , so that the model regulation can be directly integrated into national or international instruments , without substantial redrafting .  
The Committee requested the secretariat to prepare the tenth revised edition of the Recommendations on the basis of its work in the biennium 1995-1996 and the texts adopted at its nineteenth session and to publish it in the form of a model regulation , annexed to a basic recommendation , in the most effective manner , without delay , in all official languages of the United Nations and not later than the end of 1997 .

International negotiations were central to bilateral and multilateral cooperation between States , to the management of international relations , the peaceful settlement of disputes and the creation of new international norms of conduct , yet the conduct of negotiations was the one type of diplomatic activity that had not been touched by regulation , codification and harmonization .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
On the other hand , it was generally assumed by the Panel members that the measures for prevention should be applied primarily to the small arms and light weapons manufactured to military specifications , because in this case the question has to be addressed on a global basis and because the issue of civilian firearms regulation is currently being taken up by the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice .  
Admittedly , the Conference on Disarmament can not be expected to produce a global treaty on arms regulation and disarmament every few years , and it is acknowledged that all major negotiations are always preceded by a pre-negotiating stage aimed at reaching an understanding among all the participants on the issues to be addressed and the basic parameters of the instrument to be negotiated . 
One of the main tasks of the conference could be to draw up , in cooperation with other interested international organizations , a United Nations strategy for the regulation of migratory flows and the prevention of mass forced population displacement at the global level .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .

However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
Large capital inflows can also result in speculative bubbles in certain economic sectors or the stock market or in an over-expansion of domestic credit if prudential regulation is inadequate or not enforced .  
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .

But a close examination of the present cases reveal that while it is true that the obsolete labour market regulation in Latin America has created labour market rigidities in the urban formal sector and incentives for employment to expand in the unregulated informal sector , the movements in employment and real wages have nevertheless closely corresponded to movements in output and labour productivity .  
L . As in the case of question 4 , although there seem to be differences of opinion as to whether or not the distinct phases require different degrees of regulation , it was apparent from the substantive comments received that if a special regime for aerospace objects were to be discussed and formulated , all aspects mentioned by the respondents could be incorporated into appropriate language for such a special regime .  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
The crises of the past year or so in Albania and Bulgaria have highlighted the issues in a dramatic fashion , but many of the constituent elements of the problems in those countries - low quality of banks ' asset portfolios , " cosy relationships " between banks , state-owned enterprises and ministries , weak or non-existent regulation , and a widespread , popular mistrust of the banking system - are present in varying degrees elsewhere in eastern Europe and in the CIS .  
The paper is divided into four main sections , which deal respectively with increasing opportunities in the private sector , the business-enabling environment , promotion of competition and social regulation , and a final section which briefly touches on the role of the international community with regard to the foregoing .

Progress in achieving sustainable forest management will depend on effective integration and coordination of local , national , regional and international actions related to these topics in addition to main economic instruments , such as direct economic incentives ( subsidies and charges ) , tax policies , resource rent capture and regulation of land tenure .  
Therefore , while contractual arrangements may be agreed to by the parties to counter the adverse effects of subsequent regulatory changes ( see paras . 60-63 ) , regulatory bodies would be well advised to avoid excessive regulation or unreasonably frequent changes in existing rules .
