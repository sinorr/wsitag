As the local and regional economic environment stabilised , Hong Kong recorded a further BoP surplus amounting to $ 1.9 billion , equivalent to 0.6% of GDP , in the second quarter of 1999 .  
The surplus in the second quarter represented the net effect of a visible trade deficit of $ 7.4 billion , an invisible trade surplus of $ 16.9 billion , a net external factor income inflow of $ 4.3 billion , and a net current transfer outflow of $ 2.6 billion .  
As Hong Kong 's exports improved along with the regional economic recovery and as the slack domestic demand continued to hold back imports retained for local use , the visible trade deficit narrowed further , from $ 8.8 billion in the first quarter of 1999 to $ 7.4 billion in the second quarter .  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
As for the other industries , notable increases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( by $ 0.5 billion or 36% to $ 1.9 billion ) ; the paper and paper products , printing and publishing industry ( by $ 0.3 billion or 25% to $ 1.5 billion ) ; and the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by $ 0.2 billion or 15% to $ 1.4 billion ) .  
Also , this more than offset the deficit in visible trade , giving a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , equivalent to 0.8% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .  
For example , in the 1998 loan agreement for financing the closed aqueduct project which upon completion should significantly improve quality of water supplied to Hong Kong , we have successfully obtained a total reduction of 560 million cubic metres in the supply quantities from 1998 to 2004 , amounting to a 10% reduction in the fixed annual supply quantities for the period and saving contract payments in the order of $ 1.8 billion .  
On the other hand , because of the strong growth in public sector civil engineering output , the gross value of construction work performed at public sector sites increased by 13.0% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier to $ 13.2 billion in the first quarter of 2000 .  
The resultant surplus for the year of $ 10 billion is marginally higher than the surplus of $ 9.9 billion announced when the provisional figures for the year were published on April 29 pending final closure of the annual accounts . 
As for the other industries , notable increases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the paper and paper products , printing and publishing industry ( by $ 0.3 billion or 21% to $ 1.7 billion ) ; the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by $ 0.1 billion or 10% to $ 1.5 billion ) ; and the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( by $ 0.1 billion or 5% to $ 1.6 billion ) .  
Comparing the first half of 2000 with the same period in 1999 , the value of re-exports by ocean for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions rose , with notable increases for miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 6.7 billion or 11.9% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 6.2 billion or 21.1% ) ; and electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 5.3 billion or 22.6% ) .  
Over the same period , notable increases were recorded in the value of domestic exports by air for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 2.5 billion or 30.3% ) ; clothing ( by $ 1.4 billion or 28.6% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 1.1 billion or 42.7% ) .  
The value of imports by air for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions rose in the first half of 2000 , with significant increases for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 27.0 billion or 52.5% ) ; office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 11.1 billion or 47.6% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 8.3 billion or 41.8% ) ; and non-metallic mineral manufactures ( by $ 5.0 billion or 39.6% ) .  
In 2000-2001 , $ 1.66 billion will be spent on family and child welfare services .  These cover a wide range of preventive , supportive and remedial services , including family casework service , child care service , services for battered spouses and abused children , family life education etc .  
Exports of services also surged on the back of the robust regional demand , yielding a substantial invisible trade surplus of $ 23.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , considerably enlarged from that of $ 14.8 billion in the same quarter in 1999 .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 66.7 billion and $ 65.3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 over the preceding quarter , reflecting the much improved regional and local investment situation upon the economic revival .  
Under the Order , the minimum levels of CSL under the existing administrative requirement ( ranging from US $ 25 million to US $ 1 billion depending on aircraft weight ) will continue to apply .  The only change is the addition of a US $ 15 million minimum CSL level for light aircraft .  This new level is to ensure adequate insurance cover while not imposing an excessive burden on light aircraft operators .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2000 with the first quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit was little changed at $ 19.3 billion , while the invisible trade surplus went up from $ 23.8 billion to $ 28.2 billion .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 78.5 billion and $ 137.1 billion during the second quarter of 2000 , reflecting the improved regional and local investment environment upon the economic revival .  
Comparing the third quarter of 2000 with the second quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 19.3 billion to $ 10.5 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 28.2 billion to $ 31.5 billion .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased , by $ 34.4 billion and $ 56.3 billion respectively during the third quarter of 2000 , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
What is particularly encouraging is that between 1999 and 2000 , the number of regional headquarters and offices established by multinational corporations in Hong Kong increased from 2,500 to 3,000 ; Hong Kong is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Asia after Mainland China , amounting to US $ 23.1 billion last year .  
Comparing 2000 with 1999 , notable increases in the value of domestic exports were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 4.7 billion or 19.9% ) ; clothing ( by $ 3.2 billion or 4.3% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of jewellery , goldsmiths ' and silversmiths ' wares ( by $ 2.2 billion or 15.6% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 2.0 billion or 34.1% ) .

The provisions for elderly welfare services will be increased twofold from $ 1.6 billion in the financial year 1997-98 to $ 3.2 billion in the next financial year .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2000 with the third quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 10.5 billion to $ 14.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 32.8 billion to $ 38.9 billion .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .  
Both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased markedly in 2000 , by $ 491.1 billion and $ 502.1 billion respectively , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
Overall , the combined visible and invisible trade account ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) remained in surplus , at $ 2 billion in the first quarter of 2001 , equivalent to 0.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  Yet these were smaller than the corresponding figures of $ 5 billion and 1.3% in the same quarter in 2000 .

First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

Per Capita Income by the Year 2000By the year 2000 , the per capita gross national product in the Republic of China on Taiwan will exceed US $ 20,000 , a level comparable to per capita income in the highly industrialized countries of the West , and one which ranks her among the top twenty countries of the world . Estimates are that by that time the ROC 's foreign trade turnover will reach US $ 350 billion , which will make the ROC the tenth biggest trading country in the entire world .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
It so happened that the project coincided with the Ministry of Communication 's hunt for a new deepwater port facility , and a joint outline was drawn up which envisioned a reclaimed land area of 6,700 hectares , and investment of some 400 billion NT dollars . The blueprint for eventual use of the dry land area is still undergoing approval at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
But if such views are optimistic , they do also seem to echo a voice that departed from the Chinese scene not all that long ago and which most people would not be happy to hear again . The idea that mainland China can achieve economic miracles if the population just gives up its lunch-time nap , the notion that if you multiply everything by 1.2 billion then you can beat the world , unavoidably harks back to earlier calls to " overtake Britain and catch up with America . "  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
" The Colon Free Trade Zone , the world 's longest running and most successful free trade zone , handled US $ 10 billion in transshipment trade in 1995 , a figure equivalent to Taiwan 's total yearly trade with Southeast Asia .  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total . The volume of imported materials and exported finished products will total 1.3 million tonnes per year , which will help Taichung Harbor develop into a major international commercial port .  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel . In 1996 , 5.71 million Taiwanese traveled abroad spending a total of US $ 8.15 billion , an amount equal to 46% of what Taiwan earned from trade in that year .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
Zhu Lilan stated that to maintain the steady development of basic scientific research , the mainland would allocate an additional RMB * 2 billion over the next five years for major new scientific engineering projects , and would also find an extra RMB * 2.5 billion to support research in such areas as energy and information technology .  
As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education . "  
At the same time , in order to stabilize a stock market battered by the news of financial crises at many firms , a stock market stabilization committee headed by the MOF held its first meeting on November 16 . The committee has confirmed that it has arranged for a total of NT $ 283 billion from a number of sources to buy shares . The sources of this money include postal deposits , the civil-service and labor pension funds , the labor insurance fund , the government-run banks and insurance companies .  
The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
If we developed all our hydroelectric resources to their full potential we would be able to generate over 5 gigawatts of electric power . It is our high mountains that bring down the rain and give us our abundant water . Average annual precipitation comes to 90 billion cubic meters , which gives the island a humid climate and luscious greenery .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
We decided to devote our special feature this month to the investments of Taiwanese businesses in mainland China , with which Taiwan has enjoyed annual trade surpluses of well over US $ 20 billion in recent years . We focus especially on the question of why Taiwanese high-tech manufacturers are moving offshore , and how they manage to keep afloat in the fiercely competitive market of the greater Shanghai region .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery . In the future , there will be a demand of US $ 2 billion for fries in the Asia-Pacific region . As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
In May of this year , the government formally declared " digital content " to be one of the " twin star " industries . It plans to pour NT $ 5 billion into the industry over the next four years , establish a " digital content college " that will cultivate IT skills among artists and writers , and encourage venture capitalists to invest also in the hope of growing the industry 's annual production value to more than NT $ 200 billion , four times its current value , in five years .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
As a matter of fact , after assuming the KMT chairmanship in March 2000 , Lien Chan stated that after a comprehensive examination of party assets and commercial investments , it had been discovered that during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , when Liu Tai-ying was director-general of the KMT 's Investment and Business Management Committee , there were eight highly controversial investment cases with combined total losses of NT $ 9.8 billion .  
According to the laws governing national health insurance , every five years a new set of rates should be calculated to cover the following five years . In addition , whenever the system 's reserve fund goes below the equivalent of medical costs for one month ( currently , that figure is about NT $ 250 billion ) , then the insurance rates can be raised automatically .  
With production costs reaching NT $ 1 billion and intensive promotional efforts that included inviting director Zhang , male lead Tony Leung , and female lead Maggie Cheung to Taiwan , Hero naturally delivered a dazzling box office performance .  
In addition to private entrepreneurs abandoning their hide-bound attitudes and moving forward hand in hand to develop the market , the Executive Yuan 's plan to double the number of foreign tourists was already on track last year with an estimated investment over the next six years of almost NT $ 80 billion and a yearly target for visitors to Taiwan in 2003 and beyond of three million , up from 2.6 million of previous years .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
This typhoon caused the people of Taoyuan a great deal of pain and suffering as they were forced to go without water for many days . Industrial losses are estimated at NT $ 10 billion . Heads of agencies at the local and central government level are exhausted by their efforts . The chairman and the CEO of Taiwan Water Corporation stepped down , and there was a strong reaction among the corporation 's employees .

CFIIT is the sole national economic and trade activity devoted to foreign direct investment attraction In the past three sessions , contracts for 6,708 investment and cooperation projects were signed with a total foreign investment of 37-249-billion US dollars , with the import and export trade volume amounting to 2 968 billion US dollars  
the opening momentum has attracted increasing numbers of foreign investors last year , jiangsu approved more than 8,000 foreign investment projects , for which pledged overseas capital reached close to 8 billion us dollars  
During the same period , total net official development finance fell by about 5 per cent in nominal terms to $ 66 billion in 1994 , after remaining relatively constant at around $ 70-billion between 1990 and 1993 .  
Although the total investment reached $ 95 billion in 1990 , it still fell short of the 25 per cent rate , which is normally the minimum level assumed to ensure Africa 's economic growth and a steady growth of the standard of living per capita .  
The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
The question should be asked whether it is fair to collect the debt owed by the countries where these people live , which in many cases accounts for more than half of their limited revenues , while in the United States alone , $ 8 billion are spent on cosmetics , in the rich countries , $ 17-billion are spent on pet food and , worldwide , $ 400-billion are spent on narcotic drugs . 
Translation of commitment to the goals of the Conference into commensurate levels of donor funding has not been forthcoming , and there is an urgent need for donor countries to renew and intensify efforts to meet the need for complementary external resources required to implement the costed elements of the Programme of Action , that is : ( in 1993 United States dollars ) $ 5.7-billion in 2000 , $ 6.1-billion in 2005 , $ 6.8 billion in 2010 and $ 7.2-billion in 2015 .

In total , the Organization owned , or leased at nominal cost , some 175 hectares of land and 1.1-million square metres of building floor area , which represented a major physical asset , since their replacement value was more than $ 5 billion .  
Last year alone , the Bank of China provided an accumulated total of more than 69 billion yuan of RMB loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  In addition , the bank also issued more than 4-billion US dollars in the form of foreign exchange rate and spot exchange rate loans to foreign-invested enterprises .  These loans were mainly to support the basic raw materials , chemical , and mechanical industries , etc .  
At the same time , China imported technology and complete sets of equipment from more than thirty countries and regions , and the total amount of contract funds has increased by nearly 50% over that of the " seventh five-year plan " period .  It also exported its technology to more than 50 countries and regions of the world , with contracting funds reaching more than 8 billion US dollars , increasing 2.7 times over that of the " seventh five-year plan " period .  
9.8 billion yuan for the establishment of science and technology development fund , a knowledge innovation project , and increased investment in basic science research and key scientific and technological projects , increasing by 14.6 percent as compared with the previous year ;  
During the visit , both sides signed six agreements including a petrochemical base cooperation project worth $ 6 billion and a coal mine fire fighting project .  The agreements inject new vitality into the two countries ' economic and trade cooperation and will produce a major and deep impact on the two countries ' long-term cooperation .  
Long fed up with noise caused by flight training of US military planes , some 5,500 Japanese citizens living near Kadena Air Base in Okinawa angrily filed a suit in Okinawa Prefecture Court on 27 March this year accusing the Japanese Government of an " illegal act " in allowing US forces to set up military bases in residential areas , calling on US forces to immediately cease night flights , and demanding 6 billion Japanese yen in reparation to victims .  
Before World War II , France spent 6 billion francs and moved 120-billion cubic meters of earth in building a vast permanent fortification system on its northeast border , naming it the " Maginot Line " after an army minister .  
The investment in the project of diverting river water from the west to the east will total 2.9-billion yuan .  All these are projects with an investment of several billion yuan .  If there are no standard bidding , supervisory , and acceptance-check systems and if power operations and non-transparent work still prevail , how can we guarantee that there are no officials blinded by self-interests to take graft and there are no " scums " to do harm to the public .  
This can mainly be seen from the following aspects : First , more and more Taiwan businessmen have come to Zhejiang to make investments .  Starting the year 1987 which witnessed the first Taiwan investment in Zhejiang , the total accumulated number of Zhejiang-Taiwan joint ventures that Zhejiang has approved and established has exceeded 3,000 over the past dozen years ; and this has brought a total investment of $ 6.8 billion to our province , of which contractual investment amounts to some $ 5 billion while over $ 3-billion has been put to actual use .  
Regardless of the strong protest of the Chinese Government , the US Government announced on 23 April its decision to sell Taiwan several billion US dollars ' worth of advanced weapons , including " Kidd-class " destroyers , diesel-power submarines , and P-3 anti-submarine patrol aircraft .  This move taken by the US government is a flagrant breach of the principles stated in the three Sino-US joint communiques that the US Government has repeatedly committed itself to ;  
By the end of May 2001 , the park had invested an accumulated total of over 8 billion yuan on the construction of its infrastructure , had used $ 4.2-billion of foreign capital , carried out construction on an area of 12 square km , completed the construction of high-level infrastructure , initially set up groups of advanced and high-tech industries with the electronics , information , precision machines , biological pharmaceutics and new materials industries as their core , and established a new management structure and operation mechanism .  
Patriotism is a banner for mobilizing and motivating the billion Chinese people to struggle in unison , an enormous force for driving society and history forward , and a common spiritual pillar for people of all nationalities .  
At present , China input in agricultural scientific research , only more than 5 billion yuan , is very low , and the per-capita operating expenses for agricultural scientific research units at the county level or above are only 10,000 yuan .  If the scientific research input is increased by 5 percent annually , it will take 45 years for China to catch up with the level of developed countries in the 1980s .  
The foundation of the two countries ' complementary and mutually beneficial economic , trade , and military relationship is solid ; China is Russia 's sixth largest trading partner , and Russia is China 's ninth ; last year their bilateral trade totalled $ 8 billion .  
The average annual indirect income should come to 150 to 200 billion yuan if calculated according to a ratio of one-to-two to three ( a conservative estimate ) between direct incomes from civil aviation and the indirect incomes ( tourist , insurance , and postal earnings for instance ) .  
Both markets posted an average gain of more than nine percent at the close , with the total volume of transaction almost touching 50 billion .  This was typical of a market situation where stock prices and transaction volumes go up hand in hand .  
At present , the State Development Bank has extended loans to central and western regions with a total of nearly 400 billion yuan .  In Gansu , Qinghai and Ningxia , the bank has successively supported state and local key construction projects such as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Gas Field , the Lan-Xin Railway , the Daxia Hydroelectric Power State , the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metal Mine , the Ningxia Power Plant , the Qinghai Oil Field and the Lijiaxia Hydroelectric Power Station .  
The total accumulated known deposits of natural gas in China 's western region is 1,500 billion cubic meters and the annual production capacity has reached 18 billion cubic meters , which far exceed the actual local need .  
Beijing 's annual average volume of utilizable water resources is about 4.1 billion cubic meters .  Judging from the existing facilities and management level , this does not come up to the requirements for turning Beijing into an international metropolis and a city with first-rate environmental quality .  
In his briefing to a news conference , which held by the Information Office of the State Council today , Liu Hong said : In 1999 , China 's gross domestic product topped the mark of 8,000 billion yuan , or an increased of 7.1 percent over the previous year calculated on comparable items , thus achieving the expected growth target . 
Sheng Huaren said : In its economic and trade work in 1999 , China made good progress in the areas of controlling the aggregate supply , making structural readjustment , deepening the reform , and improving economic returns and was expected to comprehensively achieve the major projected targets .  The economic returns of state-owned industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises where the state holds a controlling interest were distinctly better than in 1998 and could top 70 billion yuan , or 40 percent more than the projected target , for the whole year .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .  
By the end of 1997 , there were 7,617 environmental protection enterprises in China , with the total fixed assets amounting to 62.09 billion yuan .  They have formed a pattern under which the state-owned enterprises are developing alongside the township collective enterprises and private enterprises .  
" Last year Tibet Autonomous Region , which has a population of 2.5 million , saw its economic development staying above the national average level of growth for the sixth consecutive year and turned in a GDP of Renminbi 10.335 billion yuan , up 9.1 percent from the previous year .  
The Soviet Union was all along reticent about the true figures of its military spending .  The total amount of its defense expenditures , published for the first time in 1989 , was 77.3 billion rubles .  It was further admitted in 1990 that its military spending represented one-fourth of its national budget .  
He said : The one China principle is an inevitable conclusion of China 's historical development over 5,000 years , is the objective condition shaped in the history of cross-strait relations , is the basic norm respected and observed by the international community and international laws , and is a fact commonly accepted by the 1.3 billion Chinese people ( including most Taiwan compatriots ) and tens of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots .

Although its foreign aid amount rose to $ 14 billion in 1999 , it accounted for only 0.15 percent of its total output value that year , which was $ 9 trillion .  Moreover , $ 3 billion of this money was specifically reserved for its ally Israel and $ 2.1 billion for Egypt , which signed a peace treaty with Israel . France can be regarded as relatively generous .  
The overall living standard has witnessed a historic change from simply having enough food and clothing to leading a relatively comfortable life .  Compared with 1995 , Xinjiang 's fiscal revenue nearly doubled to 13.55 billion yuan , with annual growth of 14.5 percent .

The major countries where Taiwan purchased its weapons from were : The United States , $ 8.1 billion ; and France , $ 5.15 billion .  
By contrast , the mainland China developed most of its military weapons by itself .  During the same period , it purchased a total of $ 2.59 billion worth of regular weapons from around the world , ranking 14th in the world .  The key country where the mainland China purchased its weapons from was Russia , from which $ 2.12 billion worth of weapons were imported .

When inspecting Fort Stewart military base as commander-in-chief of armed forces for the first time on Monday this week , Bush announced that the military expenditure for the next fiscal year would be increased by another $ 14 billion , bringing the total US military budget to $ 31 billion .  
However , it is now unrealistic to place our hope on the WTO because mainland China is in no hurry to join the WTO . On the contrary , the Chinese communist authorities believe that so long as they can maintain an annual inflow of $ 40 billion of foreign capital into mainland China , they can attain the same results in improving the economy and state-owned undertakings as joining the WTO .

Our nation has accomplished the two historic changes from poverty to getting sufficient food and clothing , and then from getting sufficient food and clothing to enjoying a comparatively better-off life .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
CPPCC Member Zhang Chunyuan answered a reporter 's question concerning the planning of this south-to-north water diversion project : Basing on their studies and verifications over the past 50 years , departments in charge of water conservancy have decided on a water diversion plan by which water will be diverted from the south to the north of China along three lines , namely , the east , the central , and the west lines , with a total water diversion volume of 38-40 billion cubic meters .  
Nine hundred million of the total of over 1.2 billion people are in the rural areas .  The key to expanding domestic demand lies in developing the rural market , trying by every possible means to increase the peasants ' income , and turning the potential purchasing power in rural areas into actual purchasing power .

In answering a relevant question raised by a foreign journalist , Zhu Bangzao said that the US military spending this year is $ 14 billion more than last year and this increase is almost equivalent to China 's national defense spending last year .  Double standard should not be used on this issue .  
The volume of trade between the two sides accounts for 40 percent of Hong Kong 's foreign trade volume .  In the period of the " Tenth Five-Year Plan , " the volume of import and export trade of the mainland will increased to $ 680 billion , and a large part of the cargoes will be transported via Hong Kong . This will directly benefit Hong Kong 's economic development , and will be favorable to giving play to Hong Kong 's advantages as an international financial , trade , and shipping center .  
Under such circumstances , if Sichuan fails to develop itself or fails to develop itself fast enough , it will surely fall behind .  In view of this , we must firmly grasp the main line of conducting strategic economic restructuring ; and must ensure that the province 's GDP can total 589 billion yuan by 2005 , growing at an average annual rate of 8 percent and above .  
From 1996 to 2000 , China took in direct foreign investment in the amount of $ 2134.8 billion ( amount actually received ) , an 87 percent increase in comparison to the " Eighth Five-Year Plan " , while the annual average of foreign capital taken in held steady at more than US $ 40 billion .  
Tibet 's GNP last year was estimated to be 11.65 billion yuan , an average annual increase of 10.7 percent .  Agriculture has had 13 consecutive years of bumper harvests , with the total volume of grain estimated to be 946,700 tons , a first step in accomplishing self-sufficiency in grains , oils and meat .  The average net income of those engaged in farming or animal husbandry is estimated to have reached 1,325 yuan , while the estimated per capita budgeted income for urban residents was 6,385 yuan , an average annual increase of 9.8 percent .

The Directorate General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics ( DGBAS ) says that 1989 was an important watershed in the ROC 's financial income and outlay .  During the 40 years from 1950 until 1989 , the central government accumulated a total of just NT $ 191 billion in debt , and was in a very stable financial situation .  During the same period , the ROC 's economic growth rate was unparalleled in the world , with an average annual growth rate of 8.9% .  
At present our country 's total annual water supply was 560 billion cubic meters .  With the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of our economy and society , our demand for fine quality fresh water is increasing daily .  
Besides , the total quantity of water to be diverted from southern China to northern region during first phase and second phase will be only 50 billion cubic meters , accounting for just one-fourth of the need .  Therefore , judging from the current situation or a long-range plan , we still must place the economical use of water in first place .  
Ours is a big developing country with a population of nearly 1.3 billion , where the level of economic and social development and the people 's living standards are still rather low ; in such a situation , our country also has a tremendous demand potential and very vast market space .  
With reserves of that size , he said , Hong Kong had a government with no debt ; accumulated fiscal reserves around US $ 48 billion ; a simple tax system and corporate and personal taxes at a level amongst the lowest in the world . 
In the second quarter of 1997 , domestic exports classified to the consumer electrical and electronic products industry decreased by 8% over a year earlier to $ 5.9 billion ; and those to the wearing apparel industry decreased by 6% to $ 8.8 billion .  
Hong Kong is an international financial centre and also a major financing base for Mainland enterprises .  Since 1993 , a total of 34 Mainland enterprises have been listed in Hong Kong , raising more than HK $ 50 billion .

Over the same period , more notable increases in the value of domestic exports were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 1.3 billion or 6.5% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 1 billion or 48% ) .  
Over the same period , more notable increases in the value of domestic exports were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 1.8 billion or 7.9% ) ; clothing ( by $ 1.4 billion or 2.7% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 1.1 billion or 47% ) .  
" Of this , $ 16.2 billion comes from higher than expected receipts from stamp duty , reflecting the exceptional level of turnover in both the stock and property markets in the first half of the financial year . 
" Of course , our US $ 92.8 billion foreign reserves , the third largest in the world , and our healthy banking and financial systems as well as our strong economic fundamentals , have all played a vital role in enabling us to maintain the linked exchange rate , " he said .  
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
Comparing the first two months of 1998 with the same period in 1997 , more notable increases in the value of re-exports were registered for office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 2.0 billion or 16% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 816 million or 4.3% ) ; and telecommunications and sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 795 million or 4.9% ) .  
Our confidence in Hong Kong 's prosperous future has not been eroded by the Asian financial turmoil .  In the coming five years , the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will invest HK $ 235 billion in a wide range of large-scale infrastructural projects , including the construction of railways , highways and educational facilities , to consolidate further the foundation for the long term development of Hong Kong and for the enhancement of Hong Kong 's competitiveness .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion - ladies and gentlemen , the government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8% of our GDP in the current year , we are able to , through the budget recently announced for this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
Comparing the first quarter of 1998 with the same period in 1997 , more notable increases in the value of re-exports were registered for office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 3.0 billion or 15% ) ; telecommunications and sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 2.5 billion or 10% ) ; and miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 2.2 billion or 7.7% ) .  
Because of our very strong fiscal reserves of HK $ 450 billion ( A $ 100 billion ) - the Government has no debt - and with a budget surplus of 5.8 per cent of our GDP in the past year , we are able to , through the budget announced in February this year , continue with our massive plan of investment in infrastructure and education which will make Hong Kong much more efficient and competitive in the 21st Century . 
Analysed by end-use , residential building projects ( including commercial and residential composite buildings ) accounted for the largest portion of the gross value of construction work performed at construction sites .  The gross value of construction work performed for these projects was $ 10.9 billion in nominal terms , representing a notable increase of 37% over a year earlier .  
Analysed by end-use , residential building projects ( including commercial and residential composite buildings ) accounted for the largest proportion of the gross value of construction work performed at construction sites .  The gross value of construction work performed for these projects was $ 12.2 billion in nominal terms , representing a notable increase of 49% over a year earlier .  
The rest of $ 70 billion are either statutory or contractual payments which we are required to pay under existing policies .  Examples are pensions , social security and legal aid .  It would be difficult to achieve a quantified 5% gain within two to three years in respect of these payments .  
Although the accumulated reserves of HK $ 450 billion gave Hong Kong the financial strength to tide over present difficulties , the Government must find the resources to continue to invest in the future , and to provide the modern infrastructure in supporting Hong Kong 's role as a major economic player on the world stage , she said .  
In addition , the Government will establish an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to provide " mid-stream " research , which is pivotal in linking basic scientific research to its commercial applications ; set up a $ 5 billion Innovation and Technology Fund to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading in the manufacturing and service industries ; establish a $ 5 billion Quality Education Fund for grants to raise school standards through innovation ; and facilitate technology collaboration between academic institutions and the business community .  
Given both the cost of the relief measures announced on June 22 , and the effects of the current global financial crisis , we expect the budget deficit for the current year to be substantially in excess of $ 20 billion , which will entail an equivalent reduction in the level of the fiscal reserves .  
As for the other industries , notable decreases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( - $ 0.6 billion or - 26 per cent to $ 1.6 billion ) and the professional and optical equipment industry ( - $ 0.5 billion or - 13 per cent to $ 3.4 billion ) .  
Analysed by end-use , residential building projects ( including commercial and residential composite buildings ) accounted for the largest proportion of the gross value of construction work performed at construction sites .  The gross value of construction work performed for these projects was $ 12.1 billion in nominal terms , representing a notable increase of 32% over a year earlier .  
For HOS Operating Account , an increase in income is projected for the 1999 / 2000 budget over the revised budget for 1998 / 99 .  However , an increase in expenditure from $ 7.2 billion in 1998 / 99 to $ 17.6 billion in 1999 / 2000 , due to a much higher number of HOS units completed in the coming year , is expected to cause the surplus level to drop by $ 5 billion to $ 10.1 billion .  
As for the other industries , notable decreases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the professional and optical equipment industry ( by about $ 1.8 billion or 12% to $ 12.7 billion ) ; the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( by about $ 1.5 billion or 18% to $ 6.7 billion ) ; and the food industry ( by about $ 1.5 billion or 44% to $ 1.8 billion ) .  
A total of 38 new secondary schools will also be built in the four school years from 1999-2000 at a capital cost of $ 3.89 billion to meet the demand for additional school places .  The full year additional recurrent expenditure is $ 1.38 billion .  
Turning to social welfare , Mrs Fok said the $ 29.1 billion recurrent expenditure for 1999 / 2000 represented 14.1 per cent of the total Government recurrent expenditure and a real growth of 13.6 per cent over the figure for the current financial year .  
The Government has already allocated a very substantial proportion of public funds to the welfare sector on an annual basis , in terms of capital and recurrent resources .  In the financial year 1999 / 2000 , the subvention for direct services will rise to $ 6.2 billion from $ 5.4 billion .  
To strengthen the capability of our private sector in developing innovative ideas for commercial use , I have accepted two key recommendations of the Commission on Innovation and Technology . Firstly , the establishment of an Applied Science and Technology Research Institute to support and stimulate mid-stream research .  Secondly , the setting up of an Innovation and Technology Fund of HK $ 5 billion to finance projects which will contribute to innovation and technological upgrading of our manufacturing and service industries .  
The paper indicates that to meet the needs of the eligible persons of the first and second generations alone in respect of the major areas identified in the paper , our taxpayers will have to shoulder a capital expenditure of $ 710 billion in ten years , while the recurrent expenditure of various services will reach $ 33 billion annually by the tenth year . 
On the basis that the first generation of 692,000 eligible residents from the Mainland would be absorbed within the next three years , we expect that an additional $ 3.5 billion ( inclusive of social security ) would be required in each year , covering both recurrent and capital expenditure , in the first seven years .  
Comparing the first half of 1999 with the same period in 1998 , decreases of various magnitudes were registered in the value of re-exports by ocean for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions , with notable decreases for telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 6.4 billion or 17.9% ) ; footwear ( by $ 3.8 billion or 14.8% ) ; and miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 3.0 billion or 5.0% ) . 
The value of domestic exports by air for most of the principal divisions fell in the first half of 1999 .  Decreases were recorded for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 2.1 billion or 20.7% ) ; and photographic apparatus , equipment and supplies , optical goods , watches and clocks ( by $ 986 million or 25.0% ) .  
She said Government expenditure would be increased by 3% in real terms in 2000-01 ( or $ 5.4 billion in additional spending ) This amount , together with the EPP savings of $ 1 billion , means an extra $ 6.4 billion for the delivery of all pledges on new or improved services made in the prevailing and two previous Policy Addresses . 
As for other industries , notable decreases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the professional and optical equipment industry ( by about $ 1.3 billion or 39% to $ 2.1 billion ) ; the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by about $ 0.1 billion or 9% to $ 1.4 billion ) ; and the plastic products industry ( by about $ 0.1 billion or 20% to $ 0.6 billion ) .  
Comparing the first 11 months of 1999 with the same period in 1998 , increases in the value of imports were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 9.6 billion or 5.4% ) ; non-metallic mineral manufactures ( by $ 4.3 billion or 13.1% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 3.8 billion or 3.8% ) ; and office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 3.7 billion or 4.0% ) .  
The combined visible and invisible trade surplus increased to $ 4.1 billion in the first quarter of 1999 .  The net external factor income inflow also rose , to $ 9.3 billion .  
The cash position of the Authority is forecast to remain reasonably strong and is expected to improve from the current level of $ 15 billion to $ 32.2 billion at 31 March 2001 with increased number of HOS / PSPS flats to be completed and sold .  
Comparing 1999 with 1998 , increases in the value of re-exports were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 24.4 billion or 18.5% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 6.3 billion or 4.1% ) ; office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 5.2 billion or 5.6% ) ; clothing ( by $ 2.5 billion or 2.6% ) ; and plastics in primary forms ( by $ 1.6 billion or 5.7% ) .  
Comparing 1999 with 1998 , increases in the value of imports were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 17.0 billion or 8.7% ) ; office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 5.1 billion or 5.0% ) ; non-metallic mineral manufactures ( by $ 5.1 billion or 14.5% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 5.0 billion or 4.7% ) ; and clothing ( by $ 3.7 billion or 3.4% ) .  
The value of domestic exports by ocean for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions fell in 1999 , with decreases for clothing ( by $ 4.2 billion or 8.6% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of printed matter ( by $ 656 million or 11.6% ) ; office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 557 million or 20.6% ) ; and electrical machinery , apparatus and appliance , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 283 million or 13.4% ) .  
In the past three financial years as well as the current one ( four financial years ) , the total expenditure of the Government , the former provisional municipal councils and the Housing Authority on public works is about $ 188 billion , i.e . $ 47 billion per year on average .  
Mr Wong noted that the Government would allocate an additional $ 1.24 billion in the coming financial year for the new initiatives on education and manpower , of which $ 300 million would be spent on promoting employment and encouraging continuing education , $ 140 million to help needy students and $ 800 million for implementing the education reform .  
As compared with the current financial year , the total education expenditure represents an increase of 4.1 per cent in nominal terms and four per cent in real terms .  Of the $ 54.4 billion , $ 36.1 billion ( 66.4 per cent ) will be on basic education , $ 18.3 billion ( 33.6 per cent ) be on tertiary education .  
As the local and regional economic environment stabilised , Hong Kong recorded a further BoP surplus amounting to $ 1.9 billion , equivalent to 0.6% of GDP , in the second quarter of 1999 .  
The surplus in the second quarter represented the net effect of a visible trade deficit of $ 7.4 billion , an invisible trade surplus of $ 16.9 billion , a net external factor income inflow of $ 4.3 billion , and a net current transfer outflow of $ 2.6 billion .  
As Hong Kong 's exports improved along with the regional economic recovery and as the slack domestic demand continued to hold back imports retained for local use , the visible trade deficit narrowed further , from $ 8.8 billion in the first quarter of 1999 to $ 7.4 billion in the second quarter .  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
As for the other industries , notable increases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( by $ 0.5 billion or 36% to $ 1.9 billion ) ; the paper and paper products , printing and publishing industry ( by $ 0.3 billion or 25% to $ 1.5 billion ) ; and the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by $ 0.2 billion or 15% to $ 1.4 billion ) .  
Also , this more than offset the deficit in visible trade , giving a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , equivalent to 0.8% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  
With exports of services rising on the back of improved regional demand but imports of services still falling amidst a weak local demand , the invisible trade surplus surged to $ 80.7 billion in 1999 , from $ 66.7 billion in 1998 .  
For example , in the 1998 loan agreement for financing the closed aqueduct project which upon completion should significantly improve quality of water supplied to Hong Kong , we have successfully obtained a total reduction of 560 million cubic metres in the supply quantities from 1998 to 2004 , amounting to a 10% reduction in the fixed annual supply quantities for the period and saving contract payments in the order of $ 1.8 billion .  
On the other hand , because of the strong growth in public sector civil engineering output , the gross value of construction work performed at public sector sites increased by 13.0% in nominal terms compared with a year earlier to $ 13.2 billion in the first quarter of 2000 .  
The resultant surplus for the year of $ 10 billion is marginally higher than the surplus of $ 9.9 billion announced when the provisional figures for the year were published on April 29 pending final closure of the annual accounts . 
As for the other industries , notable increases in the value of domestic exports were recorded for the paper and paper products , printing and publishing industry ( by $ 0.3 billion or 21% to $ 1.7 billion ) ; the chemicals and chemical products industry ( by $ 0.1 billion or 10% to $ 1.5 billion ) ; and the basic metals and fabricated metal products industry ( by $ 0.1 billion or 5% to $ 1.6 billion ) .  
Comparing the first half of 2000 with the same period in 1999 , the value of re-exports by ocean for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions rose , with notable increases for miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 6.7 billion or 11.9% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 6.2 billion or 21.1% ) ; and electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 5.3 billion or 22.6% ) .  
Over the same period , notable increases were recorded in the value of domestic exports by air for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 2.5 billion or 30.3% ) ; clothing ( by $ 1.4 billion or 28.6% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 1.1 billion or 42.7% ) .  
The value of imports by air for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions rose in the first half of 2000 , with significant increases for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 27.0 billion or 52.5% ) ; office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 11.1 billion or 47.6% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 8.3 billion or 41.8% ) ; and non-metallic mineral manufactures ( by $ 5.0 billion or 39.6% ) .  
In 2000-2001 , $ 1.66 billion will be spent on family and child welfare services .  These cover a wide range of preventive , supportive and remedial services , including family casework service , child care service , services for battered spouses and abused children , family life education etc .  
Exports of services also surged on the back of the robust regional demand , yielding a substantial invisible trade surplus of $ 23.8 billion in the first quarter of 2000 , considerably enlarged from that of $ 14.8 billion in the same quarter in 1999 .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 66.7 billion and $ 65.3 billion in the first quarter of 2000 over the preceding quarter , reflecting the much improved regional and local investment situation upon the economic revival .  
Under the Order , the minimum levels of CSL under the existing administrative requirement ( ranging from US $ 25 million to US $ 1 billion depending on aircraft weight ) will continue to apply .  The only change is the addition of a US $ 15 million minimum CSL level for light aircraft .  This new level is to ensure adequate insurance cover while not imposing an excessive burden on light aircraft operators .  
Thus , even with a larger deficit on the visible trade account , there was still a combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34 billion in the first three quarters of 2000 , equivalent to 2.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2000 with the first quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit was little changed at $ 19.3 billion , while the invisible trade surplus went up from $ 23.8 billion to $ 28.2 billion .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased appreciably , by $ 78.5 billion and $ 137.1 billion during the second quarter of 2000 , reflecting the improved regional and local investment environment upon the economic revival .  
Comparing the third quarter of 2000 with the second quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 19.3 billion to $ 10.5 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 28.2 billion to $ 31.5 billion .  
On direct investment ( DI ) flows , both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased , by $ 34.4 billion and $ 56.3 billion respectively during the third quarter of 2000 , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
What is particularly encouraging is that between 1999 and 2000 , the number of regional headquarters and offices established by multinational corporations in Hong Kong increased from 2,500 to 3,000 ; Hong Kong is the second largest recipient of foreign direct investment in Asia after Mainland China , amounting to US $ 23.1 billion last year .  
Comparing 2000 with 1999 , notable increases in the value of domestic exports were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 4.7 billion or 19.9% ) ; clothing ( by $ 3.2 billion or 4.3% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of jewellery , goldsmiths ' and silversmiths ' wares ( by $ 2.2 billion or 15.6% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 2.0 billion or 34.1% ) .  
Comparing 2000 with 1999 , the value of re-exports by ocean for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions rose , with notable increases for telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 16.0 billion or 24.2% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 14.3 billion or 10.6% ) ; electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 9.8 billion or 18.5% ) ; and clothing ( by $ 8.2 billion or 11.0% ) .

I am pleased to know that the Government 's initiatives to improve the elderly services are already bearing fruit .  Over the past three years and a half , we have made a good deal of efforts .  The provisions for elderly welfare services will be increased twofold from $ 1.6 billion in the financial year 1997-98 to $ 3.2 billion in the next financial year .  
Comparing the fourth quarter of 2000 with the third quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 10.5 billion to $ 14.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 32.8 billion to $ 38.9 billion .  
This was the combined result of a marked increase in visible trade deficit from $ 24.5 billion to $ 64.0 billion , a decrease in net external factor income inflow from $ 34.8 billion to $ 21.5 billion , and an increase in net outflow of current transfers from $ 11.9 billion to $ 12.7 billion , which were offset in part by a marked rise in invisible trade surplus from $ 90.7 billion to $ 123.8 billion .  
Both Hong Kong 's DI abroad and foreign DI in Hong Kong increased markedly in 2000 , by $ 491.1 billion and $ 502.1 billion respectively , reflecting general improvement in the regional and local investment environment upon the sustained economic recovery .  
Overall , the combined visible and invisible trade account ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) remained in surplus , at $ 2 billion in the first quarter of 2001 , equivalent to 0.5% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter .  Yet these were smaller than the corresponding figures of $ 5 billion and 1.3% in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2001 with the fourth quarter of 2000 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit widened from $ 14.9 billion to $ 24.6 billion , while the invisible trade surplus was reduced from $ 38.0 billion to $ 26.9 billion .  
The deficit of $ 7.8 billion and the closing balance of the fiscal reserves of $ 430.3 billion are the same as the provisional figures for the year which were published on April 28 , 2001 , pending the final closure of the annual accounts .  
Comparing the first half of 2001 with the same period in 2000 , notable increases in the value of imports were registered for office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 5.4 billion or 8.3% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 5.1 billion or 7.3% ) ; clothing ( by $ 2.9 billion or 5.5% ) ; and photographic apparatus , equipment and supplies , optical goods , watches and clocks ( by $ 2.8 billion or 9.9% ) .  
Comparing the first half of 2001 with the same period in 2000 , notable decreases were recorded in the value of re-exports by ocean for miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 5.8 billion or 9.1% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 1.3 billion or 3.8% ) ; and footwear ( by $ 1.2 billion or 5.3% ) .  
Over the same period , the value of domestic exports by air for all of the top-five principal commodity divisions fell , with notable decreases recorded for clothing ( by $ 1.9 billion or 29.6% ) ; professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 1.6 billion or 41.1% ) ; and electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 1.0 billion or 9.9% ) .  
The value of imports by air for most of the principal commodity divisions rose in the first half of 2001 , with significant increases recorded for office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 4.5 billion or 13.0% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 4.1 billion or 14.4% ) ; and photographic apparatus , equipment and supplies , optical goods , watches and clocks ( by $ 2.5 billion or 22.0% ) .  
Taken together , there was still a combined visible and invisible trade surplus ( having incorporated an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) amounting to $ 11.3 billion in the first half of 2001 , equivalent to 1.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that period .  
Yet the invisible trade surplus expanded further on the back of sustained notable growth in inbound tourism and offshore trade , from $ 28.6 billion in the second quarter of 2000 to $ 32.4 billion in the second quarter of 2001 .  
Comparing the second quarter with the first quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 24.6 billion to $ 23.9 billion , while the invisible trade surplus increased from $ 27.5 billion to $ 32.4 billion .  
We are washed by the same body of water and we are pretty much all in the same boat .  This is some boat .  The 21 member economies of APEC are home to some 2.5 billion people ; represent 44% of global trade ; and in 1999 had a combined gross domestic product of US $ 18 trillion .  
The Leisure and Cultural Services Department ( LCSD ) has drawn up an accelerated programme for the delivery of 64 capital works projects in the coming five years involving leisure and cultural facilities at a total estimated cost of $ 8.7 billion to meet community demands .  
Comparing the first nine months of 2001 with the same period in 2000 , notable decreases were registered in the value of imports of electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 13.3 billion or 6.3% ) ; textiles ( by $ 7.4 billion or 9.3% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 5.0 billion or 5.3% ) ; and plastics in primary forms ( by $ 4.5 billion or 13.8% ) .  
Taken together , there was still a combined visible and invisible trade surplus ( having incorporated an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) of $ 34.2 billion , equivalent to 2.6% of the total value of imports of goods and services , in the first three quarters of 2001 , as compared to $ 36.9 billion or 2.7% in the same period in 2000 . 
Instead of the US $ 16 billion asset size criterion , it is proposed that foreign banks should be subject to the same size criteria with respect to total assets and customer deposits as locally incorporated banks ( proposed to be increased to HK $ 5 billion and HK $ 4 billion respectively ) , thereby applying a consistent treatment to all applicants for a banking licence - irrespective of their place of incorporation . 
Based on the average salaries of a certificated master / mistress and graduate master / mistress , the additional recurrent expenditure required will be nearly $ 4 billion .  
Despite the deterioration of the external environment which has clouded Hong Kong 's economic outlook , general insurance business continued to grow with gross premiums increasing by 11.8% to $ 15.0 billion for the first three quarters of 2001 , compared with the corresponding period for the previous year .  The first three-quarter underwriting results also improved with a modest profit of $ 109 million .  
Comparing the third quarter of 2001 with the second quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 23.9 billion to $ 11.4 billion , while the invisible trade surplus increased from $ 32.8 billion to $ 34.8 billion .  
3 .  Rents charged by the Housing Authority are insufficient to meet recurrent operating expenses .  The Housing Authority 's rental deficit for 2001-02 is in the region of $ 2.7 billion , which works out to be an average subsidy of $ 4,000 per household .  
Comparing 2001 with 2000 , the value of re-exports by ocean for most of the principal commodity divisions fell , with notable decreases recorded for miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 19.5 billion or 13.1% ) ; telecommunications , sound recording and reproducing apparatus and equipment ( by $ 8.4 billion or 10.3% ) ; and footwear ( by $ 4.2 billion or 9.0% ) .

First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

Overall , a combined visible and invisible trade surplus of $ 34.1 billion was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 , larger than that of $ 20.7 billion in the same quarter in 2000 .  
Amongst the main current account components , the visible trade deficit narrowed from $ 11.4 billion to $ 5.0 billion , while the invisible trade surplus expanded further from $ 35.1 billion to $ 39.1 billion .  
By the end of this financial year , the actual expenditure on the capital works programme is expected to be about $ 24.8 billion .  This slightly exceeds our original target of $ 24.5 billion as a result of the satisfactory progress of a number of major projects .  
In line with the increase in loan applications , new loans approved during March increased to HK $ 9.3 billion .  While the proportion of new approvals for transactions in the primary market and refinancing loans rose to 44.4% and 17.8% of total new loans approved respectively , those in respect of the secondary market decreased to 37.8% .  
While core infrastructure projects completed in the last five years have enhanced the competitive edge of Hong Kong as a major regional business and transportation hub , the HKSAR Government 's commitment to invest C $ 120 billion in future infrastructure developments will ensure that Hong Kong will continue to be a world-class business city with a pleasant living environment for its citizens and visitors . 
Taken together , the combined surplus ( including an estimate of imports of gold for industrial use ) rose to $ 20.5 billion in the first quarter of 2002 , equivalent to 5.3% of the total value of imports of goods and services .  This was considerably up from the respective surplus figures of $ 3.2 billion and 0.8% in the same quarter in 2001 .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2002 with the fourth quarter of 2001 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the current account surplus decreased from $ 41.5 billion to $ 31.8 billion .  
Amongst the main current account components , the visible trade deficit increased from $ 5.0 billion to $ 12.4 billion , while the invisible trade surplus decreased from $ 39.5 billion to $ 32.9 billion .  
Comparing the first half of 2002 with the same period in 2001 , decreases were registered in the value of imports of photographic apparatus , equipment and supplies , optical goods , watches and clocks ( by $ 5.3 billion or 17.1% ) ; miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of baby carriages , toys , games and sporting goods ( by $ 4.9 billion or 8.9% ) ; clothing ( by $ 3.1 billion or 5.6% ) ; textiles ( by $ 2.6 billion or 5.4% ) ; and footwear ( by $ 1.7 billion or 8.2% ) .

The paper estimated that some 15-25% of the total outstanding Hong Kong dollar stock ( around HK $ 15-25 billion ) was held outside of Hong Kong . Most of it was held in the southern parts of Mainland China , where the demand for Hong Kong dollars had grown in recent years , despite a stable renminbi .  
He said , " since China 's opening up and economic restructuring , economic activities between the two places has become more rampant .  Hong Kong is now a major trading partner of Jiangsu Province . It is also a main source of foreign investments for the province .  As of October this year , the number of investment projects in the province involving HK capitals has passed the 18,000 mark , with a total contracted investment of US $ 27 billion .  
The gross operating surplus of the construction sector , which is equal to gross output less total operating expenditure , decreased by 5% from a year earlier to $ 9.7 billion in 2001 .  
The gross surplus of the transport sector , which is equal to total receipts less operating expenses and compensation of employees , decreased by 19% from a year earlier to $ 33.1 billion in 2001 .  
Besides , the Chief Executive also acknowledged that the civil service had made remarkable contributions in achieving a savings of $ 6 billion and a 10 per cent reduction in civil service establishment while assuring the quality of public services in increasing productivity under the Enhanced Productivity Programme .  
For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were registered for electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 3.3 billion or 21.8% ) ; and professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 2.5 billion or 68.3% ) in 2002 .  
Mr Leung also pointed out that a critical mass of middle class consumers had been formed in the PRD as well as in the Yangtze River Delta and other coastal cities following a breakneck development in China . The combined " middle-class " consumer population is estimated at over 200 million , with a market volume estimated at over US $ 560 billion , growing at a rate of about 10 per cent per annum .  
* After implementation of the expenditure and revenue measures set out in the 2003-04 Budget Speech plus the remaining $ 6 billion additional revenue to be raised in the next few years , we forecast declining consolidated deficits and operating deficits in the coming years 2003-04 to 2005-06 and a return to fiscal balance from 2006-07 .  
In regard to capital expenditure , we need to set aside about $ 0.3 billion for the installation of particulate reduction devices on pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles , and for the provision of a one-off grant to encourage early replacement of diesel public light buses with liquefied petroleum gas ( LPG ) or electric ones to further improve roadside air quality .  
* a DPS Fund - with a target fund size of 0.3% of the banking sector 's total amount of protected deposits , which is equivalent to approximately HK $ 1.6 billion at the current level of deposits - would be built up in approximately five years  
Since 1998 , the size of the retained mortgage portfolio has grown at an annual compound rate of 25.6% to the current amount of HK $ 28.3 billion , which is close to 5% of the residential mortgage loan market , " said Mr . Antony Leung , Chairman of the Board of Directors of the HKMC in the report .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2003 with the same period in 2002 , decreases were registered in the value of domestic exports of electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof ( by $ 1.6 billion or 38.5% ) ; photographic apparatus , equipment and supplies , optical goods , watches and clocks ( by $ 442 million or 55.5% ) ; professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus ( by $ 419 million or 56.8% ) ; and office machines and automatic data processing machines ( by $ 253 million or 17.8% ) .  
The combined visible and invisible trade surplus still expanded , to $ 24.1 billion in the first quarter of 2003 , equivalent to 5.4% of the total value of imports of goods and services in that quarter , from the corresponding surplus figures of $ 18.7 billion and 4.9% in the same quarter in 2002 .  
Comparing the first quarter of 2003 with the fourth quarter of 2002 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit increased from $ 5.6 billion to $ 16.0 billion , while the invisible trade surplus decreased from $ 52.1 billion to $ 40.1 billion .  
Mr Ma noted that Hong Kong is the Mainland 's major international capital centre .  As at end of July , a total of 242 Mainland enterprises were listed in Hong Kong , including 81 H shares companies , 73 red chips companies as well as 88 Mainland enterprises that are registered overseas .  The capital raised amounted to over HK $ 780 billion .  
For value of airborne domestic exports , decreases were registered for " electrical machinery , apparatus and appliances , and electrical parts thereof " ( by $ 2.8 billion or 45.3% ) , " professional , scientific and controlling instruments and apparatus " ( by $ 464 million or 55.4% ) and " miscellaneous manufactured articles consisting mainly of jewellery , goldsmiths ' and silversmiths ' wares " ( by $ 345 million or 9.7% ) in the first half of 2003 .  
As at end of July , a total of 242 Mainland enterprises were listed in Hong Kong , including 81 H shares companies , 73 red chips companies , as well as 88 Mainland enterprises that are registered overseas .  The capital raised amounted to over HK $ 780 billion .  
Comparing the second quarter of 2003 with the first quarter of 2003 , and bearing in mind that this comparison for the main current account components may be affected by seasonal factors , the visible trade deficit decreased from $ 16.0 billion to $ 9.8 billion , as exports of goods remained robust , while import for local use was cut back distinctly amidst the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) .  
Costing about NT $ 7.3 billion ( US $ 203 million ) and taking six years to construct , the railway was fully opened to traffic on Feb . 1 , 1980 . Traversing the mountainous region along the northeast coast of Taiwan , from Nanshenghu in Ilan County in the north to Tienpu in Hualien County in the south , the railway is part of the planned round-the-island system . It will play a major role in boosting the economy and tourism on the under-developed east coast of Taiwan as well as strengthening national defense .  
Mr . Chien said the government has stressed economic development in the past , and neglected cultural and social construction . , In the future it will try to compensate , and looks forward to achieving the following indicators by the year 2000 : * Price increases will not exceed 3.5% annually ; * The economic growth rate will reach 6.5% annually ; * Per capita GNP will reach US $ 20,000 ; * Trade volume will reach US $ 350 billion .  
Per Capita Income by the Year 2000By the year 2000 , the per capita gross national product in the Republic of China on Taiwan will exceed US $ 20,000 , a level comparable to per capita income in the highly industrialized countries of the West , and one which ranks her among the top twenty countries of the world . Estimates are that by that time the ROC 's foreign trade turnover will reach US $ 350 billion , which will make the ROC the tenth biggest trading country in the entire world .  
Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
Rising up to take advantage of this opportunity and lay a comprehensive and lasting foundation for the future of the Chinese people is the common responsibility of the 1.2 billion Chinese at home and abroad . It is also the duty of the people on our bastion of national revival , civilian and military alike , to lead the way with great wisdom , determination , and solidarity , based on our many years of experience and achievements in implementing political democracy and an economy that benefits the people .  
It so happened that the project coincided with the Ministry of Communication 's hunt for a new deepwater port facility , and a joint outline was drawn up which envisioned a reclaimed land area of 6,700 hectares , and investment of some 400 billion NT dollars . The blueprint for eventual use of the dry land area is still undergoing approval at the Council for Economic Planning and Development .  
Today Taiwan 's foreign currency reserves plus gold assets total nearly US $ 100 billion , and you still want to pollute our air , land , and rivers to increase product competitiveness to manufacture cheap products for foreigners to use ; you earn that much foreign exchange and you do nothing but issue NT dollars , creating crazy land and stock speculation , so that the middle class and young couples in Taipei ca n't afford to buy homes !  
The rapid development of technology has resulted in a gap between the living standards of the highly industrialized countries and the underdeveloped countries . As a result , the 1.2 billion people in the advanced industrial countries consume seven-eighths of the resources . And the four billion residents of the " Third World " are faced with hunger in many areas . This is also a topic that those involved in science and technology ought to consider .  
What 's more , banks have discovered that the trade surplus has continued to grow . There was US $ 2.5 billion in the first quarter of this year alone - - but most of it was not remitted to Taiwan . When one adds that capital outflow was as high as US $ 1.1 billion for the quarter , it is obvious that this wave of mainland fever is bringing capital across the strait at several times the previous rate .  
Alliance case study number five - - high definition television ( HDTV ) . The palmtop alliance is built on existing technology , to be used in specially designated products . The cost is extremely low ( the whole project has run up only an NT $ 20 million tab ) , and there have been no major technological break-throughs to speak of . In comparison , the " high definition television technology development plan , " a five-year , NT $ 3 billion project set up by the government , requires a completely different alliance model .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
Dr . Chen felt that apart from doctoring from morning till night , he should have the ability to do something else , so he decided to practice the flute with its complex fingering , for " it helps develop one 's mental capacity . " Dr . Chen says humorously that human beings have around 50 billion brain cells , but most people only use a fifth or a quarter of them throughout their lives ; the rest are left completely unused , which is a real pity .  
In terms of railroads , though the controversial budget for the high-speed train did not pass the Legislative Yuan last year , the " Regulations for Encouraging Participation " in railroad privatization did . There is a proposal to create a special high-speed railroad budget of over NT $ 120 billion to be spent over the next four to five fiscal years ( though original costs are expected to be moderated somewhat by the participation of private capital in the program ) .  
It is true these projects will take five or six years ( or even longer ) to complete , so that expenditures will be somewhat spread out , and local governments and state-run enterprises are expected to bear a small part of the burden . Nevertheless , the upshot is this : Conservatively estimated , the major projects listed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development will still require more than NT $ 300 billion per year , accounting for nearly 30% of central government expenditures .  
For example , Taipower has always claimed that the costs of nuclear power are low . But as yet there is no way to finally dispose of nuclear waste , and it will impose enormous costs on the next generation . The maximum for compensation in the event of an accident at a nuclear power plant has been set at NT $ 1.4 billion , and the law says that anything over that amount will be paid by the government , thus artificially lowering the calculated costs of nuclear power immensely .  
President Lee talked about a " Chinese renaissance " - - an ideal Chinese culture based in Confucian thought , but not distorted and rigidified by authoritarian rulers , which has also absorbed the best of modern Western culture . Can this culture grow strong in Taiwan and then influence the 1.2 billion people in mainland China , so that one day they too can be the bosses of their own government ?  
But if such views are optimistic , they do also seem to echo a voice that departed from the Chinese scene not all that long ago and which most people would not be happy to hear again . The idea that mainland China can achieve economic miracles if the population just gives up its lunch-time nap , the notion that if you multiply everything by 1.2 billion then you can beat the world , unavoidably harks back to earlier calls to " overtake Britain and catch up with America . "  
A dam is an enormous engineering structure , and an investment which has to be paid in all at once-it can not be built in easy installments . To construct a reservoir today takes an investment of over NT $ 10 billion , and Taiwan is not a good place to build reservoirs , so the return on the investment falls far short of that achieved in continental countries . Thus we should not be using reservoirs as " normal " water resources .  
At the end of September , work formally began on an investment by Acer Computer to build a multi - functional intelligent park in Taoyuan . Total investment is expected to be NT $ 200 billion . When completed , the park will have factories , residences , cultural and educational facilities , and more . It amounts to a privately funded version of the HSBIP , writing a new page for the " Invest in Taiwan " program .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
" The Colon Free Trade Zone , the world 's longest running and most successful free trade zone , handled US $ 10 billion in transshipment trade in 1995 , a figure equivalent to Taiwan 's total yearly trade with Southeast Asia .  
When speaking of this precious satellite , what worries those in charge is not only its exorbitant manufacturing cost of over NT $ 1.6 billion ( making it worth 20 times its weight in gold ) , but also that its original 1996 date of completion has already been exceeded by one year .  
Out of the national scientific research budget of NT $ 40 billion at that time , NT $ 18.5 billion was earmarked for defense technology research ; of the remaining NT $ 21.7 billion , NT $ 7 billion was set aside for NSC-directed academic research , and the other NT $ 14-plus billion was distributed among the various subordinate departments of the NSC for applied technology research .  
Most SREs are involved in activities intimately related to daily life , and are the foundation for national economic development . They may well be making huge surpluses-last year Chunghwa Telecom took in NT $ 49 billion in profits , CPC and Taipower more than NT $ 10 billion each-but that does n't mean they have been efficient . They have many shortcomings compared to similar service-providers abroad .  
Some have suggested that in the wake of the cold war , the world is too peaceful , but the nation must have enemies . And in the process of passing the EEA , the US Justice Department stressed that " economic security " was a major part of national security , as important as military security . Furthermore , it estimates that foreign governments and companies have robbed American companies of more than US $ 100 billion in profits and many millions of lost jobs by stealing trade secrets . Productivity and national power are closely linked .  
In order to smooth the way for Bayer to invest in Taichung County , the MOEA announced that after the plant begins operations , each year it will pay NT $ 1.5 billion in business tax and NT $ 150 million in building tax , and that 300 jobs will be created in total .

As for the current surplus of NT $ 40 billion that NHI has on its books , Chuang Yi-chou , director of the administrative center at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and a national policy advisor to the president , says that it was created by overestimates of the average number of dependents per family and by excess contributions from employers .  
Vincent Siew particularly emphasizes that educational reform is a firm policy of the Executive Yuan . It has already approved the " Educational Reform Stimulus Package " drafted by the Ministry of Education . Starting from 1999 , more than NT $ 150 billion will be spent over a five-year period to advance 12 educational reform projects , including " promoting education for the entire citizenry " and " encouraging diversification and increased quality in vocational education .

The recently passed budgets covering the second half of fiscal 1999 and all of fiscal 2000 ( i.e . a total of 18 months ) provide for total appropriations of more than NT $ 36.9 billion for social welfare . This accounts for 16.4% of the budget , more than for culture and education ( 16.1% ) , defense ( 15.8% ) , and economic development ( 15.7% ) . In fact , for the first time ever , social welfare is the single largest spending item in the national budget .  
If we developed all our hydroelectric resources to their full potential we would be able to generate over 5 gigawatts of electric power . It is our high mountains that bring down the rain and give us our abundant water . Average annual precipitation comes to 90 billion cubic meters , which gives the island a humid climate and luscious greenery .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market .

In July the city and the central government quarreled over how much money the city would be allotted in the national budget , and the city 's share was cut by NT $ 6 billion . Then in October the Executive Yuan lowered the population requirement for self-governing status , and Taichung City joined Taipei and Kaohsiung as a special self-administered municipality . Various other large cities and counties also hope to achieve this so as to enjoy the same status as Taipei .  
The first is globalization , which has had a dual impact . For one thing it has led to a massive expansion of the international labor force , with developing countries that previously shunned capitalist competition now hurling themselves into it , adding over a billion workers from places like mainland China , India and Eastern Europe . At the same time we have the globalization of international trade , with capital and technology increasingly free to circulate rapidly around the world .  
We decided to devote our special feature this month to the investments of Taiwanese businesses in mainland China , with which Taiwan has enjoyed annual trade surpluses of well over US $ 20 billion in recent years . We focus especially on the question of why Taiwanese high-tech manufacturers are moving offshore , and how they manage to keep afloat in the fiercely competitive market of the greater Shanghai region .  
Alarms are again going off over public safety hazards in Taiwan . The huge fire that burned through the Eastern Science Park , and the explosion at a chemicals plant in Hsinchu , both in mid-May , caused losses in the industrial sector approaching NT $ 10 billion , forcing both the government and the public to realize the urgent need to set up an integrated and comprehensive public safety system .  
The finance panel witnessed struggles between government officials and the corporate sector . The corporate sector made a number of proposals including cutting the tax for land value-added in half for two years , freezing collection of the stock transaction tax for one year , and giving government an upper debt limit . However , these proposals would have reduced government revenues by NT $ 95 billion per year . These were also resisted by scholars who argued that they would create a " bubble economy , " as well as by industrial elder statesman Wang Yung-ching .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
The combined population of countries running socialist economies either now or in the past comes to over 3 billion , or 44% of the world 's total population . The major socialist economies include mainland China ( 1.2 billion ) , India ( 1 billion ) , and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe ( 0.3 billion ) . Since the collapse of socialism , the massive labor pool of these nations has gradually been incorporated into the global capitalist economy .  
Taiwan farmers found it increasingly difficult to compete against mainland China pork on the Japanese market . Adding insult to injury , smuggled pigs brought hoof-and-mouth to Taiwan in 1996 , dealing another heavy blow to Taiwan 's livestock industry . The government issued almost NT $ 1 billion in subsidies to 6,667 farmers that agricultural agencies succeeded in encouraging to leave the livestock industry . Taiwan 's 14 million pig population was chopped in half almost overnight .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery .

As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
In May of this year , the government formally declared " digital content " to be one of the " twin star " industries . It plans to pour NT $ 5 billion into the industry over the next four years , establish a " digital content college " that will cultivate IT skills among artists and writers , and encourage venture capitalists to invest also in the hope of growing the industry 's annual production value to more than NT $ 200 billion , four times its current value , in five years .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
As a matter of fact , after assuming the KMT chairmanship in March 2000 , Lien Chan stated that after a comprehensive examination of party assets and commercial investments , it had been discovered that during Lee Teng-hui 's presidency , when Liu Tai-ying was director-general of the KMT 's Investment and Business Management Committee , there were eight highly controversial investment cases with combined total losses of NT $ 9.8 billion .

Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
For Wang Steak , which has annual revenues in Taiwan in excess of NT $ 1 billion and long ago extended its operations to the US , entry into the PRC was obviously rather late . Park Cheng explains : " We did a survey of white-collar workers several years ago and discovered that although Shanghai once did have areas controlled by Britain and France , nobody in Shanghai chose ' Western food ' as their preferred option for dinner out . "  
The development of renewable energies is also one of the pillars of the " Challenge 2008 " six-year national development plan , announced by the Executive Yuan in 2002 . The plan projects public investments of over NT $ 1 billion per year in renewables , with the stated aim that by 2020 the installed capacity of electricity generating equipment powered by renewable energy should reach 6.5 gigawatts , and account for 12% of Taiwan 's total generating capacity , or twice the current level of 6% ( including existing conventional hydroelectric capacity ) .  
Whenever heavy weather approaches , Taiwan 's beautiful landscape is increasingly marred by fear . The typhoon also flooded the city of Sanchung , Taipei County for the first time in over 30 years , after contractors cut corners in the construction of a subway line . The government now faces a compensation bill of NT $ 2 billion . The incident holds lessons for us all .  
This typhoon caused the people of Taoyuan a great deal of pain and suffering as they were forced to go without water for many days . Industrial losses are estimated at NT $ 10 billion .

Although the total investment reached $ 95 billion in 1990 , it still fell short of the 25 per cent rate , which is normally the minimum level assumed to ensure Africa 's economic growth and a steady growth of the standard of living per capita .  
The review showed that several billion dollars ' worth of projects that could reasonably be regarded as contributing to desertification control had been implemented , illustrating the developing recognition that combating desertification is not a narrow sectoral activity but requires a broad approach incorporating most aspects of environmental management in the drylands , which comprise one third of the Earth 's land surface .  
The question should be asked whether it is fair to collect the debt owed by the countries where these people live , which in many cases accounts for more than half of their limited revenues , while in the United States alone , $ 8 billion are spent on cosmetics , in the rich countries , $ 17-billion are spent on pet food and , worldwide , $ 400-billion are spent on narcotic drugs .
