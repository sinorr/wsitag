" Although we believe that a balanced package has been proposed by Government , we do not have any in principle objection to the adoption of the ' fifth leaver ' rule as the primary objectives of the exercise have been achieved .  
We are of the view that our original proposal , i.e . the adoption of the " fourth leaver " rule in an auction based on bidding on royalty percentages and minimum guarantee payments , is a balanced arrangement .  Not only does it meet the policy to allocate the licences in a fair and efficient manner , but also achieve the aim of encouraging entry into the 3G market under the current conditions of the telecommunications market .  
The open access regime we have created in Hong Kong will mean that it is not only the successful licensees who can provide innovative 3G services .

So Hong Kong is well positioned to be a world centre for 3G innovation , * said Mr Anthony Wong , Telecommunications Authority .

This will seriously impair the effective operation of the Committee in future .

In earlier days , the majority of schools and athletic centers in the ROC surfaced their tracks and baseball diamonds with either crushed brick or cinder .

A . Because the chairman of the Legislative Yuan has almost no power to decide , added to the fact that there have been a lot of protest incidents , it has been especially difficult these last two years to preside over the Yuan meetings . I have just been trying to play a fair , objective , and occasionally humorous role , to balance and mediate the confrontational situation between the supplementary legislators and the senior legislators , in order to keep the agenda moving smoothly .  
It 's worth pointing out that two years ago , when Yuan Liu participated in the world 's largest children 's book exhibition - - the Bologna Italy book fair - - they won the competition for the prize for " Best Children 's Illustrated Books " with two Chinese folk tales for children , Gumiya and The Giant and the 12 Suns .

In our report this month , you can read how these budding reporters were selected , how they have received intellectual stimulation and professional training , how through constant self-examination they have found their way from their initial bewilderment to an objective and fair perspective , and how afterjust three short months they should be able to bear the heavy responsibility of going out with cameras on their shoulders and microphones in their hands .  
The new mayor of Taipei City , Chen Shui-bian , has appointed lieutenant-general Li Tsuo-fu as director of the city 's Department of Military Service , because of his reputation for fair and upright dealing while in the army , which earned him the nickname " the Tiger . " But since ancient times the Chinese have also had the saying that " powerful people are as changeable as tigers , " implying that the actions of the powerful are as unpredictable as the patterns on tigers ' coat are variable .  
" A lot of people in society have something to say , " affirms Liu Ta-chwan , network director for Chiao Tung University 's computer center . What gives the Net a superior edge over the conventional broadcast media is that radio talk shows have inherent time limitations , and they can cut callers off if they do n't like what is being said . The BBS is different . " It is basically very fair , because the capacity is unlimited . "  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
Second , because the members of these societies do n't have a high level of education , the clubs are very much a part of local Taiwanese culture - - virtual reflections of common Taiwanese society .

Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible .

In 1994 , when the Council for Cultural Planning and Development first expanded its arts festival to include all of Taiwan , Paoankung ( listed as a temple ) put on the " Paosheng Culture Festival .

The excitement went on for a whole month .

On returning home and closely examining the branch he had broken off under the lamplight , he saw " beads of sweat on that fair countenance , " and realized the branch was thick with both plum flowers and snow .  
One educational reformer has commented that , in this age of " free market education " where textbooks have become " intellectual commodities , " it is difficult to expect publishers not to concern themselves with business and other factors not related to education . But the bigger question is , are the rules of the new privatized education game fair ? Are they consistent ?  
" The only purpose of financial operations is to turn a profit . There 's no such thing as moral or immoral , and no such thing as it being fair or unfair to hardworking individual countries or firms , " says Ding Kung-wha , highlighting the pragmatic and unsentimental nature of the financial world .  
The Taipei District Court ruled that although the topic of Ho Ya-wei 's report-about how Huang Chao-fu had spent NT $ 20 million in his first campaign as a KMT nominee for the legislature but received only 200 votes-could be described as " fair game . . . its sarcasm virtually dripped from the page . . . Because this affected the reputation of the plaintiff 's private moral character , the defendant was clearly acting maliciously . "  
When the rhododendrons began flowering in March , the annual round of recruitment fairs got under way on campuses all over Taiwan . Graduates of National Taiwan Normal University ( NTNU ) always used to have an " iron rice bowl " - a guarantee of a job in teaching . But since the Ministry of Education relaxed entrance requirements for the teaching profession , they too have faced the same problem that " graduation equals unemployment , " and for the first time ever a recruitment fair has been held on the NTNU campus .  
The most novel interpretation of the tales of love between immortals and regular human beings appears in a book published in Taiwan , in which the author argues that the denizens of heaven are sapped of their sex drive by perpetually fair weather , beautiful clothing , delectable food , and centuries of living at a metabolic rate of zero .  
" But I gradually discovered that I was not suited to heterosexual marriage . If I did n't take cognizance of my homosexual orientation , and continued in the marriage , it would not have been fair to my wife or family .

The first few emperors of the Han dynasty knew full well the difficulty of claiming dominion over the whole country , and emphasized " quality " in the appointment of their officials .

Viewed in the longer perspective , different priorities have applied at different phases of Taiwan 's agricultural development . At present , it 's a question not just of the livelihood of farmers , but also of concerns like joining the WTO , national security and the definition of the nation . So how do farmers ' interests weigh against the overall interests of the nation ? It 's a question that calls for calm discussion by all involved , and the government needs to set up a fair system for mediation among all concerned .  
At a time when multi-track admissions have yet to meet with widespread support among parents and teachers , an unfortunate incident occurred at the end of February . It was discovered that students at about a dozen junior high schools had been leaked the answers to the mock joint exams . This led to fears that the multiple track admissions policy was not as fair as the joint entrance exam .  
To be fair , the National Assembly does have its unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready to call for its complete abolition . This is especially notable given the ambiguity of Taiwan 's constitutional structure , seeing as it is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two-headed system in the true sense .  
Perhaps out of a woman 's unique empathy for the disadvantaged , Chang Fu-mei is particularly concerned with issues that ordinarily seem inconsequential to politicians and the media . When a female postal worker complained of discriminatory testing , and a young man suffered constant harassment by tax authorities after his ID card was used for someone else 's tax file , Chang took their cases to administrative authorities for the fair treatment they deserved . In her view , such efforts represent her most worthy accomplishments .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Chen Ai-ni , an expert on gender and marriage , says that emphasizing human rights in marriage is not meant to put one 's spouse " on warning " or to make divorce more fair . Rather it is to preserve marriage and secure the foundations of happiness between husband and wife . Chen believes that it can effectively deter physical and psychological domestic violence , which would be the first step in " happiness engineering . "  
The elected heads of Taipei County , Taichung City , Tainan City , Ilan County , and other local governments around Taiwan are in virtually unanimous agreement that " the central government should completely re-think its revenue sharing philosophy and formulate consistent criteria for determining a fair distribution . Such criteria might include population , land area , and degree of need . "  
To be fair , this time around government agencies at every level were unstinting in their rescue efforts , communication and command systems worked well , and the response was swift . The problem was that the disaster covered such a vast area and came so quickly . Many mudslides and flash floods came with little or no warning , so that people could only watch helplessly as their loved ones were swallowed up or swept away , to be parted from them forever .  
Combining a mild outward appearance with a man-of-action personality lurking just beneath the surface , Robert Huang is actually rather similar to the seemingly stoic but untamably adventurous Victorian Englishmen that he admires . It probably is n't fair to attribute the success of Rose House , with its emphasis on Victorian style , to simple chance .  
Yet , whether or not the adjustment of the ratios was professional and fair , the government 's entire funding pie had not grown larger , so if more was going to the 23 counties and cities , that meant the special municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung would have to learn to live with less . Not surprisingly , the new plan met with fierce opposition in both cities .  
" Beginning in 2002 , the communist authorities founded the Overseas Satellite Agency . All legally authorized satellite TV stations will broadcast via the SinoSat 3 satellite which will be managed in a unified manner , " says Asia Plus Broadcasting 's Sammy Yang . In the future , all foreign-based satellite TV stations will have to play under the same set of rules and equal access , thus giving Taiwan a relatively fair opportunity to compete .  
Helen studied at the Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology but did not graduate , or go on to serve in the medical field . Instead she became involved in sales , and over the course of many years of fair and honest dealing she accumulated a large number of business connections , which serves as a resource for her work rescuing abandoned animals .  
For fifty years people in Taiwan have worked their fingers to the bone to improve living standards and have neglected the beautiful mountains and rivers lying at their feet . The " non-smokestack " tourism industry has not , over the years , received its fair share of attention , but as we enter the 21st century and the economy , science and technology all move steadily onward and upward , the situation is finally changing .  
Chen Huai-en of the Department of Visual Communication Design at National Yunlin University of Science thinks that our aesthetic sensibility is still influenced by our rural past , and we have a scant aesthetic conception of foreign societies . He says that despite our hideous surroundings , a fair number of Taiwanese have developed a critical consciousness and are looking forward to an aesthetic society .

To achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development we need a supportive and favourable international economic environment as well as a fair , open and non-discriminatory trading system , one which recognizes that small and vulnerable economies like our own are at a particular disadvantage because of our size and the lack of economies of scale .  
Peace can only be maintained by observing such norms governing international relations as respect for State sovereignty and territorial integrity , mutual non-aggression , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality and mutual benefit , and peaceful coexistence , and by establishing , in accordance with the United Nations Charter , a new international political and economic order that is just and fair .  
The so-called underdeveloped world is not calling on the international community for hand-outs or privileged positions in trade ; all it is asking for is fair , transparent and egalitarian treatment , with terms of trade that are not distorted by political pricing , hidden subsidies and dumping practices whose persistence in international trade causes real havoc in the economies of a large number of nations .  
Unless management is given the ability and freedom to recruit professional staff of the highest calibre , from anywhere in the world and this can be done only if remuneration is internationally competitive and if Governments refrain from interfering in a fair selection process it will be hard , if not impossible , to achieve the continuous improvement in quality and efficiency that is rightly called for in the secretariats of United Nations organizations .

The Inter _ American Court of Human Rights , for example , in a ground _ breaking ruling , found that amnesty for the perpetrators of serious human rights violations was incompatible with the right of every individual to a fair hearing before an impartial and independent court .  
Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .  
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
Many States have successfully implemented comparatively rapid procedures at points of entry which ensure a fair and competent assessment of the need for international protection , and UNHCR encourages States to ensure the rights of the individual through proper legal safeguards , in developing such procedures .  
Reaffirming that development is a comprehensive economic , social , cultural and political progress , which aims at the constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals on the basis of their active , free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair distribution of benefits resulting therefrom ,

Finally , the existing discriminatory and exclusive export control mechanisms and arrangements should be overhauled and rectified .  A fair and rational international non-proliferation system should be established through negotiations , with the participation of all countries concerned .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The factors for promoting an international environment conducive to development included the creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable economic conditions , democratization and the establishment of open , common , fair and transparent rules that offered equal opportunities for all .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .

Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .

But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .

As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
However , the Inspectors considered that examination of the issues in the report was timely since they believed that a modern , fair , and transparent personnel policy , of which placement and promotion were an important part , and its strict implementation , were crucial determinants of effective future performance of the United Nations .

A .

Efforts have to be made to ensure that workers in developing countries receive fair remunerations , related to those paid in developed countries , and are not exploited for the mere economic benefit of transnational corporations .

This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
The factors for promoting an international environment conducive to development included the creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable economic conditions , democratization and the establishment of open , common , fair and transparent rules that offered equal opportunities for all .

Our increased input of international experience and police skills in order to support the police of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fighting crime and maintaining public security will remain ineffective without a democratically legitimized judicial system that guarantees fair investigations and trials as well as acceptable circumstances of detention .

But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .

As stated in his previous report , the Special Representative believes that the speedy creation of an independent electoral commission would send an unambiguous signal to the people of Cambodia that the Government of Cambodia is committed to free and fair elections .  
However , the Inspectors considered that examination of the issues in the report was timely since they believed that a modern , fair , and transparent personnel policy , of which placement and promotion were an important part , and its strict implementation , were crucial determinants of effective future performance of the United Nations .  
The competent authorities shall do their utmost to ensure that the Authority shall be provided , on fair and equitable terms but in any case not less favourable than those accorded to the agencies of the Government , with necessary utilities and public services , including but not limited to electricity , water , gas , sewerage , collection of waste , fire protection and local transportation .

In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .

While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .

For the purposes of realizing the will of the people and their right to self-determination , creating a responsible Government , preventing a monopoly of power and administrative corruption , electing representatives to the electoral bodies , ensuring free and fair periodical election of the leadership ; the principles of democracy and pluralism shall constitute the mainspring of the future political system to be formed in Afghanistan .
