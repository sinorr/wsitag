"  
May you grow old together " is a traditional good-luck wish for newlyweds . However , according to historians , the chances of that wish coming true were mighty slim in days past .

The Bureau of Entry and Exit in the Ministry of Interior Affairs has decided in principle to verify entry and exit permits by the method of computer barcodes instead of the visual verification system currently in effect in order to facilitate the entry and exit of compatriots from mainland China coming to Taiwan to attend funerals or visit ailing relatives as well as the entry and exit of the general public and to better guard against the surreptitious exit of economic criminals and other illegal elements from the country .  
My main subject has always been the history of Buddhism in China and how it was changed by Chinese culture . I have also studied the history of the coming of Christianity to China during the late Ming and early Ch'ing , including how China received and transformed the influence and the Chinese reaction to it , such as the Taiping rebellion . That is the process that interests me most .  
Yet a number of scholars think Taiwan in some ways is very lucky because a lot of its high-atmosphere pollutants are blown away by northeasterly seasonal winds and southwesterly air currents and swept out into the Pacific . So for the time being there is still no need for Taiwan to worry about acid rain coming from far afield on high altitude air currents .  
I think the reason is still the latter , " says Lin . Thinking a moment , he says slowly , " Ten years ago , local bankers asked us , ' In the past it was always the advanced countries investing in backward countries , there were no developing nations coming to developed nations .

From the anxious youth of Lou Ti , to the love of home and country of the overseas student of Women ti Ke , the broken dream of returning home in Fei-ts'ui Chieh-chih , up to the coming together of China and the West in the period of the Boxer Rebellion , Chao Shu-hsia has written down the heavy burden of her own heart while also speaking out about the sorrow and suffering of the overseas Chinese .  
We spoke frankly , I watched the meeting and the election , and I attended the dinner . The piece de resistance was the seminar I chaired .

There are fewer and fewer kids coming along each year now : Two years ago the school still counted 37 heads , with 24 remaining last year , and only an even dozen this year .

As these stocks have hit the market one after another , large amounts of old Pu'er tea have once again been seeing the light of day . These warehouse clearances started selling off this Pu'er tea at rock bottom prices .

The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate .

For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine .

"  
Two or three hundred years ago Hakka began coming to Taiwan and settled in relatively interior , mountainous areas in what is now the Pingtung-Kaohsiung region in southern Taiwan and the Taoyuan-Miaoli region in central Taiwan .

The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Or put a cover on the water containers that you are using , so that mosquitoes ca n't come down to lay their eggs . Environmental and health agencies at all levels have been making themselves hoarse telling people to " do their bit , " yet there are still those who turn a deaf ear . Many people see the insecticide sprayers coming and hurry out to tell them to spray into puddles or sewers , which are filled with dirty stagnant water .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket .

"  
Vegetable substitutes for poultry , red meat , and all kinds of seafood can in fact taste even better than the real thing .

At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down .

To refamiliarize himself with the old stomping grounds , he signed up to be a guide with the Takao Hill Association . " The more I came to understand it , the more I treasured this piece of earth .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
About 400 years ago people began coming over to Taiwan from Fujian and Guangdong in search of land to farm . Faced with the perilous sea voyage and the hazardous life of pioneers , they naturally had a strong need for some authoritative guidance in determining the best ( and worst ) times to act .  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .

There were even people providing channels for directly purchasing medications and inoculations from abroad . " One thing she found especially remarkable was the frequent sight of can after can of some nameless inky black liquid on the bedside tables of patients .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
On the steep slope of a tea plantation , two Kuhl 's brown frogs , with teeth protruding from their lower cheeks , are engaged in an instinctive struggle over territory ; it is hard to say who is coming out ahead .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation .

He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
Recalling how hard it was back then , just she and four students in a lumbering old military transport plane , the always hearty Chou laughs and relates : " The thing we were most afraid of was landing on the wrong side .

While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .

This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens .

After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
A pathology report prepared by Chang Tsung-chou , a professor in the department of veterinary medicine at National Pingtung University of Science and Technology , said that contributing factors in Eva 's death included congestive heart disease , multiple localized hepatitis , and a swollen thyroid gland .

Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
You can see incorrect usage wherever you look . I 'll give you some examples . After mainland tour groups started coming to Taiwan , I was hired to train local tour guides .

True , these books may sell far less than the dazzling numbers pulled in by the best-sellers , but look at it another way . In terms of the total amount published , this steady , solid flow of books coming in from the mainland is already making serious incursions into the literary mass market .  
The Taiwan Minpao carried many excerpts from the notebooks that Chiang kept in prison . From them we can see that he not only made friends with gangsters , but was quite interested in the culture and language of their world , and planned to produce a dictionary of gangster lingo after coming out of prison . At the same time , he was deeply pained by the way the gangsters wasted their courage on fighting against their guards , frequently being injured and growing weak and dispirited as a result .  
Eric Lin / tr . by Phil Newell We may only have just opened chapter one of the 21st century , but already the twists and turns in the world are coming so fast that it makes your head spin .

In the region threatened by bird flu , Taiwan alone has remained clean . There have been sporadic outbreaks of fowl pest around the island , but thus far they have all involved the less pathogenic and less virulent H5N2 virus strain , which does not infect humans . This is why , with the massive cull of poultry leading to a shortage of chickens in several Asian countries , Taiwanese chickens have unexpectedly become much sought after , with orders coming in from various neighboring territories .  
As Japan and Korea take active steps to expand their trade with China , they require many workers who can speak Chinese , which has resulted in a sudden increase in the number of Asian faces , including many Chinese-Americans , coming to Taiwan to study Chinese . Their main reason for choosing Taiwan is that they feel that living and getting around in Taiwan is more convenient .

Gourds would become a way of life , a creative lynchpin , and the foundation for making the village self-sufficient .

Through Kung 's works , more and more people are coming to appreciate the beauty inherent in even something as simple as a gourd .  
But even if he was often scatterbrained and had a dull look in his eyes off the field , he was extraordinary when he took the mound , almost never disappointing Coach Huang . With a 145-km / h fastball coming off his hand , a slow breaking ball that cut a huge arc on its way to the plate , and a tricky slider , hitters on the opposing teams could see Wu 's pitches dance their way to the plate , but one after another they failed to get a bat on the ball .  
Conservative estimates indicate that in urban schools , each classroom sees on average two or three emotionally disturbed students or students coming from problem families .

The end of Autumn Chrysanthemum is a happy scene of great coming together amidst the conflict between different ethnic groups . The children from the military dependents villages used the fraternal method of financial gifts and peace mediation ( in Wu Chin-fa 's eyes , the children from the military dependents villages had the most resources in those years ) , to smooth over the conflicts between Fukienese-Taiwanese and Hakka-Taiwanese factions , and resolve a scene of bloody conflict .  
His chance finally came in June of that year when an injured foreign player for the Giants was put on the disabled list . This freed up a spot on the major league roster , and Lu filled it . " I did n't think I 'd play for a while after coming up , " Lu recalls , " and was caught by surprise when manager Wang Chen-chih put me in the starting lineup . "  
Their function in tribal societyThere is no way to ascertain the true origin of the facial tattoos , but in the Atayals ' daily lives they did have great social meaning and function , including distinguishing tribal origin , announcing the coming of age , beautifying the appearance , preventing the spread of evil , signifying bravery and displaying the height of feminine weaving skills .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
For example , on occasion the Central Weather Bureau will make a special broadcast warning of impending heavy downpours of rain , but on the succeeding day , everybody will enjoy perfect sunshine . He will still have to be brazen-faced , go up to the counter and explain : " Because of a sudden increase in the high atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean , the heavy downfall of rain was prevented from coming down . "  
Two or three hundred years ago Hakka began coming to Taiwan and settled in relatively interior , mountainous areas in what is now the Pingtung-Kaohsiung region in southern Taiwan and the Taoyuan-Miaoli region in central Taiwan . Here they extended their experience in pioneering harsh and demanding terrain , and their characteristic traits were passed down from generation to generation .  
Now our ' Little Cutey ' is afraid that the audience seated in the rear wo n't get a clear view , so she is coming down from the stage to meet everybody . Please , everyone , look but do n't touch . " When the hostess finished her speech , " Little Cutey " walked down the stage , her hand held in that of a handsome male volunteer , and circled the audience one time .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
Kong recalls that life in the mainland was already burdened with more than enough heavy symbolism . " Under that kind of stress , people lost sight of and then completely forgot many ordinary feelings - - things like appreciating nature , missing one 's home , treasuring one 's family and friends , experiencing the change of seasons , and coming to some understanding of life just by living it , not to mention something as forbidden as love between the sexes . "  
But after many years of development , densely populated Hong Kong has a shortage of living space , and the developed area of the colony has steadily expanded . It has been impossible for Rennie 's Mill to avoid being drawn into these changes . And things get even more complicated when you consider what the coming of 1997 means , given the town 's political orientation .  
Or put a cover on the water containers that you are using , so that mosquitoes ca n't come down to lay their eggs . Environmental and health agencies at all levels have been making themselves hoarse telling people to " do their bit , " yet there are still those who turn a deaf ear . Many people see the insecticide sprayers coming and hurry out to tell them to spray into puddles or sewers , which are filled with dirty stagnant water .  
Even though I was unable to celebrate the coming of the new spring with my kith and kin , our branch of the family did our very best , by dining on hot pot , wearing new clothes , letting my child don a little traditional suit of skullcap and cotton jacket . He was curious , and we felt joyful inside watching him . Here , the Lunar New Year is a special celebration for Chinese people , not a public holiday with time off from work .  
But Taiwan is a major trading area , and includes the world 's third busiest port ( Kaohsiung ) . Ships come and go 24 hours a day , and there are countless business travelers and tourists . Meanwhile dealers are constantly coming up with new ways to smuggle contraband - - tucked into ship containers , hidden away in luggage , even inserted or swallowed into the human body .  
One well established teacher spotted an office building in busy downtown Taipei where one floor was going for nearly NT $ 70 million . He wanted to buy space for classes , but the complex 's management committee completely rejected him , fearing that " the people coming in and out of buxibans are a mixed bag , and it would hurt the building 's image . "  
Vegetable substitutes for poultry , red meat , and all kinds of seafood can in fact taste even better than the real thing . Chinese have always set great store by selecting holiday foods that symbolize high hopes for the coming year .

At museums , on the street , at sidewalk stands , in temples , at the vanguard of urban design , and in the shifting light and shadows of the city , looking for the value of existence , I 'm oppressed by a nightmare that piles up over my head as thick as clouds , blocking the road ahead . Masses of people coming , masses of people going , and I 'm just living on here in this empty , preposterous world of corruption and waste .  
However , Chang Chinli , executive director of the Modern Women 's Foundation , who was involved in the legislative process from start to finish , says that not only was this outcome too long in coming , the law had been substantially watered down .

There are many steps leading up the sharply rising platforms ( pyramid-like structures but level on top rather than coming to an apex ) , testing the endurance of tourists . The site also has the earliest astronomical observatory in Mesoamerica .  
Born and raised in Kaohsiung , Chen left his home for a decade , coming to Taipei to attend university and graduate school and to work . He moved back to Kaohsiung only in 1993 , and only then did he discover how much his old hometown had changed . To refamiliarize himself with the old stomping grounds , he signed up to be a guide with the Takao Hill Association . " The more I came to understand it , the more I treasured this piece of earth .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
About 400 years ago people began coming over to Taiwan from Fujian and Guangdong in search of land to farm . Faced with the perilous sea voyage and the hazardous life of pioneers , they naturally had a strong need for some authoritative guidance in determining the best ( and worst ) times to act .  
With the advancement of medical science , the complex effects of traumatic experiences are gradually coming to be understood . This increase in understanding is also making apparent the inadequacy of traditional treatments and the necessity for professional help .  
For example , popular legend has it that the wood in coffin shops emits sounds , which are the souls of the deceased coming to choose their own coffins . Lin explains , with scientific basis , that the sound comes from the wood drying and splitting under the northeast seasonal winds , and is completely unrelated to spirits .  
Although investigation of the relationship between climate and infectious diseases is still at a preliminary stage , excessive human development of jungles and rainforests has increased people 's chances of coming into contact with the microorganisms which live there , and with their natural hosts .  
The end of World War II was followed by the collapse of the traditional colonial empires . New intellectual currents , new political forces , and new hopes and dreams were coming to the fore . Everything was changing at vertiginous speed . It was a time of great possibilities .  
When the northeast monsoon was at its peak in early December , stormy skies , strong winds and ferocious waves made coming to this small island off Taiwan 's southeast coast feel like boarding a forlorn little boat that was liable to capsize at any moment .  
" It did n't matter whether they knew you or not , every day people were coming around the patients ' beds talking about this or that famous doctor , secret cure , medicine , or cancer-related group . There were even people providing channels for directly purchasing medications and inoculations from abroad . " One thing she found especially remarkable was the frequent sight of can after can of some nameless inky black liquid on the bedside tables of patients .  
Scholars of this period preferred to work directly from original material rather than plowing through heaps of derivative writings . For example , the Song literary lion Ouyang Xiu was especially fond of rubbings taken from the inscriptions on ancient bronzes , and epigraphy-the study of stone and bronze inscriptions-was popular as a way of coming into contact with the age of antiquity .  
On the steep slope of a tea plantation , two Kuhl 's brown frogs , with teeth protruding from their lower cheeks , are engaged in an instinctive struggle over territory ; it is hard to say who is coming out ahead .  
The 15-member committee finished its three-month review on September 15 without coming to a conclusive decision , with individual committee members in sharp disagreement over the per-kilowatt cost of nuclear power , the cost of canceling construction , and the cost to society of having a nuclear plant in operation . Many have criticized the Re-Evaluation Committee as " a complete waste of money , time , and energy . "  
Not long after coming to Taiwan , Ho prepared a study entitled " Developing Organization behind Enemy Lines and Establishing Intangible Bases , " and sent it to Chiang Ching-kuo . Ho was summoned to meet with Chiang , and as a consequence was allowed to enter the army academy , from which he graduated ( in Class 20 ) at the " ripe old age " of 39 . But he did not enjoy any further special successes in his military career .  
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold , and group visits are already booked solid to the end of January . Many schools in central and southern Taiwan are renting buses by the dozen to ferry their students up to Taipei , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .  
" The biggest achievement is that the flowers have n't been stolen , " says Tsao Chi-hung . " As more people volunteer to help , disruptive behavior becomes less and less likely . " The riverside area used to be a teenage hangout , known for its drinking and fighting , but since greenification the town 's residents have been coming here to stroll and enjoy the scenery : green hills to the East , the sunset in the West , and the dreamy river alongside the park .  
He then issued a second statement , mainly to apologize for his previous gaffe , but this gesture was late in coming , and did little to assuage his critics , who continue to lambaste him . The most regrettable aspect of the whole brouhaha is the fact that it has thrown salt on the wounds of Taiwan 's former comfort women and focused painful public attention upon them once again . No one should have to go through what these women have endured .  
Recalling how hard it was back then , just she and four students in a lumbering old military transport plane , the always hearty Chou laughs and relates : " The thing we were most afraid of was landing on the wrong side . As we were coming in on our approach , a student said to me , ' We 're OK . The sign says Recover the Mainland ! , not Liberate Taiwan ! ' "  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
Beijing 's grand scale is truly dumbfounding . The speed of its coming economic growth poses challenges to its water and power supplies , air quality , and natural environment , as well as the well-being of its ancient buildings and cultural artifacts , which date back thousands of years .  
Then , in the 1930s , Bell Laboratories in the US detected radio waves coming from the Milky Way galaxy , and researchers became aware that there are many signals in the universe that are invisible to the naked eye . Some of these electromagnetic waves can pass through dust clouds that block visible light , and can thereby reveal many unknown celestial worlds .  
This is why MTI set up its new factory in Wuxi ( in mainland China 's Jiangsu Province ) , which began turning out products in September . Seeing that Wuxi is less developed than nearby Suzhou , the company reasoned that most of its employees would be local people , not workers coming in from other cities just for the fast buck , and therefore there would be lower turnover . Jiangsu girls are also famous for their attention to detail and their manual dexterity , and they can handle this kind of painstaking work .  
Tzeng Ren-yow remarks , " Over the last two or three years , attention has been focused on flooding . " However , Tzeng himself is far more concerned about the coming drought . " Droughts are more costly than floods . Fields lie fallow ; reservoirs run short of water ; factories have their water cut off ; there is little water for residential use ; rivers become less able to cleanse themselves . . . .  
Moreover , because the cafe was located right next to the Hsimenting movie theater district , it attracted many young people , especially when blockbusters were showing on nearby cinema screens . The cafe would be filled with movie-going students , some of whom would order a single cup of coffee and stay an entire afternoon , and whom the proprietors never felt right about asking to move on . After a while , other customers stopped coming , and Literary Salon was forced to close .  
A pathology report prepared by Chang Tsung-chou , a professor in the department of veterinary medicine at National Pingtung University of Science and Technology , said that contributing factors in Eva 's death included congestive heart disease , multiple localized hepatitis , and a swollen thyroid gland .

DPP legislator Eugene Jao suggested that public hearings be held during the upcoming legislative session to solicit the views of the public concerning how to achieve passage of a political contributions law . Since the ruling and opposition parties have already been working to hammer out a mutually acceptable bill , Jao feels that there is still hope for the coming session .  
Will Chen Shui-bian be able to repeat his performance of three years ago , when his chance of victory was thought to be slim , but he went into the campaign full of confidence and energy and ultimately won the presidency ? Given his past record of coming out on top against all odds , it will be worth waiting to see if Chen will once again defeat his political opponents and the wheel of Taiwanese democracy will make another successful turn .  
You can see incorrect usage wherever you look . I 'll give you some examples . After mainland tour groups started coming to Taiwan , I was hired to train local tour guides . I advised them to be sure that visitors from Shandong Province would n't be offended by the ubiquitous shop signs advertising lu rou fan ( rice topped with chunks of pork stewed in black bean sauce ) .  
True , these books may sell far less than the dazzling numbers pulled in by the best-sellers , but look at it another way . In terms of the total amount published , this steady , solid flow of books coming in from the mainland is already making serious incursions into the literary mass market .  
The Taiwan Minpao carried many excerpts from the notebooks that Chiang kept in prison . From them we can see that he not only made friends with gangsters , but was quite interested in the culture and language of their world , and planned to produce a dictionary of gangster lingo after coming out of prison . At the same time , he was deeply pained by the way the gangsters wasted their courage on fighting against their guards , frequently being injured and growing weak and dispirited as a result .  
Eric Lin / tr . by Phil Newell We may only have just opened chapter one of the 21st century , but already the twists and turns in the world are coming so fast that it makes your head spin . Taiwanese have always prided themselves on their adaptability and nose for the latest in global trends , but in an age in which even industrial technology comes and goes in the blink of an eye , even the most agile individual is likely to find him - or herself buffeted by time 's waves into unforeseen directions .  
In the region threatened by bird flu , Taiwan alone has remained clean . There have been sporadic outbreaks of fowl pest around the island , but thus far they have all involved the less pathogenic and less virulent H5N2 virus strain , which does not infect humans . This is why , with the massive cull of poultry leading to a shortage of chickens in several Asian countries , Taiwanese chickens have unexpectedly become much sought after , with orders coming in from various neighboring territories .  
As Japan and Korea take active steps to expand their trade with China , they require many workers who can speak Chinese , which has resulted in a sudden increase in the number of Asian faces , including many Chinese-Americans , coming to Taiwan to study Chinese . Their main reason for choosing Taiwan is that they feel that living and getting around in Taiwan is more convenient . They also feel that Taiwan , as a melting pot of American and Japanese culture , is friendlier to foreigners and that there are fewer chances of culture shock .  
Gourds would become a way of life , a creative lynchpin , and the foundation for making the village self-sufficient . Over the years , Kung Yi-fang has used his amazing imagination and selfless attitude to develop and teach his craft , successfully bringing art out of the constrictive world of glass display cases and into the real world . Through Kung 's works , more and more people are coming to appreciate the beauty inherent in even something as simple as a gourd .  
But even if he was often scatterbrained and had a dull look in his eyes off the field , he was extraordinary when he took the mound , almost never disappointing Coach Huang . With a 145-km / h fastball coming off his hand , a slow breaking ball that cut a huge arc on its way to the plate , and a tricky slider , hitters on the opposing teams could see Wu 's pitches dance their way to the plate , but one after another they failed to get a bat on the ball .  
Conservative estimates indicate that in urban schools , each classroom sees on average two or three emotionally disturbed students or students coming from problem families . " I 've even seen students who have sold sex on the Internet , and others who have been sexually abused in their own homes ! " says teacher Li Man-yun of Taipei 's Peicheng Junior High School . Indeed , such issues are beyond the professional capacities of teachers , and call for the assistance of social service agencies .

The celebration in a few days ' time of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations will mark the Organization 's coming of age , and will also be an opportunity to lay the foundations for forms of international cooperation free from the ideological confrontation of the past , and directed firmly towards global challenges .

The Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the Summit , containing an important set of commitments and recommendations to be implemented , became a historic landmark that established the international consensus on the goals to be pursued and achieved in the area of social development for the coming decades .  
It is therefore with great apprehension that we note a proliferation of regional conflicts , social and economic collapse in some of our countries , environmental decay , and the coming of new scourges such as transnational crime , drug trafficking , a rising wave of criminality , racial disturbances , xenophobia , and religious and cultural intolerance .

For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?
